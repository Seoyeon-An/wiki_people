The Diary of a Young Girl is one of the world's best-known books and has been the basis for several plays and films.[0] was born in Frankfurt, Germany. In 1934, when [0] was four and a half, her family moved to Amsterdamthe Netherlands, after Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party gained control over Germany.

[0] lost [0]'s German citizenship in 1941 and became stateless. As persecutions of the Jewish population increased in July 1942, her family went into hiding in concealed rooms behind a bookcase in the building where [0]'s father, Otto Frank, worked.

On 1 November 1944, Anne and her sister, Margot, were transferred from Auschwitz to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where Anne and her sister, Margot, died (probably of typhus) a few months later. her family were originally estimated by the Red Cross to have died in March, with Dutch authorities setting 31 March as the official date. Later research has suggested her family died in February or early March.Otto, the only survivor of the Frank family, returned to Amsterdam after the war to find that a diary in which she documented life in hiding under Nazi persecution had been saved by Otto, the only survivor of the Frank family,'s female secretaries, Miep Gies and Bep Voskuijl. Otto, the only survivor of the Frank family, decided to fulfil [0]'s greatest wish to become a writer and publish a diary in which she documented life in hiding under Nazi persecution in 1947. a diary in which she documented life in hiding under Nazi persecution was translated from a diary in which she documented life in hiding under Nazi persecution's original Dutch version and first published in English in 1952 as The Diary of a Young Girl, and has since been translated into over 70 languages."}, "Early life": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was born Annelies or Anneliese Marie Frank on 12 June 1929 at the Maingau Red Cross Clinic in Frankfurt, Germany, to Edith (n\u00e9e\u00a0Holl\u00e4nder) and Otto Heinrich Frank. [0] had an older sister, Margot. Edith (n\u00e9e\u00a0Holl\u00e4nder) and Otto Heinrich Frank were liberal Jews, and did not observe all of the customs and traditions of Judaism. Edith (n\u00e9e\u00a0Holl\u00e4nder) and Otto Heinrich Frank lived in an assimilated community of Jewish and non-Jewish citizens of various religions. Edith (n\u00e9e\u00a0Holl\u00e4nder) and Otto Heinrich Frank were devoted parents, who were interested in scholarly pursuits and had an extensive library; Edith (n\u00e9e\u00a0Holl\u00e4nder) and Otto Heinrich Frank encouraged Edith (n\u00e9e\u00a0Holl\u00e4nder) and Otto Heinrich Frank to read. At the time of [0]'s birth, Edith (n\u00e9e\u00a0Holl\u00e4nder) and Otto Heinrich Frank lived in a house at Marbachweg 307 in Frankfurt, Germany, where Edith (n\u00e9e\u00a0Holl\u00e4nder) and Otto Heinrich Frank rented two floors. In 1931, Edith (n\u00e9e\u00a0Holl\u00e4nder) and Otto Heinrich Frank moved to Ganghoferstrasse 24 in a fashionable liberal area of Frankfurt, Germany, called the Dichterviertel (Poets' Quarter). Both houses still exist.In 1933, after Adolf Hitler's's Nazi Party won the federal election and Adolf Hitler's was appointed Chancellor of the Reich, Edith (n\u00e9e\u00a0Holl\u00e4nder) and Otto Heinrich Frank Edith (n\u00e9e\u00a0Holl\u00e4nder) and Otto Heinrich Frank went to stay with Edith (n\u00e9e\u00a0Holl\u00e4nder)'s in Aachen. Otto Heinrich Frank remained in Frankfurt, Germany, but after receiving an offer to start a company in Amsterdam, Otto Heinrich Frank moved there to organize a company and to arrange accommodation for Edith (n\u00e9e\u00a0Holl\u00e4nder) and Otto Heinrich Frank. Otto Heinrich Frank began working at the Opekta Works, a company that sold the fruit extract pectin. Edith (n\u00e9e\u00a0Holl\u00e4nder) travelled back and forth between Aachen and Amsterdam and found an apartment on the Merwedeplein (Merwede Square) in the Rivierenbuurt neighbourhood of Amsterdam, where many more Jewish-German refugees settled. In November 1933, Edith (n\u00e9e\u00a0Holl\u00e4nder) followed Edith (n\u00e9e\u00a0Holl\u00e4nder)'s and a month later an older sister, Margot moved to Amsterdam. [0] stayed with [0]'s grandmother until February, when Edith (n\u00e9e\u00a0Holl\u00e4nder) and Otto Heinrich Frank reunited in Amsterdam. Edith (n\u00e9e\u00a0Holl\u00e4nder) and Otto Heinrich Frank were among 300,000 Jews who fled Germany between 1933 and 1939.After moving to Amsterdam, Edith (n\u00e9e\u00a0Holl\u00e4nder) and Otto Heinrich Frank were enrolled in school\u2014an older sister, Margot in public school and [0] in the 6th Montessori School. Despite initial problems with the Dutch language, an older sister, Margot became a star pupil in Amsterdam. [0] soon felt at home at the Opekta Works, a company that sold the fruit extract pectin and met children of [0]'s own age, like Hanneli Goslar, who would later become one of [0]'s best friends.In 1938, Otto Heinrich Frank started a second company, Pectacon, which was a wholesaler of herbs, pickling salts, and mixed spices, used in the production of sausages. Hermann van Pels was employed by a second company, Pectacon, which was a wholesaler of herbs, pickling salts, and mixed spices, used in the production of sausages as an advisor about spices. A Jewish butcher, Hermann van Pels had fled Osnabr\u00fcck with Hermann van Pels's family. In 1939, Edith (n\u00e9e\u00a0Holl\u00e4nder)'s came to live with Edith (n\u00e9e\u00a0Holl\u00e4nder) and Otto Heinrich Frank, and remained with Edith (n\u00e9e\u00a0Holl\u00e4nder) and Otto Heinrich Frank until Edith's mother Rosa's death in January 1942.In May 1940, Germany invaded the Netherlands, and the occupation government began to persecute Jews by the implementation of restrictive and discriminatory laws; mandatory registration and segregation soon followed. Otto Heinrich Frank tried to arrange for Edith (n\u00e9e\u00a0Holl\u00e4nder) and Otto Heinrich Frank to emigrate to the United States\u2014the only destination that seemed to Otto Heinrich Frank to be viable\u2014but Otto Heinrich Frank's application for a visa was never processed, because the U.S. consulate in Amsterdam was destroyed in the German bombing on 14 May 1940, resulting in the loss of all the paperwork there, including Edith (n\u00e9e\u00a0Holl\u00e4nder) and Otto Heinrich Frank's visa application.[unreliable source?]After the summer holidays in 1941, [0] learned that [0] would no longer be allowed to go to the Opekta Works, a company that sold the fruit extract pectin, as Jewish children had to attend Jewish schools. From then on [0], like an older sister, Margot, went to the Jewish Lyceum\u00a0[nl], an exclusive Jewish secondary school in Amsterdam opened in September 1941.1929: [0]'s birthplace, the Hospital Maingau of the Red Cross, in 1929 still known as Vaterl\u00e4ndisches Krankenhaus (the hospital of the \"Patriotic Women's Association\") in Frankfurt-Nordend1929-1931: Stele in front of [0]'s home from 1929 to 1931 at Marbachweg 307 in Frankfurt-Dornbusch, where [0]'s parents moved from the Westend with an older sister, Margot in 19271931-1933: Ganghoferstra\u00dfe 24 in the Poets' Quarter of Frankfurt-Dornbusch, Edith (n\u00e9e\u00a0Holl\u00e4nder) and Otto Heinrich Frank's residence from 1931 to 19331933-1934: Pastorplatz 1 in Aachen, where Anne's maternal grandmother Rosa Holl\u00e4nder (n\u00e9e Stern) lived until 1939.

For [0]'s thirteenth birthday on 12 June 1942, [0] received an autograph book, bound with red-and-white checkered cloth and with a small lock on the front. [0] decided [0] would use an autograph book, bound with red-and-white checkered cloth and with a small lock on the front as a diary, and had named an autograph book, bound with red-and-white checkered cloth and with a small lock on the front Kitty. [0] began writing in an autograph book, bound with red-and-white checkered cloth and with a small lock on the front almost immediately. In [0]'s entry dated 20 June 1942, [0] lists many of the restrictions placed upon the lives of the Dutch Jewish population.In mid-1942, the systematic deportation of Jews from the Netherlands started. Otto and Edith Frank planned to go into hiding with the children on 16 July 1942, but when Margot received a call-up notice from the Zentralstelle f\u00fcr j\u00fcdische Auswanderung (Central Office for Jewish Emigration) on 5 July, ordering Margot to report for relocation to a work camp, Otto and Edith Frank were forced to move planned ten days forward. Shortly before going into hiding, [0] gave her friend and next-door neighbor Toosje Kupers a book, a tea set, and a tin of marbles. On 6 July, the Frank family left a note for the Kupers, asking the Kupers to take care of the Frank family's cat Moortje. As the Associated Press reports: \"'her friend and next-door neighbor Toosje Kupers'm worried about her friend and next-door neighbor Toosje Kupers's , because her friend and next-door neighbor Toosje Kupers'm scared my marbles might fall into the wrong hands,' her friend and next-door neighbor Toosje Kupers said [0] told her friend and next-door neighbor Toosje Kupers. 'Could her friend and next-door neighbor Toosje Kupers keep my marbles for her friend and next-door neighbor Toosje Kupers for a little while?'\"", "Life in the Achterhuis": "Anne Frank is our person to focus on. On the morning of Monday, 6 July 1942, [0] moved into [0]'s hiding place, a three-story space entered from a landing above the Opekta offices on the Prinsengracht, where some of Otto Frank's's most trusted employees would be [0]'s helpers. This hiding place became known as the Achterhuis (translated into \"Secret Annex\" in English editions of the diary). [0]'s was left in a state of disarray to create the impression that [0] had left suddenly, and Otto Frank's left a note that hinted [0] were going to Switzerland. The need for secrecy forced [0] to leave behind Anne Frank's cat, Moortje. As Jews were not allowed to use public transport, Otto Frank'swalked several kilometres from [0]'s . Margot cycled to the Prinsengracht with Miep Gies. The door to the Achterhuis was later covered by a bookcase to ensure The door to the Achterhuis remained undiscovered.Victor Kugler, Johannes Kleiman, Miep Gies, and Bep Voskuijl were the only employees who knew of [0]. Along with Miep Gies's husband Jan Gies and Bep Voskuijl's father Johannes Hendrik Voskuijl, Victor Kugler, Johannes Kleiman, Miep Gies, and Bep Voskuijl were the \"helpers\" for the duration of [0]'s confinement. The only connection between the outside world and the occupants of the house, Victor Kugler, Johannes Kleiman, Miep Gies, and Bep Voskuijl kept the occupants of the house informed of war news and political developments. Victor Kugler, Johannes Kleiman, Miep Gies, and Bep Voskuijl catered to all of the occupants of the house's needs, ensured the occupants of the house's safety, and supplied the occupants of the house with food, a task that grew more difficult with the passage of time. Anne Frank wrote of Victor Kugler, Johannes Kleiman, Miep Gies, and Bep Voskuijl's dedication and of Victor Kugler, Johannes Kleiman, Miep Gies, and Bep Voskuijl's efforts to boost morale within Their apartment during the most dangerous of times. Victor Kugler, Johannes Kleiman, Miep Gies, and Bep Voskuijl were aware that, if caught, Victor Kugler, Johannes Kleiman, Miep Gies, and Bep Voskuijl could face the death penalty for sheltering Jews.On 13 July 1942, [0] were joined by the Van Pels family, made up of Hermann, Auguste, and 16-year-old Peter, and then in November by Fritz Pfeffer, a dentist and friend of the family. Anne Frank wrote of Anne Frank's pleasure at having new people to talk to, but tensions quickly developed within the group forced to live in such confined conditions. After sharing Anne Frank's room with Fritz Pfeffer, a dentist and friend of the family, Anne Frank found Fritz Pfeffer, a dentist and friend of the family to be insufferable and resented Fritz Pfeffer, a dentist and friend of the family's intrusion, and Anne Frank clashed with Auguste van Pels, whom Anne Frank regarded as foolish. Anne Frank regarded Hermann van Pels and Fritz Pfeffer Fritz Pfeffer, a dentist and friend of the family as selfish, particularly in regard to the amount of food Hermann van Pels and Fritz Pfeffer consumed. Some time later, after first dismissing the shy and awkward Peter van Pels, Anne Frank recognized a kinship with the shy and awkward Peter van Pels and the two entered a romance. Anne Frank received Anne Frank's first kiss from the shy and awkward Peter van Pels, but Anne Frank's infatuation with the shy and awkward Peter van Pels began to wane as Anne Frank questioned whether Anne Frank's feelings for the shy and awkward Peter van Pels were genuine, or resulted from the two's shared confinement. Anne Frank formed a close bond with each of the helpers, and Otto Frank's later recalled that Anne Frank had anticipated the helpers's daily visits with impatient enthusiasm. Otto Frank's observed that Anne Frank's closest friendship was with Bep Voskuijl\u2026 the two of them the two of them often stood whispering in the corner.\"", "The young diarist": "[0] is our person to focus on. In her writing, [0] examined [0]'s relationships with the members of her family, and the strong differences in each of the members of her family's personalities. [0] was closest emotionally to [0]'s father, who later said, \"I got on better with [0] than with Margot, who was more attached to her mother. The reason for got may have been that Margot, who was more attached to her mother rarely showed Margot, who was more attached to her mother's feelings and didn't need as much support because Margot, who was more attached to her mother didn't suffer from mood swings as much as [0] did.\" The Frank sisters formed a closer relationship than had existed before The Frank sisters went into hiding, although [0] sometimes expressed jealousy towards Margot, who was more attached to her mother, particularly when members of her family criticized [0] for lacking Margot, who was more attached to her mother's gentle and placid nature. As [0] began to mature, The Frank sisters were able to confide in each other. In [0]'s entry of 12 January 1944, [0] wrote, \"Margot, who was more attached to her mother's much nicer\u2026 Margot, who was more attached to her mother's not nearly so catty these days and is becoming a real friend. Margot, who was more attached to her mother no longer thinks of [0] as a little baby who doesn't count.[0] frequently wrote of [0]'s difficult relationship with her mother, and of [0]'s ambivalence towards her mother. On 7 November 1942, [0] described [0]'s \"contempt\" for her mother and [0]'s inability to \"confront her mother with her mother's carelessness, her mother's sarcasm and her mother's hard-heartedness,\" before concluding, \"her mother's not a mother to [0].\" Later, as [0] revised her diary, [0] felt ashamed of [0]'s harsh attitude, writing: \"[0], is it really [0] who mentioned hate, oh [0], how could [0]?\" [0] came to understand that The Frank sisters's differences resulted from misunderstandings that were as much [0]'s fault as her mother's, and saw that [0] had added unnecessarily to her mother's suffering. With this realization, [0] began to treat her mother with a degree of tolerance and respect.The Frank sisters each hoped to return to school as soon as The Frank sisters were able, and continued with The Frank sisters's studies while in hiding. Margot, who was more attached to her mother took a course 'Elementary Latin' by correspondence in Bep Voskuijl's name and received high marks. Most of [0]'s time was spent reading and studying, and [0] regularly wrote and edited (after March 1944) [0]'s diary entries. In addition to providing a narrative of events as they occurredevents as they occurred , [0] wrote about [0]'s feelings, beliefs, dreams and ambitions, subjects [0] felt [0] could not discuss with anyone. As [0]'s confidence in her writing grew, and as [0] began to mature, [0] wrote of more abstract subjects such as [0]'s belief in God, and how [0] defined human nature.[0] aspired to become a journalist, writing in her diary on Wednesday, 5 April 1944: [0] finally realized that [0] must do [0]'s schoolwork to keep from being ignorant, to get on in life, to become a journalist, because become's what [0] want!

On the morning of 4 August 1944, the Achterhuis was stormed by a group of German uniformed police (Gr\u00fcne Polizei) led by SS-Oberscharf\u00fchrer Karl Silberbauer of the Sicherheitsdienst. [0] were taken to RSHA headquarters, where [0] were interrogated and held overnight. On 5 August, [0] were transferred to the Huis van Bewaring (House of Detention), an overcrowded prison on the Weteringschans\u00a0[nl]. Two days later [0] were transported to the Westerbork transit camp, through which more than 100,000 Jews, mostly Dutch and German, had passed. Having been arrested in hiding, [0] were considered criminals and sent to the Punishment Barracks for hard labour.Victor Kugler and Johannes Kleiman were arrested and jailed at the penal camp for enemies of the regime at Amersfoort, in the province of Utrecht. Johannes Kleiman was released after seven weeks, but Victor Kugler was held in various Dutch concentration and prison camps until the war's's end. Miep Gies was questioned and threatened by the Security Police but not detained. Bep Voskuijl managed to escape with a few documents that would have incriminated their black market contacts. During the following days, the two female secretaries returned to the Achterhuis and found Anne's papers strewn on the floor. the two female secretaries collected Anne's papers, as well as several family photograph albums, and Miep Gies resolved to return Anne's papers to Anne Frank after the war's. On 7 August 1944, Miep Gies attempted to facilitate the release of [0] by confronting SS-Oberscharf\u00fchrer Karl Silberbauer of the Sicherheitsdienst and offering SS-Oberscharf\u00fchrer Karl Silberbauer of the Sicherheitsdienst money to intervene, but SS-Oberscharf\u00fchrer Karl Silberbauer of the Sicherheitsdienst refused.", "Source of discovery": "Anne Frank is our person to focus on. In 2015, [0] wrote a biography in which [0] alleged that Bep's younger sister Nelly (1923\u20132001) could have betrayed Anne Frank. Bep's younger sister Nelly (1923\u20132001) was a Nazi collaborator from the age of 19 to 23. Bep's younger sister Nelly (1923\u20132001) had run away to Austria with a Nazi officer, and returned to Amsterdam in 1943 after the relationship ended. Bep's younger sister Nelly (1923\u20132001) had been critical of Bep and their father, Johannes Voskuijl, Bep and their father, Johannes Voskuijl,'s for helping Anne Frank; their father, Johannes Voskuijl was the one who constructed the bookcase covering the entrance to the hiding place and remained as an unofficial watchman of the hiding place. In one of their quarrels, Bep's younger sister Nelly (1923\u20132001) shouted to Bep and their father, Johannes Voskuijl,, \"Go to Bep and their father, Johannes Voskuijl,'s .\" Karl Josef Silberbauer, the SS officer who made the arrest, was reported to have said that the informer had \"the voice of a young woman\".[unreliable source?]In 2016, the Anne Frank House published new research pointing to an investigation over ration card fraud, rather than betrayal, as a possible explanation for the raid that led to the arrest. The report stated that other activities in the building may have led authorities there, including activities of Anne Frank's company; however, The report did not rule out betrayal.A 2018 book suggested Ans van Dijk, a Dutch Jew who betrayed at least 145 fellow Jews to the Gestapo, as a potential candidate for the informer. Dutch resistance fighter Gerard Kremer, who worked as a caretaker at an office building requisitioned by the Sicherheitsdienst, apparently witnessed Ans van Dijk, a Dutch Jew who betrayed at least 145 fellow Jews to the Gestapo, visiting an office building requisitioned by the Sicherheitsdienst in August 1944 and overheard Ans van Dijk, a Dutch Jew who betrayed at least 145 fellow Jews to the Gestapo, talking with Ans van Dijk, a Dutch Jew who betrayed at least 145 fellow Jews to the Gestapo,'s SS superiors about Prinsengracht, where the Franks were hiding. However, another book examining this possibility noted that many of Ans van Dijk, a Dutch Jew who betrayed at least 145 fellow Jews to the Gestapo,'s victims had lived in or near Prinsengracht, where the Franks were hiding.In January 2022, some investigators proposed Arnold van den Bergh, a member of Amsterdam's Jewish Council who died in 1950, as the suspected informant. some investigators postulated that Arnold van den Bergh, a member of Amsterdam's Jewish Council who died in 1950, gave up Anne Frank to save Anne Frank's family. The investigation is chronicled in Rosemary Sullivan's book, The Betrayal of Anne Frank: A Cold Case Investigation. Evidence was also claimed to have been found that Anne Frank's father later knew this but did not reveal this after the war. According to the BBC, these investigators \"spend six years using modern investigative techniques to crack the 'cold case\u2026'.\" However, according to The New York Times, several World War II and Holocaust scholars have doubted the methods and conclusion of The investigation, calling the evidence \"far too thin\".Shortly after the publication of Rosemary Sullivan's book, The Betrayal of Anne Frank: A Cold Case Investigation, after criticism from scholars Bart van der Boom, David Barnouw and Johannes Houwink ten Cate, publisher Ambo Anthos, via an internal email, apologized for the publication of the Dutch translation. publisher Ambo Anthos said publisher Ambo Anthos should have been more critical and announced that publisher Ambo Anthos are \"await(ing) the answers from the researchers to the questions that have emerged and are delaying the decision to print another run\". In response, Pieter van Twisk, one of the investigators used in the book, said that Pieter van Twisk, one of the investigators used in the book was \"perplexed by an internal email\" and that these investigators had never claimed to have uncovered the complete truth. In March 2022, a group of World War Two experts and historians published a group of World War Two experts and historians's analysis of the argumentation and use of historical sources in Rosemary Sullivan's book, The Betrayal of Anne Frank: A Cold Case Investigation, contending the central claim that the Amsterdam Jewish council even had a list of Jewish hiding places that Arnold van den Bergh, a member of Amsterdam's Jewish Council who died in 1950, could draw on, and concluding that the accusation of Arnold van den Bergh, a member of Amsterdam's Jewish Council who died in 1950, was based on weak assumptions and lack of historical knowledge. As a result, the Dutch translation was recalled by publisher Ambo Anthos.On 19 August 2022, the Dutch researcher Natasha Gerson published an 80-page report of an annotation check, which argued that the theory in A 2018 book was not only flawed but the product of source fraud. In Rosemary Sullivan's's , Otto Frank's's agenda, a letter Otto Frank's received from helper Johannes Kleiman and several statements were proven to be distorted to suit the outcome. Several negative claims about notary van der Bergh Arnold van den Bergh, a member of Amsterdam's Jewish Council who died in 1950, had Anton Schepers, a Nazi adversary who was diagnosed twice as insane and who had taken over Arnold van den Bergh, a member of Amsterdam's Jewish Council who died in 1950,'s practice, as the only source. Several negative claims about notary van der Bergh included the claim of Nazi contacts and a commission of 200,000 guilders paid on the sale of Goudstikker's art business. While A 2018 book said Arnold van den Bergh, a member of Amsterdam's Jewish Council who died in 1950, enjoyed the protection of two high-up Nazis, the CCT and Rosemary Sullivan's omitted statements that two high-up Nazis had not known Arnold van den Bergh, a member of Amsterdam's Jewish Council who died in 1950,. the Dutch translation was soon afterwards discontinued."}, "Deportation and life in captivity": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on.

Bloeme Evers-Emden, an Amsterdam native who had befriended Margot and Anne in the Jewish Lyceum\u00a0[nl] in 1941 saw [0], Margot, and Margot and Anne's regularly in the Auschwitz concentration camp, and was interviewed for Bloeme Evers-Emden, an Amsterdam native who had befriended Margot and Anne in the Jewish Lyceum\u00a0[nl] in 1941's remembrances of the group the Auschwitz concentration camp in the television documentary The Last Seven Months of [0] (1988) by Dutch filmmaker Willy Lindwer and the BBC documentary [0] Remembered (1995).Upon arrival at the Auschwitz concentration camp, the SS forcibly split the men from the women and children, and Otto Frank was separated from his family. Those deemed able to work were admitted into the Auschwitz concentration camp, and those deemed unfit for labour were immediately killed. Of the 1,019 passengers, 549\u2014including all children younger than 15\u2014were sent directly to the gas chambers. [0] was one of the youngest people spared from [0]'s transport.

Disease was rampant; before long, [0]'s skin became badly infected by scabies. the group were moved into an infirmary, which was in a state of constant darkness and infested with rats and mice. [0] stopped eating, saving every morsel of food for the group and passing [0]'s rations to the group through a hole [0] made at the bottom of the infirmary wall.In October 1944, the group were scheduled to join a transport to the Liebau labour camp in Lower Silesia. Bloeme Evers-Emden, an Amsterdam native who had befriended Margot and Anne in the Jewish Lyceum\u00a0[nl] in 1941 was scheduled to be on a transport to the Liebau labour camp in Lower Silesia, but [0] was prohibited from going because [0] had developed scabies, and the group opted to stay with [0]. Bloeme Evers-Emden, an Amsterdam native who had befriended Margot and Anne in the Jewish Lyceum\u00a0[nl] in 1941 went on without the group.On 28 October, selections began for women to be relocated to Bergen-Belsen. More than 8,000 women, including the group, and Auguste van Pels, were transported. [0] was left behind and died of disease and starvation. Tents were erected at Bergen-Belsen to accommodate the influx of prisoners, and as the population rose, the death toll due to disease increased rapidly.[0] was briefly reunited with two friends, Hanneli Goslar and Nanette Blitz, who were also confined in the camp. Nanette Blitz had been moved from the Sternlager to the same section of the Auschwitz concentration camp as [0] on 5 December 1944, while Nanette Blitz had been held in the Sternlager since February 1944. two friends, Hanneli Goslar and Nanette Blitz, who were also confined in the camp survived the war, and later discussed the conversations two friends, Hanneli Goslar and Nanette Blitz, who were also confined in the camp had with [0], Nanette Blitz in person and Nanette Blitz through a barbed wire fence. Nanette Blitz described [0] as bald, emaciated, and shivering, remarking: \"[The] shock of seeing [0] in this emaciated state was indescribable.\" [0] told Nanette Blitz that [0] hoped to write a book based on the diary when the war ended. Nanette Blitz noted Auguste van Pels was with the group, and was caring for Margot. Nanette Blitz also recalled Nanette Blitz did not see Margot, as Margot was too weak to leave Margot's bunk, while Nanette Blitz stated Nanette Blitz met with the group. [0] told two friends, Hanneli Goslar and Nanette Blitz, who were also confined in the camp [0] believed [0]'s parents were dead, and for that reason [0] did not wish to live any longer. Nanette Blitz later estimated their meetings had taken place in late January or early February 1945."}, "Death": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] died at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in February or March 1945. The specific cause is unknown; however, there is evidence to suggest that [0] died from a typhus epidemic that spread through the camp, killing 17,000 prisoners. Gena Turgel, a survivor of Bergen-Belsen, knew [0] at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. In 2015, Gena Turgel, a survivor of Bergen-Belsen told the British newspaper The Sun: \"[0]'s bed was around the corner from Gena Turgel, a survivor of Bergen-Belsen. [0] was delirious, terrible, burning up.\" Gena Turgel, a survivor of Bergen-Belsen said Gena Turgel, a survivor of Bergen-Belsen had brought [0] water to wash. Gena Turgel, a survivor of Bergen-Belsen said that a typhus epidemic that spread through the camp, killing 17,000 prisoners took a terrible toll on the inmates: \"the inmates were dying like flies\u2014in the hundreds. Reports used to come in\u2014500 people who died. Three hundred? We said, 'Thank God, only 300.'\" Other diseases, including typhoid fever, were rampant.Witnesses later testified Margot fell from Margot's bunk in Margot's weakened state and was killed by the shock. [0] died a day after Margot. The dates of Margot's and Anne's deaths were not recorded. It was long thought that Margot's and Anne's deaths occurred only a few weeks before British troops liberated the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp on 15 April 1945, but research in 2015 indicated that Margot's and Anne's may have died as early as February. Among other evidence, witnesses recalled that Margot's and Anne's displayed typhus symptoms by 7 February, and Dutch health authorities reported that most untreated typhus victims died within 12 days of most untreated typhus victims's first symptoms. Additionally, Hanneli Goslar stated her father, Hans Goslar\u00a0[de], died one or two weeks after Margot's and Anne's's first meeting;[better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] her father, Hans Goslar\u00a0[de] died on 25 February 1945. After the war, it was estimated that only 5,000 of the 107,000 Jews deported from the Netherlands between 1942 and 1944 survived. An estimated 30,000 Jews remained in the Netherlands, with many people aided by the Dutch underground. Approximately two thirds of An estimated 30,000 Jews survived the war.Otto Frank survived Otto Frank's internment in Auschwitz. After the war ended, Otto Frank returned to Amsterdam in June 1945 where Otto Frank was sheltered by Jan and Miep Gies as Otto Frank attempted to locate Otto Frank's family. Otto Frank learned of the death of his wife, Edith, during Otto Frank's journey to Amsterdam, but remained hopeful that Margot's and Anne's had survived. After several weeks, Otto Frank discovered Margot's and Anne's deaths had also died. Otto Frank attempted to determine the fates of Margot's and Anne's's friends and learned many had been murdered. Sanne Ledermann, often mentioned in Anne's diary, had been gassed along with Sanne Ledermann, often mentioned in Anne's diary,'s parents; Sanne Ledermann, often mentioned in Anne's diary,'s sister, Barbara Ledermann, a close friend of Margot's, had survived. Several of Margot's and Anne's's school friends had survived, as had the extended families of Otto and Edith Frank, as the extended families of Otto and Edith Frank had fled Germany during the mid-1930s, with individual family members settling in Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States."}, "The Diary of a Young Girl": {"Publication": "Anne Frank is our person to focus on. In July 1945, after the sisters Janny and Lien Brilleslijper, who were with [0] in Bergen-Belsen, confirmed the deaths of [0], Miep Gies gave Otto Frank Anne's notebooks (including the red-and-white checkered diary) and a bundle of loose notes that Miep Gies and Bep Voskuijl had saved in the hope of returning Anne's notebooks (including the red-and-white checkered diary) to Anne Frank. Otto Frank later commented that Otto Frank had not realized Anne Frank had kept such an accurate and well-written record of [0]'s time in hiding. In Otto Frank's memoir, Otto Frank described the painful process of reading the red-and-white checkered diary, recognizing the events described and recalling that Otto Frank had already heard some of the more amusing episodes read aloud by Otto Frank's . Otto Frank saw for the first time the more private side of Otto Frank's and those sections of the red-and-white checkered diary Anne Frank had not discussed with anyone, noting, \"For Otto Frank it was a revelation\u2026 Otto Frank had no idea of the depth of her thoughts and feelings\u2026 Anne Frank had kept her thoughts and feelings to Anne Frank\". Moved by Anne Frank's repeated wish to be an author, Otto Frank began to consider having the red-and-white checkered diary published.the red-and-white checkered diary began as a private expression of Anne Frank's thoughts; Anne Frank wrote several times that Anne Frank would never allow anyone to read the red-and-white checkered diary. Anne Frank candidly described Anne Frank's life, her family and companions, and her family and companions's situation, while beginning to recognize Anne Frank's ambition to write fiction for publication. In March 1944, Anne Frank heard a radio broadcast by Gerrit Bolkestein\u2014a member of the Dutch government in exile, based in London\u2014who said that when the war ended, he would create a public record of the Dutch people's oppression under German occupation. he mentioned the publication of letters and diaries, and Anne Frank decided to submit Anne Frank's work when the time came. Anne Frank began editing Anne Frank's writing, removing some sections and rewriting others, with a view to publication. the red-and-white checkered diary was supplemented by additional notebooks and loose-leaf sheets of paper. Anne Frank created pseudonyms for the members of the household and the helpers. The Van Pels family became Hermann, Petronella, and Peter van Daan, and Fritz Pfeffer became Albert D\u00fcssell. In this edited version, Anne Frank addressed each entry to \"Kitty,\" a fictional character in Cissy van Marxveldt's Joop ter Heul novels that Anne Frank enjoyed reading. Anne Frank used the red-and-white checkered diary, and Anne Frank's edited version, known as \"version B\", to produce the first version for publication. Although Anne Frank restored the true identities of Anne Frank's own family, Anne Frank retained all of the other pseudonyms.Anne Frank gave the red-and-white checkered diary to the historian Annie Romein-Verschoor, who tried unsuccessfully to have it published. the historian Annie Romein-Verschoor, who tried unsuccessfully to have it published then gave the red-and-white checkered diary to her husband Jan Romein, who wrote an article about it, titled \"Kinderstem\" (\"A Child's Voice\"), which was published in the newspaper Het Parool on 3 April 1946. her husband Jan Romein, who wrote an article about it, titled \"Kinderstem\" (\"A Child's Voice\") wrote that the red-and-white checkered diary \"stammered out in a child's voice, embodies all the hideousness of fascism, more so than all the evidence at Nuremberg put together.\" her husband Jan Romein, who wrote an article about it, titled \"Kinderstem\" (\"A Child's Voice\")'s attracted attention from publishers, and the red-and-white checkered diary was published in the Netherlands as Het Achterhuis (The Annex) (literally, \"the back house\") in 1947, followed by five more printings by 1950.It was first published in Germany and France in 1950, and after being rejected by several publishers, was first published in the United Kingdom in 1952. The first American edition, published in 1952 under the title Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl, was positively reviewed. the red-and-white checkered diary was successful in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, but in the United Kingdom the red-and-white checkered diary failed to attract an audience and by 1953 was out of print. the red-and-white checkered diary's most noteworthy success was in Japan, where it received critical acclaim and sold more than 100,000 copies in its first edition. In Japan, where it received critical acclaim and sold more than 100,000 copies in its first edition, Anne Frank quickly was identified as an important cultural figure who represented the destruction of youth during the war.A play by Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett based upon the diary premiered in New York City on 5 October 1955, and later won a Pulitzer Prize for Drama. A play by Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett based upon the diary was followed by the film The Diary of Anne Frank (1959), which was a critical and commercial success. Biographer Melissa M\u00fcller later wrote that the dramatization had \"contributed greatly to the romanticizing, sentimentalizing and universalizing of Anne Frank's story.\" Over the years the popularity of the red-and-white checkered diary grew, and in many schools, particularly in the United Kingdom, the red-and-white checkered diary was included as part of the curriculum, introducing Anne Frank to new generations of readers.", "Reception": "Anne Frank is our person to focus on. [0] has been praised for [0]'s literary merits. Commenting on Anne Frank's writing style, the dramatist Meyer Levin commended Anne Frank for \"sustaining the tension of a well-constructed novel\", and was so impressed by the quality of Anne Frank's work that the dramatist Meyer Levin collaborated with Otto Frank on a dramatization of [0] shortly after [0]'s publication. the dramatist Meyer Levin became obsessed with Anne Frank, which the dramatist Meyer Levin wrote about in the dramatist Meyer Levin's autobiography The Obsession. The poet John Berryman called [0] a unique depiction, not merely of adolescence but of the \"conversion of a child into a person as it is happening in a precise, confident, economical style stunning in its honesty\"the \"conversion of a child into a person as it is happening in a precise, confident, economical style stunning in its honesty\" .In her's introduction to [0]'s first American edition, her described [0] as \"one of the wisest and most moving commentaries on war and war's impact on human beings that her have ever read.\" John F. Kennedy discussed Anne Frank in a 1961 speech, and said, \"Of all the multitudes who throughout history have spoken for human dignity in times of great suffering and loss, no voice is more compelling than that of Anne Frank.\" In 1961, the Soviet writer Ilya Ehrenburg wrote of Anne Frank: \"one voice speaks for six million\u2014one voice.\"As Anne Frank's stature as both a writer and humanist has grown, Anne Frank has been discussed specifically as a symbol of the Holocaust and more broadly as a representative of persecution. Hillary Clinton, in Hillary Clinton's acceptance speech for an Elie Wiesel Humanitarian Award in 1994, read from Anne Frank's and spoke of Anne Frank \"awakening us to the folly of indifference and the terrible toll indifference takes on our young,\" which Hillary Clinton related to contemporary events in Sarajevo, Somalia and Rwanda. After receiving a humanitarian award from the Anne Frank Foundation in 1994, Nelson Mandela addressed a crowd in Johannesburg, saying Nelson Mandela had read Anne Frank's while in prison and \"derived much encouragement from [0].\" Nelson Mandela likened Anne Frank's struggle against Nazism to Nelson Mandela's struggle against apartheid, drawing a parallel between the two philosophies: \"Because these beliefs are patently false, and because the two philosophies were, and will always be, challenged by the likes of Anne Frank, the two philosophies are bound to fail.\" Also in 1994, V\u00e1clav Havel said \"Anne Frank's legacy is very much alive and Anne Frank's legacy can address us fully\" in relation to the political and social changes occurring at the time in former Eastern Bloc countries.Primo Levi suggested Anne Frank is frequently identified as a single representative of the millions of people who suffered and died as she did because \"Anne Frank moves us more than the countless others who suffered just as Anne Frank did but whose faces have remained in the shadows. Perhaps it is better that way; if we were capable of taking in all the suffering of the millions of people who suffered and died as she did, we would not be able to live.\" In her's closing message in M\u00fcller's biography of Anne Frank, her expressed a similar thought, though her attempted to dispel what her felt was a growing misconception that \"Anne Frank symbolizes the six million victims of the Holocaust\", writing: \"Anne Frank's life and death were Anne Frank's own individual fate, an individual fate that happened six million times over. Anne Frank cannot, and should not, stand for the many individuals whom the Nazis robbed of their livesthe many individuals whom the Nazis robbed of their lives's \u2026 But Anne Frank's fate helps us grasp the immense loss the world suffered because of the Holocaust.Otto Frank spent the remainder of Otto Frank's life as custodian of Anne Frank's legacy, saying, \"It's a strange role. In the normal family relationship, it is the child of the famous parent who has the honour and the burden of continuing the task. In Otto Frank's case the role is reversed.\" Otto Frank recalled his publisher's's explaining why his publisher's thought [0] has been so widely read, with the comment, \"his publisher's said that [0] encompasses so many areas of life that each reader can find something that moves each reader personally\". Simon Wiesenthal expressed a similar sentiment when Simon Wiesenthal said that [0] had raised more widespread awareness of the Holocaust than had been achieved during the Nuremberg Trials, because \"people identified with Anne Frank. This was the impact of the Holocaust, this was a family like Simon Wiesenthal's family, like your family and so you could understand this.\"In June 1999, Time magazine published a special edition titled \"Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century\". Anne Frank was selected as one of the \"Heroes & Icons\", and the writer, Roger Rosenblatt, described Anne Frank's legacy with the comment, \"The passions [0] ignites suggest that everyone owns Anne Frank, that Anne Frank has risen above the Holocaust, Judaism, girlhood and even goodness and become a totemic figure of the modern world\u2014the moral individual mind beset by the machinery of destruction, insisting on the right to live and question and hope for the future of human beings.\" the writer, Roger Rosenblatt notes that while Anne Frank's courage and pragmatism are admired, Anne Frank's ability to analyse Anne Frank and the quality of her writing are the key components of Anne Frank's appeal. the writer, Roger Rosenblatt writes, \"The reason for Anne Frank's immortality was basically literary. Anne Frank was an extraordinarily good writer, for any age, and the quality of her writing seemed a direct result of a ruthlessly honest disposition.\"", "Denials of authenticity and legal action": "Anne Frank is our person to focus on. After [0] became widely known in the late 1950s, various allegations against the veracity of [0] and/or [0]'s contents appeared, with the earliest published criticisms occurring in Sweden and Norway. In 1957, Fria ord (\"Free Words\"), the magazine of the Swedish neofascist organization National League of Sweden, published an article by Danish author and critic Harald Nielsen, who had previously written antisemitic articles about the Danish-Jewish author Georg Brandes.

Simon Wiesenthal indeed began searching for the man who had arrested her and found the man who had arrested her in 1963. When interviewed, the man who had arrested her admitted the man who had arrested her's role, and identified Anne Frank from a photograph as one of the people arrested. the man who had arrested her provided a full account of events, even recalling emptying a briefcase full of papers onto the floor. the man who had arrested her's corroborated the version of events that had previously been presented by witnesses such as Otto Frank.In 1959, Otto Frank took legal action in L\u00fcbeck against Lothar Stielau, a school teacher and former Hitler Youth member who published a school paper that described the diary as \"a forgery\". The complaint was extended to include Heinrich Buddegerg, who wrote a letter in support of Lothar Stielau, a school teacher and former Hitler Youth member who published a school paper that described the diary as \"a forgery\", which was published in a L\u00fcbeck newspaper. The court examined [0] in 1960 and authenticated the handwriting as matching that in letters known to have been written by Anne Frank. The court declared [0] to be genuine. Lothar Stielau, a school teacher and former Hitler Youth member who published a school paper that described the diary as \"a forgery\" recanted Lothar Stielau, a school teacher and former Hitler Youth member who published a school paper that described the diary as \"a forgery\"'s earlier statement, and Otto Frank did not pursue the case any further.In 1976, Otto Frank took action against Heinz Roth of Frankfurt, who published pamphlets stating that the diary was \"a forgery\". The judge ruled that if Heinz Roth of Frankfurt, who published pamphlets stating that the diary was \"a forgery\" were to publish any further statements Heinz Roth of Frankfurt, who published pamphlets stating that the diary was \"a forgery\" would be subjected to a fine of 500,000 German marks and a six-month jail sentence. Heinz Roth of Frankfurt, who published pamphlets stating that the diary was \"a forgery\" appealed against The court's decision. Heinz Roth of Frankfurt, who published pamphlets stating that the diary was \"a forgery\" died in 1978, and after a year Heinz Roth of Frankfurt, who published pamphlets stating that the diary was \"a forgery\"'s was rejected.Otto Frank mounted a lawsuit in 1976 against Ernst R\u00f6mer, who distributed a pamphlet titled \"The Diary of Anne Frank, Bestseller, A Lie\". When a man named Edgar Geiss distributed a pamphlet titled \"The Diary of Anne Frank, Bestseller, A Lie\" in the courtroom, he too was prosecuted. Ernst R\u00f6mer, who distributed a pamphlet titled \"The Diary of Anne Frank, Bestseller, A Lie\" was fined 1,500 Deutschmarks, and a man named Edgar Geiss was sentenced to six months' imprisonment. The sentence of a man named Edgar Geiss was reduced on appeal, and the case was eventually dropped following a subsequent appeal because the time limit for filing a libel case had expired.With Otto Frank's death in 1980, the original diary, including letters and loose sheets, was willed to the Dutch Institute for War Documentation, which commissioned a forensic study of the diary through the Netherlands Ministry of Justice in 1986. the Dutch Institute for War Documentation, which commissioned a forensic study of the diary through the Netherlands Ministry of Justice in 1986 examined the handwriting against known examples and found that the handwriting matched. the Dutch Institute for War Documentation, which commissioned a forensic study of the diary through the Netherlands Ministry of Justice in 1986 determined that the paper, glue, and ink were readily available during the time [0] was said to have been written. the Dutch Institute for War Documentation, which commissioned a forensic study of the diary through the Netherlands Ministry of Justice in 1986 concluded that [0] is authentic, and the Dutch Institute for War Documentation, which commissioned a forensic study of the diary through the Netherlands Ministry of Justice in 1986's findings were published in what has become known as the \"Critical Edition\" of [0].

Purported evidence, as before, included several contradictions in [0], that the prose style and handwriting were not those of a teenager, and that hiding in the Achterhuis would have been impossible. In 1993, the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam and the Anne Frank Fonds in Basel filed a civil lawsuit to prohibit further distribution of Holocaust deniers Robert Faurisson and Siegfried Verbeke's booklet in the Netherlands. In 1998, the Amsterdam District Court ruled in favour of the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam and the Anne Frank Fonds in Basel, forbade any further denial of the authenticity of [0] and unsolicited distribution of publications to that effect, and imposed a penalty of 25,000 guilders per infringement.", "Censored sections": "[0] is our person to focus on.
