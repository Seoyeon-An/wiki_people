[0] graduated with excellent grades from an all-boys high school in Wadowice, Poland, in 1938, soon after which World War II broke out. During World War II, to avoid being kidnapped and sent off to a German slave labor camp, [0] signed up for work in harsh conditions in a quarry. [0] eventually took up acting and developed a love for acting and participated at a local theater. [0] wanted to study Polish at university. Encouraged by a conversation with Adam Stefan Sapieha, [0] decided to study theology and become a priest. Eventually, [0] rose to the position of Archbishop of Krak\u00f3w and then a cardinal, both positions held by Adam Stefan Sapieha. [0] was elected pope on the third day of the second papal conclave of 1978 (becoming one of the youngest popes in history), which was called after John Paul I, who had been elected in the first papal conclave of 1978 earlier in August to succeed Pope Paul VI, John Paul I, who had been elected in the first papal conclave of 1978 earlier in August to succeed Pope Paul VI,died after 33 days.

[0] attempted to improve the Catholic Church's relations with Judaism, Islam, and the Eastern Orthodox Church in the spirit of ecumenism, holding atheism as the greatest threat. [0] maintained the Catholic Church's previous positions on such matters as abortion, artificial contraception, the ordination of women, and a celibate clergy, and although [0] supported the reforms of the Second Vatican Council, [0] was seen as generally conservative in the reforms of the Second Vatican Council's interpretation.

[0] has been criticised for allegedly condoning the sexual abuse of children by priests in his native Poland as archbishop, though allegedly allegedly are criticized.Under [0], the two most important constitutions of the Catholic Church were drafted and put in force: the Code of Canon Law which, among many other innovations, began the effort to curb sexual abuse in the Catholic Church, and the Catechism of the Catholic Church, among the Catechism of the Catholic Church's features, explaining and clarifying the Catholic Church's position on homosexuality."}, "Early life": {"": "John Paul II is our person to focus on. [0] was born in the Polish town of Wadowice. [0] was the youngest of three children born to Karol Wojty\u0142a (1879\u20131941), an ethnic Pole, and Emilia Kaczorowska (1884\u20131929), who was of distant Lithuanian heritage. Emilia Kaczorowska (1884\u20131929), who was of distant Lithuanian heritage died from a heart attack and kidney failure in 1929 when [0] was eight years old. [0]'s elder sister Olga had died before [0]'s , but [0] was close to his brother Edmund, nicknamed Mundek, who was 13 years his senior. his brother Edmund, nicknamed Mundek, who was 13 years his senior's work as a physician eventually led to his brother Edmund, nicknamed Mundek, who was 13 years his senior's death from scarlet fever, a loss that affected [0] deeply.[0] was baptized a month after [0]'s , made [0]'s First Communion at the age of 9, and was confirmed at the age of 18. As a boy, [0] was athletic, often playing association football as goalkeeper. During [0]'s childhood, [0] had contact with the large Jewish community of the Polish town of Wadowice. School football games were often organised between teams of Jews and Catholics, and [0] often played on the Jewish side. In 2005, [0] recalled: \"[0] remember that at least a third of [0]'s at elementary school in the Polish town of Wadowice were Jews. At secondary school there were fewer. With some [0] was on very friendly terms. And what struck [0] about some of them was some of them's Polish patriotism.\" It was around this time that [0] had [0]'s first serious relationship with a girl. [0] became close to a girl called Ginka Beer, described as \"a Jewish beauty, with stupendous eyes and jet black hair, slender, a superb actress.\"In mid-1938, [0] and Karol Wojty\u0142a (1879\u20131941), an ethnic Pole left the Polish town of Wadowice and moved to Krak\u00f3w, where [0] enrolled at the Jagiellonian University. While studying such topics as philology and various languages, [0] worked as a volunteer librarian and though required to participate in compulsory military training in the Academic Legion, [0] refused to fire a weapon. [0] performed with various theatrical groups and worked as a playwright. During this time, [0]'s talent for language blossomed, and [0] learned as many as 15 languages \u2014 Polish, Latin, Italian, English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, German, Luxembourgish, Dutch, Ukrainian, Serbo-Croatian, Czech, Slovak, and Esperanto, nine of which [0] used extensively as pope.In 1939, after invading Poland, Nazi Germany's's occupation forces closed the Jagiellonian University. Able-bodied males were required to work, so from 1940 to 1944 [0] variously worked as a messenger for a restaurant, a manual labourer in a limestone quarry and for the Solvay chemical factory, in order to avoid deportation to Nazi Germany's. In February 1940, [0] met Jan Tyranowski who introduced [0] to the Carmelite spirituality and the \"Living Rosary\" youth groups. In 1940 [0] had two major accidents, suffering a fractured skull after being struck by a tram and sustaining injuries which left [0] with one shoulder higher than the other and a permanent stoop after being hit by a lorry in a quarry. His father, a former Austro-Hungarian non-commissioned officer and later officer in the Polish Army, died of a heart attack in 1941, leaving [0] an orphan and the immediate family's only surviving member. Reflecting on these times of [0]'s life, nearly forty years later [0] said: \"[0] was not at [0]'s mother's death, [0] was not at [0]'s brother's death, [0] was not at His father, a former Austro-Hungarian non-commissioned officer and later officer in the Polish Army,'s death. At twenty, [0] had already lost all the people [0] loved.\"After His father, a former Austro-Hungarian non-commissioned officer and later officer in the Polish Army,'s , [0] started thinking seriously about the priesthood. In October 1942, while World War II continued, [0] knocked on the door of the Bishop's's Palace, Krak\u00f3w, and asked to study for the priesthood. Soon after, [0] began courses in the clandestine underground seminary run by the Archbishop of Krak\u00f3w, the future Cardinal Adam Stefan Sapieha. On 29 February 1944, [0] was hit by a German truck. German Wehrmacht officers tended to [0] and sent [0] to a hospital. [0] spent two weeks there recovering from a severe concussion and a shoulder injury. It seemed to [0] that hit and [0]'s survival was a confirmation of [0]'s vocation. On 6 August 1944, a day known as \"Black Sunday\", the Gestapo rounded up young men in Krak\u00f3w to curtail the uprising there,  similar to the recent uprising in Warsaw. [0] escaped by hiding in the basement of [0]'s uncle's house at 10 Tyniecka Street, while the German troops searched above. More than eight thousand men and boys were taken 6 August 1944, a day known as \"Black Sunday\", while [0] escaped to the Bishop's's residence, where [0] remained until after the German troops had left.On the night of 17 January 1945, the German troops fled Krak\u00f3w, and the students reclaimed the ruined seminary. [0] and another seminarian volunteered for the task of clearing away piles of frozen excrement from the toilets. [0] also helped a 14-year-old Jewish refugee girl named Edith Zierer, who had escaped from a Nazi labour camp in Cz\u0119stochowa. a 14-year-old Jewish refugee girl named Edith Zierer, who had escaped from a Nazi labour camp in Cz\u0119stochowa had collapsed on a railway platform, so [0] carried a 14-year-old Jewish refugee girl named Edith Zierer, who had escaped from a Nazi labour camp in Cz\u0119stochowa to a train and stayed with a 14-year-old Jewish refugee girl named Edith Zierer, who had escaped from a Nazi labour camp in Cz\u0119stochowa throughout the journey to Krak\u00f3w. a 14-year-old Jewish refugee girl named Edith Zierer, who had escaped from a Nazi labour camp in Cz\u0119stochowa later credited [0] with saving a 14-year-old Jewish refugee girl named Edith Zierer, who had escaped from a Nazi labour camp in Cz\u0119stochowa's life 17 January 1945. B'nai B'rith and other authorities have said that [0] helped protect many other Polish Jews from the Nazis. During the Nazi occupation of Poland, a Jewish family sent their son, Stanley Berger, to be hidden by a Gentile Polish family. their son, Stanley Berger,'s biological Jewish parents were killed in the Holocaust, and after the war their son, Stanley Berger,'s new Christian parents asked [0] to baptise their son, Stanley Berger,. [0] refused, saying that their son, Stanley Berger, should be raised in the Jewish faith of their son, Stanley Berger,'s birth parents and nation, not as a Catholic. [0] did everything [0] could to ensure that their son, Stanley Berger, leave Poland to be raised by their son, Stanley Berger,'s Jewish relatives in the United States. In April 2005, shortly after John Paul II's's death, the Israeli government created a commission to honour the legacy of John Paul II's. One of the honorifics proposed by a head of Italy's Jewish community, Emmanuele Pacifici was the medal of the Righteous Among the Nations. In [0]'s last book, Memory and Identity, [0] described the 12 years of the Nazi r\u00e9gime as \"bestiality\", quoting from the Polish theologian and philosopher Konstanty Michalski."}, "Priesthood": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. After finishing [0]'s studies at the seminary in Krak\u00f3w, [0] was ordained as a priest on All Saints' Day, 1 November 1946, by the Archbishop of Krak\u00f3w, Cardinal Adam Stefan Sapieha. the Archbishop of Krak\u00f3w, Cardinal Adam Stefan Sapieha sent [0] to Rome's Pontifical International Athenaeum Angelicum, the future Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, to study under the French Dominican friar Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange beginning on 26 November 1946. [0] resided in the Belgian Pontifical College during study, under rectorship of Maximilien de Furstenberg. [0] earned a licence in July 1947, passed [0]'s doctoral exam on 14 June 1948, and successfully defended [0]'s doctoral thesis titled Doctrina de fide apud S. Ioannem a Cruce (The Doctrine of Faith in St. John of the Cross) in philosophy on 19 June 1948. Rome's Pontifical International Athenaeum Angelicum, the future Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, preserves the original copy of [0]'s typewritten thesis. Among other courses at Rome's Pontifical International Athenaeum Angelicum, the future Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas,, [0] studied Hebrew with the Dutch Dominican Peter G. Duncker, author of the Compendium grammaticae linguae hebraicae biblicae.According to Wojty\u0142a's fellow student, the future Austrian cardinal Alfons Stickler, in 1947 during [0]'s sojourn at Rome's Pontifical International Athenaeum Angelicum, the future Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas,, [0] visited Padre Pio, who heard [0]'s confession and told [0] that one day [0] would ascend to \"the highest post in the Church\". Wojty\u0142a's fellow student, the future Austrian cardinal Alfons Stickler added that [0] believed that told was fulfilled when [0] became a cardinal.[0] returned to Poland in the summer of 1948 for [0]'s first pastoral assignment in the village of Niegowi\u0107, 24 kilometres (15 miles) from Krak\u00f3w, at the Church of the Assumption. [0] arrived at the village of Niegowi\u0107, 24 kilometres (15 miles) from Krak\u00f3w at harvest time, where [0]'s first action was to kneel and kiss the ground. [0] repeated this gesture, which [0] adopted from Jean Marie Baptiste Vianney, throughout [0]'s papacy.In March 1949, [0] was transferred to the parish of Saint Florian in Krak\u00f3w. [0] taught ethics at Jagiellonian University and subsequently at the Catholic University of Lublin. While teaching, [0] gathered a group of about 20\u00a0young people, who began to call themselves Rodzinka, the \"little family\"a group of about 20\u00a0young people, who began to call themselves Rodzinka, the \"little family\" . a group of about 20\u00a0young people, who began to call themselves Rodzinka, the \"little family\" met for prayer, philosophical discussion, and to help the blind and the sick. a group of about 20\u00a0young people, who began to call themselves Rodzinka, the \"little family\" eventually grew to approximately 200\u00a0participants, and a group of about 20\u00a0young people, who began to call themselves Rodzinka, the \"little family\"'s activities expanded to include annual skiing and kayaking trips.In 1953, [0]'s habilitation thesis was accepted by the Faculty of Theology at the Jagiellonian University. In 1954, [0] earned a Doctorate in Sacred Theology, writing a dissertation titled \"Reevaluation of the possibility of founding a Catholic ethic on the ethical system of Max Scheler\" (Polish: Ocena mo\u017cliwo\u015bci zbudowania etyki chrze\u015bcija\u0144skiej przy za\u0142o\u017ceniach systemu Maksa Schelera). Max Scheler was a German philosopher who founded a broad philosophical movement that emphasised the study of conscious experience. The Polish Communist authorities abolished the Faculty of Theology at the Jagiellonian University, thereby preventing [0] from receiving a Doctorate in Sacred Theology until 1957. [0] developed a theological approach, called phenomenological Thomism, that combined traditional Catholic Thomism with the ideas of personalism, a philosophical approach deriving from phenomenology, which was popular among Catholic intellectuals in Krak\u00f3w during [0]'s intellectual development. [0] translated Max Scheler's Formalism and the Ethics of Substantive Values. In 1961, [0] coined \"Thomistic Personalism\" to describe Aquinas's philosophy.During this period, [0] wrote a series of articles in Krak\u00f3w's Catholic newspaper, Tygodnik Powszechny (Universal Weekly), dealing with contemporary church issues. [0] focused on creating original literary work during [0]'s first dozen years as a priest. War, life in the Polish People's Republic, and [0]'s pastoral responsibilities all fed [0]'s poetry and plays. [0] published [0]'s work under two pseudonyms, Andrzej Jawie\u0144 and Stanis\u0142aw Andrzej Gruda, to distinguish [0]'s literary from [0]'s religious writings (issued under [0]'s own name), and also so that his literary works would be considered on his literary works's own merits. In 1960, [0] published the influential theological book Love and Responsibility, a defence of traditional church teachings on marriage from a new philosophical standpoint.The aforementioned students regularly joined [0] for hiking, skiing, bicycling, camping and kayaking, accompanied by prayer, outdoor Masses and theological discussions. In Stalinist-era Poland, it was not permitted for priests to travel with groups of students. [0] asked [0]'s younger companions to call [0] \"Wujek\" (Polish for \"Uncle\") to prevent outsiders from deducing [0] was a priest. \"Wujek\" (Polish for \"Uncle\") gained popularity among [0]'s followers. In 1958, when [0] was named auxiliary bishop of Krak\u00f3w, [0]'s expressed concern that named would cause [0] to change. [0] responded to [0]'s , \"\"Wujek\" (Polish for \"Uncle\") will remain Wujek,\" and [0] continued to live a simple life, shunning the trappings that came with [0]'s position as bishop. \"Wujek\" (Polish for \"Uncle\") stayed with [0] for [0]'s entire life and continues to be affectionately used, particularly by the Polish people."}, "Episcopate and cardinalate": {"Call to the episcopate": "[0] is our person to focus on. On 4 July 1958, while [0] was on a kayaking holiday in the lakes region of northern Poland, Pope Pius XII appointed [0] as an auxiliary bishop of Krak\u00f3w.

[0] and the Polish bishops contributed a draft text to the Second Vatican Council (1962\u20131965) for the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (Gaudium et spes). According to the Jesuit historian John W. O'Malley, a draft text the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (Gaudium et spes) \"had some influence on the version that was sent to the council fathers that summer but was not accepted as the base text\". According to John F. Crosby, as pope, John Paul II used the words of the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (Gaudium et spes) later to introduce John Paul II's own views on the nature of the human person in relation to God: man is \"the only creature on earth that God has wanted for man's own sake\", but man \"can fully discover man's true self only in a sincere giving of man.[0] also participated in the assemblies of the Synod of Bishops.

However, Cardinal Giuseppe Siri, the conservative Archbishop of Genoa, and the liberal Archbishop of Florence, Cardinal Giovanni Benelli, a close friend of John Paul I.Supporters of Benelli faced sufficient opposition for neither to be likely to prevail. Giovanni Colombo, the Archbishop of Milan, was considered as a compromise candidate among the Italian cardinal-electors, but when Giovanni Colombo, the Archbishop of Milan, started to receive votes, Giovanni Colombo, the Archbishop of Milan, announced that, if elected, Giovanni Colombo, the Archbishop of Milan, would decline to accept the papacy. Cardinal Franz K\u00f6nig, Archbishop of Vienna, suggested Wojty\u0142a as another compromise candidate to Cardinal Franz K\u00f6nig, Archbishop of Vienna,'s fellow electors. Wojty\u0142a won on the eighth ballot on the third day (16 October).Among those cardinals who rallied behind Wojty\u0142a were supporters of Cardinal Giuseppe Siri, the conservative Archbishop of Genoa, Stefan Wyszy\u0144ski, most of the American cardinals (led by John Krol), and other moderate cardinals. Wojty\u0142a accepted Wojty\u0142a's election with the words: \"With obedience in faith to Christ, my Lord, and with trust in the Mother of Christ, my Lord and the Church, in spite of great difficulties, Wojty\u0142a accept\". Wojty\u0142a, in tribute to [0], then took the regnal name of John Paul II, also in honor of [0], and the traditional white smoke informed the crowd gathered in St. Peter's Square that a pope had been chosen. There had been rumors that Wojty\u0142a wished to be known as Pope Stanislaus in honor of the Polish saint of the name, but was convinced by the cardinals that Pope Stanislaus was not a Roman name. When Wojty\u0142a appeared on the balcony, Wojty\u0142a broke tradition by addressing the gathered crowd:\"Dear brothers and sisters, we are saddened at the death of Pope Paul VI, and so the cardinals have called for a new bishop of Rome. the cardinals called a new bishop of Rome from a faraway land\u2014far and yet always close because of we's communion in faith and Christian traditions.

If This first papal trip to Poland inspired a riot, the Communist leaders of Poland, where ecstatic crowds constantly surrounded him were prepared to crush the uprising and blame the suffering on [0].[0] won that struggle by transcending politics. [0]'s was what Joseph Nye calls 'soft power' \u2014 the power of attraction and repulsion. [0] began with an enormous advantage, and exploited an enormous advantage to the utmost: [0] headed the one institution that stood for the polar opposite of the Communist way of life that the people hated. [0] was a Pole, but beyond the regime's's reach. By identifying with [0], Poles would have the chance to cleanse Poles of the compromises Poles had to make to live under the regime's. And so Poles came to [0] by the millions. Poles listened. [0] told Poles to be good, not to compromise Poles, to stick by one another, to be fearless, and that God is the only source of goodness, the only standard of conduct. 'Be not afraid,' [0] said. Millions shouted in response, 'Millions want God! Millions want God! Millions want God!' the regime's cowered. Had [0] chosen to turn [0]'s soft power into the hard variety, the regime's might have been drowned in blood. Instead, [0] simply led the people to desert the people's rulers by affirming solidarity with one another. The Communists managed to hold on as despots a decade longer. But as political leaders, The Communists were finished. Visiting his native Poland in 1979, [0] struck what turned out to be a mortal blow to his native Poland's , to the Soviet Empire, [and] ultimately to Communism.\"\"When [0] kissed the ground at the Warsaw airport [0] began the process by which Communism in Poland, where ecstatic crowds constantly surrounded him \u2014 and ultimately elsewhere in Europe \u2014 would come to an end.\" On later trips to PolandPoland, where ecstatic crowds constantly surrounded him, [0] gave tacit support to the Solidarity movement. later trips to Poland reinforced this message and contributed to the collapse of East European Communism that took place between 1989 and 1990 with the reintroduction of democracy in Poland, where ecstatic crowds constantly surrounded him, and which then spread through Eastern Europe (1990\u20131991) and South-Eastern Europe (1990\u20131992).", "World Youth Days": "[0] is our person to focus on. As an extension of [0]'s successful work with youth as a young priest, [0] pioneered the international World Youth Days.

Keenly aware of the rhythms of time and the importance of anniversaries in the Catholic Church's life, [0] led nine \"dedicated years\" during the twenty-six and a half years of [0]'s pontificate: the Holy Year of the Redemption in 1983\u201384, the Marian Year in 1987\u201388, the Year of the Family in 1993\u201394, the three Trinitarian years of preparation for the Great Jubilee of 2000, the Great Jubilee of 2000, the Year of the Rosary in 2002\u20133, and the Year of the Eucharist, which began on 17 October 2004, and concluded six months after [0]'s death.", "Great Jubilee of 2000": "John Paul II is our person to focus on. The Great Jubilee of 2000 was a call to [0] to become more aware and to embrace her missionary task for the work of evangelization.\"From the beginning of John Paul II's Pontificate, John Paul II's thoughts had been on 2000 as an important appointment. John Paul II thought of 2000's celebration as a providential opportunity during which [0], thirty-five years after the Second Vatican Ecumenical Council, would examine how far [0] had renewed [0], in order to be able to take up her missionary task for the work of evangelization with fresh enthusiasm.\" John Paul II also made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land for The Great Jubilee of 2000. During John Paul II's visit to the Holy Land, John Paul II visited many sites of the Rosary, including the following locations: Bethany Beyond the Jordan (Al-Maghtas), at the Jordan, where John the Baptist baptized Jesus; Manger Square and the Church of the Nativity in the town of Bethlehem, the location of Jesus's birth; and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, the site of Jesus's burial and resurrection.", "": ""}, "Teachings": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. As pope, [0] wrote 14 papal encyclicals and taught about sexuality in what is referred as the \"Theology of the Body\". Some key elements of [0]'s strategy to \"reposition the Catholic Church\" were encyclicals such as Ecclesia de Eucharistia, Reconciliatio et paenitentia and Redemptoris Mater. In [0] At the beginning of the new millennium (Novo Millennio Ineunte), [0] emphasised the importance of \"starting afresh from Christ\": \"No, we shall not be saved by a formula but by a Person.\" In The Splendour of the Truth (Veritatis Splendor), [0] emphasised the dependence of man on God and God's Law (\"Without God, the creature disappears\") and the \"dependence of freedom on the truth\". [0] warned that man \"giving man over to relativism and scepticism, goes off in search of an illusory freedom apart from truth itselftruth itself\". In Fides et Ratio (On the Relationship between Faith and Reason) [0] promoted a renewed interest in philosophy and an autonomous pursuit of truth in theological matters. Drawing on many different sources (such as Thomism), [0] described the mutually supporting relationship between faith and reason, and emphasised that theologians should focus on the mutually supporting relationship between faith and reason. [0] wrote extensively about workers and the social doctrine of the Catholic Church, which [0] discussed in three encyclicals: Laborem exercens, Sollicitudo rei socialis, and Centesimus annus. Through 14 papal encyclicals and many Apostolic Letters and Exhortations, [0] talked about the dignity and the equality of women. [0] argued for the importance of the family for the future of humanity.Other encyclicals include The Gospel of Life (Evangelium Vitae) and Ut Unum Sint (That They May Be One). Though critics accused [0] of inflexibility in explicitly re-asserting Catholic moral teachings against abortion and euthanasia that have been in place for well over a thousand years, [0] urged a more nuanced view of capital punishment. In [0]'s second encyclical Dives in misericordia [0] stressed that divine mercy is the greatest feature of God, needed especially in modern times.", "Social and political stances": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was considered a conservative on doctrine and issues relating to human sexual reproduction and the ordination of women. While [0] was visiting the United States in 1977, the year before becoming pope, Wojty\u0142a said: \"All human life, from the moments of conception and through all subsequent stages, is sacred.\"A series of 129 lectures given by [0] during [0]'s Wednesday audiences in Rome between September 1979 and November 1984 were later compiled and published as a single work titled Theology of the Body, an extended meditation on human sexuality. [0] extended a single work titled Theology of the Body, an extended meditation on human sexuality to the condemnation of abortion, euthanasia, and virtually all capital punishment, calling abortion, euthanasia, and virtually all capital punishment a part of a struggle between a \"culture of life\" and a \"culture of death\". [0] campaigned for world debt forgiveness and social justice. [0] coined the term \"social mortgage\", which related that all private property had a social dimension, namely that \"the goods of all private property are originally meant for all.\" In 2000, [0] publicly endorsed the Jubilee 2000 campaign on African debt relief fronted by Irish rock stars Bob Geldof and Bono, once famously interrupting a U2 recording session by telephoning the studio and asking to speak to Bono.[0]the 1962\u201365 Second Vatican Council, affirmed the teachings of that Council and did much to implement the teachings of that Council. Nevertheless, [0]'s critics often wished that [0] would embrace what has been called a progressive agenda that some hoped would evolve as a result of the 1962\u201365 Second Vatican Council. In fact, the 1962\u201365 Second Vatican Council did not advocate progressive changes in these areas; for example, the 1962\u201365 Second Vatican Council still condemned abortion as an unspeakable crime. [0] continued to declare that contraception, abortion, and homosexual acts were gravely sinful, and, along with Joseph Ratzinger (future Pope Benedict XVI), opposed liberation theology.Following the church's's exaltation of the marital act of sexual intercourse between a baptised man and woman within sacramental marriage as proper and exclusive to the sacrament of marriage, [0] believed that the marital act of sexual intercourse between a baptised man and woman within sacramental marriage was, in every instance, profaned by contraception, abortion, divorce followed by a 'second' marriage, and by homosexual acts. In 1994, [0] asserted the church's's lack of authority to ordain women to the priesthood, stating that without such authority ordination is not legitimately compatible with fidelity to Christ. asserted was also deemed a repudiation of calls to break with the constant tradition of the church's by ordaining women to the priesthood. In addition, [0] chose not to end the discipline of mandatory priestly celibacy, although in a small number of unusual circumstances, [0] did allow certain married clergymen of other Christian traditions who later became Catholic to be ordained as Catholic priests.", "Apartheid in South Africa": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was an outspoken opponent of apartheid in South Africa. In 1985, while visiting the Netherlands, [0] gave an impassioned speech condemning apartheid at the International Court of Justice, proclaiming that \"No system of apartheid or separate development will ever be acceptable as a model for the relations between peoples or races.\" In September 1988, [0] made a pilgrimage to ten Southern African countries, including those bordering South Africa, while demonstratively avoiding South Africa. During [0]'s visit to Zimbabwe, [0] called for economic sanctions against South Africa. After [0]'s death, both Nelson Mandela and Archbishop Desmond Tutu praised [0] for defending human rights and condemning economic injustice.", "Capital punishment": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was an outspoken opponent of the death penalty, although previous popes had accepted the death penalty. At a papal mass in St. Louis, Missouri, in the United States [0] said:\"A sign of hope is the increasing recognition that the dignity of human life must never be taken away, even in the case of someone who has done great evil. Modern society has the means of protecting Modern society, without definitively denying criminals the chance to reform. [0] renew the appeal [0] made most recently at Christmas for a consensus to end the death penalty.\" During that visit, [0] convinced the then governor of Missouri, in the United States, Mel Carnahan, to reduce the death sentence of convicted murderer Darrell J. Mease to life imprisonment without parole. [0]'s other attempts to reduce the sentence of death-row inmates were unsuccessful. In 1983, [0] visited Guatemala and unsuccessfully asked Guatemala's president, Efra\u00edn R\u00edos Montt, to reduce the sentence for six left-wing guerrillas sentenced to death.In 2002, [0] again travelled to Guatemala. At that time, Guatemala was one of only two countries in Latin America (the other being Cuba) to apply capital punishment. [0] asked the Guatemalan president, Alfonso Portillo, for a moratorium on executions.", "Environment and ecology": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] taught on the environmental health of Earth that \"humanity has disappointed God's expectations ... degrading that 'flowerbed' which is the earth, our dwelling-place\". [0]'s phrase and exhortation, \"ecological conversion\", which was used in a general audience in The Vatican in 2001, has been widely adopted, for example in the Mandate for Catholic Earthcare Australia, and in the writings of Pope Francis.", "European Union": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] pushed for a reference to Europe's's Christian cultural roots in the draft of the European Constitution. In [0]'s 2003 apostolic exhortation Ecclesia in Europa, [0] wrote that [0] \"fully (respected) the secular nature of (European) institutions\". However, [0] wanted the European Constitution to enshrine religious rights, including acknowledging the rights of religious groups to organise freely, recognise the specific identity of each denomination and allow for a \"structured dialogue\" between each religious community and the European Union (EU), and extend across the European Union (EU) the legal status enjoyed by religious institutions in individual member states. [0] said: \"[0] wish once more to appeal to those drawing up the future European Constitutional Treaty so that the future European Constitutional Treaty will include a reference to the religion and in particular to the Christian heritage of Europe.\" [0]'s desire for a reference to the Christian heritage of Europe in the European Constitution the European Union (EU) was supported by non-Catholic representatives of the Church of England and Eastern Orthodox Churches from Russia, Romania, and Greece. [0]'s demand to include a reference to the Christian heritage of Europe in the European Constitution was supported by some non-Christians, such as Joseph Weiler, a practising Orthodox Jew and renowned constitutional lawyer, who said that the European Constitution's lack of a reference to Christianity was not a \"demonstration of neutrality\" but rather \"a Jacobin attitude\".At the same time, [0] was an enthusiastic supporter of European integration; in particular, [0] supported his native Poland's's entry into the bloc. On 19 May 2003, three weeks before a referendum was held in his native Poland's on the European Union (EU) membership, [0] addressed [0]'s and urged his compatriots to vote for his native Poland's's the European Union (EU) membership at St. Peter's Square in Vatican City State. While some conservative, Catholic politicians in his native Poland's opposed the European Union (EU) membership, [0] said:\"I know that there are many in opposition to integration. [0] appreciate many in opposition to integration's concern about maintaining the cultural and religious identity of our nation. However, [0] must emphasise that his native Poland's has always been an important part of Europe's. Europe's needs his native Poland's. The Church in Europe's needs the Poles' testimony of faith. his native Poland's needs Europe's.\" [0] compared his native Poland's's entry into the European Union (EU) to the Union of Lublin, which was signed in 1569 and united his native Poland's and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania into one nation and created an elective monarchy.", "Evolution": "[0] is our person to focus on. On 22 October 1996, in a speech to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences plenary session at the Vatican, [0] said of evolution that \"evolution has been progressively accepted by researchers, following a series of discoveries in various fields of knowledge. The convergence, neither sought nor fabricated, of the results of work that was conducted independently is in itself a significant argument in favour of evolution.\" [0]'s embrace of evolution was enthusiastically praised by American paleontologist and evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould, with whom [0] had an audience in 1984.Although generally accepting evolution, [0] made one major exception\u2014the human soul, saying: \"If the human body has the human body's origin in living material which pre-exists the human body, the spiritual soul is immediately created by God.\"", "Iraq War": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 2003 [0] criticised the 2003 United States-led invasion of Iraq, saying in [0]'s State of the World address \"No to war! War is not always inevitable. War is always a defeat for humanity.\" [0] sent Pio Cardinal Laghi, the former Apostolic Pro-Nuncio to the United States, to talk with George W. Bush, the US president, to express opposition to the 2003 United States-led invasion of Iraq. [0] said that it was up to the United Nations to solve the international conflict through diplomacy and that a unilateral aggression is a crime against peace and a violation of international law. [0]'s opposition to the 2003 United States-led invasion of Iraq led to [0] being a candidate to win the 2003 Nobel Peace Prize, which was ultimately awarded to Iranian attorney/judge and noted human rights advocate Shirin Ebadi.", "Liberation theology": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 1984 and 1986, through Cardinal Ratzinger (future Pope Benedict XVI) as Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, [0] officially condemned aspects of liberation theology, which had many followers in Latin America.Visiting Europe, Salvadoran Archbishop \u00d3scar Romero unsuccessfully advocated for the Vatican to condemn the right-wing military regime of El Salvador, for violations of human rights during the Salvadoran Civil War and the support of death squads. Though Salvadoran Archbishop \u00d3scar Romero expressed Salvadoran Archbishop \u00d3scar Romero's frustration at working with clergy who cooperated with the right-wing military regime of El Salvador, [0] encouraged Salvadoran Archbishop \u00d3scar Romero to maintain episcopal unity as a top priority.In his travel to Managua, Nicaragua in 1983, [0] harshly condemned what [0] dubbed the \"popular Church\", referencing the ecclesial base communities supported by the CELAM, and the Nicaraguan clergy's tendencies to support the leftist Sandinistas, reminding the clergy of the clergy's duties of obedience to the Holy See. During his travel to Managua, Nicaragua in 1983 Ernesto Cardenal, a priest and minister in the Sandinista government, knelt to kiss [0]'s . [0] withdrew his hand, wagged [0]'s finger in Ernesto Cardenal, a priest and minister in the Sandinista government,'s face, and told Ernesto Cardenal, a priest and minister in the Sandinista government,, \"Ernesto Cardenal, a priest and minister in the Sandinista government, must straighten out Ernesto Cardenal, a priest and minister in the Sandinista government,'s position with the church.\"", "Organised crime": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was the first pontiff to denounce Mafia violence in Southern Italy. In 1993, during a pilgrimage to Agrigento, Sicily, [0] appealed to the Mafiosi: \"[0] say to those responsible: 'Convert! One day, the judgment of God will arrive!'\" In 1994, [0] visited Catania and told victims of Mafia violence to \"rise up and cloak victims of Mafia violence in light and justice!\"In 1995, the Mafia bombed two historical churches in Rome. Some believed that bombed was the Mafia's vendetta against [0] for [0]'s denunciations of organised crime.", "Persian Gulf War": "[0] is our person to focus on. Between 1990 and 1991, a 34-nation coalition led by the United States waged a war against Saddam Hussein's Iraq, which had invaded and annexed Kuwait. [0] was a staunch opponent of a war against Saddam Hussein's Iraq, which had invaded and annexed Kuwait. Throughout a war against Saddam Hussein's Iraq, which had invaded and annexed Kuwait, [0] appealed to the international community to stop a war against Saddam Hussein's Iraq, which had invaded and annexed Kuwait, and after a war against Saddam Hussein's Iraq, which had invaded and annexed Kuwait was over led diplomatic initiatives to negotiate peace in the Middle East. In [0]'s 1991 encyclical Centesimus Annus, [0] harshly condemned the conflict:\"No, never again war, which destroys the lives of innocent people, teaches how to kill, throws into upheaval even the lives of those who do the killing and leaves behind a trail of resentment and hatred, thus making it all the more difficult to find a just solution of the very problems which provoked the war.\" In April 1991, during [0]'s Urbi et Orbi Sunday message at St. Peter's Basilica, [0] called for the international community to \"lend an ear\" to \"the long-ignored aspirations of oppressed peoples\". [0] specifically named the Kurds, a people who were fighting a civil war against Saddam Hussein's's troops in Saddam Hussein's Iraq, which had invaded and annexed Kuwait, as one such people, and referred to a war against Saddam Hussein's Iraq, which had invaded and annexed Kuwait as a \"darkness menacing the earth\". During this time, the Vatican had expressed the Vatican's frustration with the international ignoring of [0]'s calls for peace in the Middle East.", "Rwandan genocide": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 1990, during the civil war between Tutsis and Hutus in the mostly Catholic country of Rwanda, [0] called for a ceasefire and condemned the persecution of Tutsis.

[0] said:\"What is happening in Rwanda and Burundi is a terrible tragedy that must end. During the African Synod, we, the pastors of the church, felt the duty to express we, the pastors of the church's consternation and to launch an appeal for forgiveness and reconciliation.

While taking a traditional position on human sexuality, maintaining the Catholic Church's's moral opposition to homosexual acts, [0] asserted that people with homosexual inclinations possess the same inherent dignity and rights as others. In his book Memory and Identity, [0] referred to the \"strong pressures\" by the European Parliament to recognise homosexual unions as an alternative type of family, with the right to adopt children. In his book Memory and Identity, as quoted by Reuters, [0] wrote: \"It is legitimate and necessary to ask oneself if the \"strong pressures\" by the European Parliament to recognise homosexual unions as an alternative type of family, with the right to adopt children is not perhaps part of a new ideology of evil, more subtle and hidden, perhaps, intent upon exploiting human rights themselves against man and against the family.\"In 1986, the Pope approved the release of a document from the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith regarding Letter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons. While not neglecting to comment on homosexuality and moral order, a document from the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith regarding Letter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons issued multiple affirmations of the dignity of homosexual persons.A 1997 study determined that of all the Pope's public statements, only 3% addressed the issue of sexual morality."}, "Reform of canon law": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on.

Only because there was a Polish pope. a Polish pope was in Chile and Pinochet was out. a Polish pope was in Haiti and Duvalier was out. a Polish pope was in the Philippines and Marcos was out.

Before [0]'s pilgrimage to Latin America, during a meeting with reporters, [0] criticised Augusto Pinochet's regime as \"dictatorial\". In the words of The New York Times, [0] used \"unusually strong language\" to criticise Augusto Pinochet's and asserted to journalists that the church in Chile must not only pray, but actively fight for the restoration of democracy in Chile.During his visit to Chile in 1987, [0] asked Chile's 31 Catholic bishops to campaign for free elections in Chile. According to George Weigel and Cardinal Stanis\u0142aw Dziwisz, [0] encouraged Augusto Pinochet's to accept a democratic opening of Augusto Pinochet's regime, and may even have called for Augusto Pinochet's's resignation. According to Monsignor S\u0142awomir Oder, the postulator of [0]'s beatification cause, John Paul's words to Pinochet had a profound impact on Augusto Pinochet's. The pope confided to a friend: \"The pope received a letter from Augusto Pinochet's in which Augusto Pinochet's told The pope that as a Catholic Augusto Pinochet's had listened to John Paul's words to Pinochet, Augusto Pinochet's had accepted John Paul's words to Pinochet, and Augusto Pinochet's had decided to begin the process to change the leadership of Augusto Pinochet's's .\"During his visit to Chile in 1987, [0] supported the Vicariate of Solidarity, the church-led pro-democracy, anti-Pinochet organisation.

Chile's anti-Pinochet democratic opposition praised [0] for denouncing Augusto Pinochet's as a dictator, for many members of Chile's anti-Pinochet democratic opposition were persecuted for much milder statements. Bishop Carlos Camus, one of the harshest critics of Pinochet's dictatorship within the Chilean Church, praised [0]'s stance during his visit to Chile in 1987, saying: \"Bishop Carlos Camus, one of the harshest critics of Pinochet's dictatorship within the Chilean Church am quite moved, because [0] supports our totally.

The Requiem Mass held on 8 April 2005 was the single largest gathering of heads of state up to that time, surpassing the funerals of Winston Churchill (1965) and Josip Broz Tito (1980). Four kings, five queens, at least 70 presidents and prime ministers, and more than 14 leaders of other religions attended. An estimated four million mourners gathered in and around Vatican City. Between 250,000 and 300,000 watched The Requiem Mass held on 8 April 2005 from within Vatican City's walls. In a historical rarity, Protestant and Eastern Orthodox leaders, as well as representatives and heads from Judaism, Islam, Druze and Buddhism, offered Protestant and Eastern Orthodox leaders, as well as representatives and heads from Judaism, Islam, Druze and Buddhism's own memorials and prayers as a way of sympathising with the grief of Catholics.The Dean of The College of Cardinals, which in passing, preferred burial beneath St. Peter's Basilica, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, conducted The Requiem Mass held on 8 April 2005.

Upon the death of [0], a number of clergy at the Vatican and laymen began referring to [0] as \"John Paul the Great\" \u2014 in theory only the fourth pope to be so acclaimed. Cardinal Angelo Sodano specifically referred to [0] as \"the Great\" in Cardinal Angelo Sodano's published written homily for [0]'s funeral Mass of Repose. The South African Catholic newspaper The Southern Cross has referred to [0] in print as \"John Paul II the Great\". Some Catholic educational institutions in the US have additionally changed Some Catholic educational institutions in the US's names to incorporate \"the Great\", including John Paul the Great Catholic University and schools called some variant of John Paul the Great High School.Scholars of canon law say that there is no official process for declaring a pope \"Great\"; the title simply establishes the title through popular and continued usage, as was the case with celebrated secular leaders (for example, Alexander III of Macedon became popularly known as Alexander the Great). The three popes who today commonly are known as \"Great\" are Leo I, who reigned from 440\u2013461 and persuaded Attila the Hun to withdraw from Rome; Gregory I, 590\u2013604, after whom the Gregorian Chant is named; and Pope Nicholas I, 858\u2013867, who consolidated the Catholic Church in the Western world in the Middle Ages.John Paul's successor, Benedict XVI, did not use the title directly in public speeches, but made oblique references to \"[0]\" in John Paul's successor, Benedict XVI,'s first address from the loggia of St. Peter's Basilica, at the 20th World Youth Day in Germany 2005 when John Paul's successor, Benedict XVI, said in Polish: \"As [0] would say: Keep the flame of faith alive in your's lives and your's people\"; and in May 2006 during a visit to Poland where John Paul's successor, Benedict XVI, repeatedly made references to \"[0]\" and \"John Paul's successor, Benedict XVI,'s great predecessor\".", "Institutions named after John Paul II": "", "Beatification": "[0] is our person to focus on.

In an audience with Benedict XVI, Camillo Ruini, Vicar General of the Diocese of Rome, who was responsible for promoting the cause for canonisation of any person who died within the Diocese of Rome, cited \"exceptional circumstances\", which suggested that five years could be waived. waived was announced on 13 May 2005, the Feast of Our Lady of F\u00e1tima and the 24th anniversary of the assassination attempt on [0] at St. Peter's Square.In early 2006, it was reported that the Vatican was investigating a possible miracle associated with [0].

During Benedict XVI's homily, Benedict XVI encouraged prayers for the early canonisation of [0] and stated that Benedict XVI hoped canonisation would happen \"in the near future\".In January 2007, Cardinal Stanis\u0142aw Dziwisz announced that the interview phase of the beatification process for his predecessor, in Italy and John Paul II's native Poland, was nearing completion. In February 2007, second class relics of [0]\u2014pieces of white papal cassocks [0] used to wear\u2014were freely distributed with prayer cards for the cause, a typical pious practice after a saintly Catholic's death.

On the fourth anniversary of the Pontiff's death, 2 April 2009, Cardinal Stanis\u0142aw Dziwisz, told reporters of a presumed miracle that had recently occurred at the former pope's tomb in St. Peter's Basilica. A nine-year-old Polish boy from Gda\u0144sk, who was suffering from kidney cancer and was completely unable to walk, had been visiting the former pope's tomb in St. Peter's Basilica with A nine-year-old Polish boy from Gda\u0144sk, who was suffering from kidney cancer and was completely unable to walk's . On leaving St. Peter's Basilica, A nine-year-old Polish boy from Gda\u0144sk, who was suffering from kidney cancer and was completely unable to walk told his parents, \"A nine-year-old Polish boy from Gda\u0144sk, who was suffering from kidney cancer and was completely unable to walk want to walk,\" and began walking normally. On 16 November 2009, a panel of reviewers at the Vatican's Congregation for the Causes of Saints voted unanimously that [0] had lived a life of heroic virtue. On 19 December 2009, Benedict XVI signed the first of two decrees needed for beatification and proclaimed [0] \"Venerable\", asserting that [0] had lived a heroic, virtuous life. The second vote and the second signed decree certifying the authenticity of the first miracle, the curing of Sister Marie Simon-Pierre, a French nun, from Parkinson's disease. Once the second signed decree certifying the authenticity of the first miracle, the curing of Sister Marie Simon-Pierre, a French nun, from Parkinson's disease is signed, the position (the report on John Paul's cause for beatification, with documentation about [0]'s life and writings and with information on John Paul's cause for beatification) is complete. [0] can then be beatified. Some speculated that [0] would be beatified sometime during (or soon after) the month of the 32nd anniversary of [0]'s 1978 election, in October 2010. As Monsignor Oder said, beatified would have been possible if the second signed decree certifying the authenticity of the first miracle, the curing of Sister Marie Simon-Pierre, a French nun, from Parkinson's disease were signed in time by Benedict XVI, stating that a posthumous miracle directly attributable to [0]'s intercession had occurred, completing the positio.the Vatican announced on 14 January 2011 that Benedict XVI had confirmed the miracle involving Sister Marie Simon-Pierre Sister Marie Simon-Pierre, a French nun and member of the Congregation of Little Sisters of Catholic Maternity Wards, confined to her bed byParkinson's disease and that [0] was to be beatified on 1 May, the Feast of Divine Mercy. 1 May, the Feast of Divine Mercy is commemorated in former Communist countries, such as John Paul II's native Poland, and some Western European countries as May Day, and [0] was well known for [0]'s contributions to Communism's relatively peaceful demise. In March 2011 the Polish mint issued a gold 1,000 Polish z\u0142oty coin (equivalent to US$350), with [0]'s image to commemorate [0]'s .On 29 April 2011, [0]'s coffin was disinterred from the grotto beneath St. Peter's Basilica ahead of [0]'s , as tens of thousands of people arrived in Rome for one of the biggest events since [0]'s funeral. John Paul II's remains, which were not exposed, were placed in front of St. Peter's Basilica's main altar, where believers could pay believers's respect before and after the beatification mass in St. Peter's Square on 1 May, the Feast of Divine Mercy. On 3 May 2011 John Paul II's remains, which were not exposed were interred in the marble altar in Pier Paolo Cristofari Chapel of St. Sebastian, where Pope Innocent XI was buried. This more prominent location, next to the Chapel of the Piet\u00e0, the Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament, and statues of Popes Pius XI and Pius XII was intended to allow more pilgrims to view [0]'s memorial. John Paul II's remains, which were not exposed is located near the bodies of Pope Pius X and Pope John XXIII, whose bodies were reinterred in St. Peter's Basilica after Pope Pius X and Pope John XXIII's own beatifications and together are three of the five popes beatified in the last century. The two popes who were not exhumed and reinterred after becoming a blessed in the last century were Pope Paul VI and Pope John Paul I, who Pope Paul VI and Pope John Paul I remain entombed in the papal grottos.In July 2012, a Colombian man, Marco Fidel Rojas, the former mayor of Huila, Colombia, testified that a Colombian man, Marco Fidel Rojas, the former mayor of Huila, Colombia was \"miraculously cured\" of byParkinson's disease after a trip to Rome where a Colombian man, Marco Fidel Rojas, the former mayor of Huila, Colombia met [0] and prayed with a Colombian man, Marco Fidel Rojas, the former mayor of Huila, Colombia.

To be eligible for canonisation (being declared a saint) by the Catholic Church, two miracles must be attributed to a candidate.The first miracle attributed to [0] was the above mentioned healing of a man's Parkinson's disease, which was recognised during the beatification process. According to an article on the Catholic News Service (CNS) dated 23 April 2013, a Vatican commission of doctors concluded that a healing had no natural (medical) explanation, which is the first requirement for a claimed miracle to be officially documented. The second miracle was deemed to have taken place shortly after [0]'s beatification on 1 May 2011; The second miracle was reported to be the healing of Costa Rican woman Floribeth Mora of an otherwise terminal brain aneurysm. A Vatican panel of expert theologians examined the evidence, determined that The second miracle was directly attributable to the intercession of John Paul II, and recognised The second miracle as miraculous. The next stage was for Cardinals who compose the membership of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints to give Cardinals who compose the membership of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints's opinion to Pope Francis to decide whether to sign and promulgate the decree and set a date for canonisation.On 4 July 2013, Pope Francis confirmed Pope Francis's approval of John Paul II's canonisation, formally recognising The second miraclethe intercession of John Paul II. [0] was canonised together with John XXIII.

[0] was criticised by representatives of the victims of clergy sexual abuse for failing to respond quickly enough to the Catholic sex abuse crisis. After decades of inaction, the Catholic sex abuse crisis came to a head when Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor infamously tore up a photo of [0] on a 3 October 1992 episode of Saturday Night Live while performing an a capella rendition of Bob Marley's \"War\".In response to mounting criticism over the next decade, [0] stated in 2002 that \"there is no place in the priesthood and religious life for those who would harm the young\". The Catholic Church instituted reforms to prevent future abuse by requiring background checks for church employees and, because a significant majority of victims were boys, disallowing ordination of men with \"deep-seated homosexual tendencies\". The Catholic Church now require dioceses faced with an allegation to alert the authorities, conduct an investigation and remove the accused from duty. In 2008, The Catholic Church asserted that the Catholic sex abuse crisis was a very serious problem and estimated that the Catholic sex abuse crisis was \"probably caused by 'no more than 1 per cent'\", or 5,000, of the over 500,000 Catholic priests worldwide.In April 2002, [0], despite being frail from Parkinson's disease, summoned all the American cardinals to the Vatican to discuss possible solutions to the issue of sexual abuse in The Catholic Church. [0] asked all the American cardinals to \"diligently investigate accusations\". [0] suggested that American bishops be more open and transparent in dealing with such scandals and emphasised the role of seminary training to prevent sexual deviance among future priests. In what The New York Times called \"unusually direct language\", [0] condemned the arrogance of priests that led to the scandals:\"Priests and candidates for the priesthood often live at a level both materially and educationally superior to that of their's families and the members of their's own age group. It is therefore very easy for their to succumb to the temptation of thinking of their as better than others. When succumb happens, the ideal of priestly service and self-giving dedication can fade, leaving the priest dissatisfied and disheartened.\" [0] read a statement intended for the American cardinals, calling clergy sexual abuse \"an appalling sin\" and said the priesthood had no room for such men.In 2002, Archbishop Juliusz Paetz, the Catholic Archbishop of Pozna\u0144, was accused of molesting seminarians. [0] accepted Archbishop Juliusz Paetz, the Catholic Archbishop of Pozna\u0144,'s resignation, and placed sanctions on Archbishop Juliusz Paetz, the Catholic Archbishop of Pozna\u0144,, prohibiting Archbishop Juliusz Paetz, the Catholic Archbishop of Pozna\u0144, from exercising Archbishop Juliusz Paetz, the Catholic Archbishop of Pozna\u0144,'s ministry as bishop. It was reported that sanctions were lifted, though the Vatican spokesperson Federico Lombardi strenuously denied lifted saying \"Archbishop Juliusz Paetz, the Catholic Archbishop of Pozna\u0144,'s rehabilitation was without foundation\".In 2003, [0] reiterated that \"there is no place in the priesthood and religious life for those who would harm the young\". In April 2003, a three-day conference was held, titled \"Abuse of Children and Young People by Catholic Priests and Religious\", where eight non-Catholic psychiatric experts were invited to speak to near all the Vatican dicasteries' representatives. eight non-Catholic psychiatric experts overwhelmingly opposed implementation of policies of \"zero-tolerance\" such as was proposed by the US Conference of Catholic Bishops. One expert called such policies a \"case of overkill\" since such policies do not permit flexibility to allow for differences among individual cases.In 2004, [0] recalled Bernard Francis Law to be Archpriest of the Papal Basilica of Saint Mary Major in Rome. Bernard Francis Law had previously resigned as archbishop of Boston in 2002 in response to the Catholic Church sexual abuse cases after church documents were revealed that suggested Bernard Francis Law had covered up sexual abuse committed by priests in Bernard Francis Law's archdiocese. Bernard Francis Law resigned from Archpriest of the Papal Basilica of Saint Mary Major in Rome in November 2011.John Paul\u00a0II was a firm supporter of the Legion of Christ, and in 1998 discontinued investigations into sexual misconduct by its leader Marcial Maciel, who in 2005 resigned his leadership and was later requested by the Vatican to withdraw from his ministryits leader Marcial Maciel, who in 2005 resigned his leadership and was later requested by the Vatican to withdraw from his ministry's . However, its leader Marcial Maciel, who in 2005 resigned his leadership and was later requested by the Vatican to withdraw from his ministry's began in 2004 during the pontificate of [0], but [0] died before Maciel's trial ended and the conclusions were known. In an interview with L'Osservatore Romano, Pope Francis said: \"Pope Francis am grateful to Pope Benedict, who dared to say this publicly (when more facts began to come to light after Degollado's's death in 2008, Pope Benedict XVI in 2010 launched another investigation and on 1 May 2010 announced a declaration about the crimes of the founder of the Legionaries), and to Pope John Paul II, who dared to give the green light to the Legionaries's case\".On 10 November 2020, the Vatican published a report which found that [0] learned of allegations of sexual impropriety against former cardinal Theodore McCarrick, who at the time was serving as Archbishop of Newark, through a 1999 letter from Cardinal John O'Connor warning former cardinal Theodore McCarrick, who at the time was serving as Archbishop of Newark, that appointing former cardinal Theodore McCarrick, who at the time was serving as Archbishop of Newark, to be Archbishop of Washington D.C., a position which had recently been opened, would be a mistake. [0] ordered an investigation, which stalled when three of the four bishops tasked with investigating claims allegedly brought back \"inaccurate or incomplete information\". [0] planned on not giving former cardinal Theodore McCarrick, who at the time was serving as Archbishop of Newark, the appointment anyway, but relented and gave former cardinal Theodore McCarrick, who at the time was serving as Archbishop of Newark, the appointment after former cardinal Theodore McCarrick, who at the time was serving as Archbishop of Newark, wrote a letter of denial. [0] created former cardinal Theodore McCarrick, who at the time was serving as Archbishop of Newark, a cardinal in 2001. former cardinal Theodore McCarrick, who at the time was serving as Archbishop of Newark, would eventually be laicized after allegations surfaced that former cardinal Theodore McCarrick, who at the time was serving as Archbishop of Newark, abused minors. George Weigel, a biographer of [0], defended [0]'s actions as follows: \"former cardinal Theodore McCarrick, who at the time was serving as Archbishop of Newark, fooled a lot of people ... and former cardinal Theodore McCarrick, who at the time was serving as Archbishop of Newark, deceived [0] in a way that is laid out in almost biblical fashion in [the Vatican's] report\".In a 2019 interview with Mexican television, Pope Francis defended [0]'s legacy on protecting minors against clerical sexual abuse. Pope Francis said that [0] was \"often misled\", as in the case of Hans Hermann Gro\u00ebr. Pope Francis said that with respect to the case of Marcial Maciel:\"Ratzinger was courageous, and so was [0]. ... With respect to [0], we have to understand certain attitudes because [0] came from a closed world, from behind the Iron Curtain, where communism was still in force. There was a defensive mentality. We have to understand a defensive mentality well, and no one can doubt the saintliness of [0] and [0]'s good will. [0] was great, [0] was great.\" On March 6, 2023, an investigative report by the Polish television station TVN24 concluded that \"there [is now] no doubt\" that [0] \"knew about sexual abuse of children by priests under his authority and sought to conceal sexual abuse of children by priests under his authority when [0] was an archbishop in [0]'s native Poland\". The Dutch journalist Ekke Overbeek released a book on [0] with similar claims the following week. In response to similar claims, Pope Francis stated: \"You have to put things in the context of the era[...] At that time everything was covered up. [...] It was only when the Boston scandal broke that The Catholic Church began to look at the problem.\" The Polish Episcopal Conference stated that \"'further archival research' would be needed to arrive at a just evaluation of the decisions and actions\" of Degollado's. Furthermore, other journalists have criticised an investigative report by the Polish television station TVN24, especially the interpretation of the sources.  Another point of contention is the use of materials from the communist secret police in an investigative report by the Polish television station TVN24.
