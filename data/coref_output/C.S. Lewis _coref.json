[0] was born in Belfast in Ulster, Ireland (before partition), on 29 November 1898. His father was Albert James Lewis (1863\u20131929), a solicitor whose father Richard Lewis had come to Ireland from Wales during the mid-19th century. Lewis's mother was Florence Augusta Lewis n\u00e9e Hamilton (1862\u20131908), known as Flora, the daughter of Thomas Hamilton, a Church of Ireland priest, and the great-granddaughter of both Bishop Hugh Hamilton and John Staples. [0] had an elder brother,  Warren Hamilton Lewis (known as \"Warnie\"). [0] was baptized on 29 January 1899 by [0]'s maternal grandfather in St Mark's Church, Dundela.When his dog Jacksie was killed by a car, [0] adopted his dog Jacksie. At first, [0] would answer to no other name, but later accepted Jack, the name by which [0] was known to friends and family for the rest of [0]'s life. When [0] was seven, [0]'s family moved into \"Little Lea\", the family home of [0]'s childhood, in the Strandtown area of East Belfast.As a boy, [0] was fascinated with anthropomorphic animals; [0] fell in love with Beatrix Potter's stories and often wrote and illustrated [0]'s own animal tales. Along with an elder brother,  Warren Hamilton Lewis (known as \"Warnie\"), [0] created the world of Boxen, a fantasy land inhabited and run by animals. [0] loved to read from an early age. His father's house was filled with books; [0] later wrote that finding something to read was as easy as walking into a field and \"finding a new blade of grass\".The New House is almost a major character in [0]'s story.[0] am the product of long corridors, empty sunlit rooms,upstair indoor silences, attics explored in solitude,distant noises of gurgling cisterns and pipes,and the noise of wind under the tiles. Also, of endless books.\u2014Surprised by JoyLewis was schooled by private tutors until age nine, when Lewis's mother died in 1908 from cancer. His father then sent [0] to England to live and study at Wynyard School in Watford, Hertfordshire. [0]'s brother had enrolled there three years previously. Not long after, Wynyard School in Watford, Hertfordshire was closed due to a lack of pupils. [0] then attended Campbell College in the east of Belfast about a mile from [0]'s home, but left after a few months due to respiratory problems.[0] was then sent back to England to the health-resort town of Malvern, Worcestershire, where [0] attended the preparatory school Cherbourg House, which [0] referred to as \"Chartres\" in [0]'s autobiography. It was during this time that [0] abandoned the Christianity [0] was taught as a child and became an atheist. During this time [0] also developed a fascination with European mythology and the occult.In September 1913, [0] enrolled at Malvern College, where he remained until the following June. [0] found Malvern College, where he remained until the following June socially competitive. After leaving Malvern College, where he remained until the following June, [0] studied privately with William T. Kirkpatrick, his father's old tutor and former headmaster of Lurgan College.As a teenager, [0] was wonderstruck by the songs and legends of what he called Northernness, the ancient literature of Scandinavia preserved in the Icelandic sagas. the songs and legends of what he called Northernness, the ancient literature of Scandinavia preserved in the Icelandic sagas intensified an inner longing that [0] would later call \"joy\". [0] also grew to love nature; nature's beauty reminded [0] of the stories of the North, and the stories of the North reminded [0] of the beauties of nature. [0]'s teenage writings moved away from the tales of Boxen, and [0] began experimenting with different art forms such as epic poetry and opera to try to capture [0]'s new-found interest in Norse mythology and the natural world.Studying with William T. Kirkpatrick, his father's old tutor and former headmaster of Lurgan College William T. Kirkpatrick, his father's old tutor and former headmaster of Lurgan Collegeinstilled in [0] a love of Greek literature and mythology and sharpened [0]'s debate and reasoning skills. In 1916, [0] was awarded a scholarship at University College, Oxford.", "\"My Irish life\"": "[0]  is our person to focus on. [0] experienced a certain cultural shock on first arriving in England: \"No Englishman will be able to understand [0]'s first impressions of England,\" [0] wrote in Surprised by Joy. \"The strange English accents with which [0] was surrounded seemed like the voices of demons. But what was worst was the English landscape\u00a0... [0] have made up the quarrel since; but at that moment [0] conceived a hatred for England which took many years to heal.\"From boyhood, [0] had immersed [0] in Norse and Greek mythology, and later in Irish mythology and literature. [0] also expressed an interest in the Irish language, though there is not much evidence that [0] laboured to learn the Irish language. [0] developed a particular fondness for W. B. Yeats, in part because of W. B. Yeats's use of Ireland's Celtic heritage in poetry. In a letter to a friend, [0] wrote, \"[0] have here discovered W. B. YeatsW. B. Yeats. W. B. Yeats writes plays and poems of rare spirit and beauty about our old Irish mythology.\"In 1921, [0] met W. B. Yeats twice, since W. B. Yeats had moved to Oxford. [0] was surprised to find [0]'s English peers indifferent to W. B. Yeats and the Celtic Revival movement, and wrote: \"[0] am often surprised to find how utterly ignored W. B. Yeats is among the men [0] have met: perhaps W. B. Yeats's appeal is purely Irish\u00a0\u2013 if so, then thank the gods that [0] am Irish.\" Early in [0]'s career, [0] considered sending [0]'s work to the major Dublin publishers, writing: \"If [0] do ever send [0]'s stuff to a publisher, [0] think [0] shall try Maunsel, those Dublin people, and so tack [0] definitely onto the Irish school.\"After [0]'s conversion to Christianity, [0]'s interests gravitated towards Christian theology and away from pagan Celtic mysticism (as opposed to Celtic Christian mysticism).Lewis occasionally expressed a somewhat tongue-in-cheek chauvinism towards the Irish language. Describing an encounter with a fellow Irishman, [0] wrote: \"Like all Irish people who meet in England, we ended by criticisms on the invincible flippancy and dullness of the Anglo-Saxon race. After all, there is no doubt, ami, that the Irish language are the only people: with all the Irish language's faults, [0] would not gladly live or die among another folk.\" Throughout [0]'s life, [0] sought out the company of other Irish people living in England and visited Northern Ireland regularly. In 1958 [0] spent [0]'s honeymoon there at the Old Inn, Crawfordsburn, which [0] called \"my Irish life\".Various critics have suggested that it was [0]'s dismay over the sectarian conflict in [0]'s native Belfast which led [0] to eventually adopt such an ecumenical brand of Christianity. As one critic has said, [0] \"repeatedly extolled the virtues of all branches of the Christian faith, emphasising a need for unity among Christians around what the Catholic writer G. K. Chesterton called 'Mere Christianity', the core doctrinal beliefs that all denominations share\". On the other hand, Paul Stevens of the University of Toronto has written that \"[0]'s mere Christianity masked many of the political prejudices of an old-fashioned Ulster Protestant, a native of middle-class Belfast for whom British withdrawal from Northern Ireland even in the 1950s and 1960s was unthinkable.\"", "First World War and Oxford University": "[0]  is our person to focus on. [0] entered Oxford in the 1917 summer term, studying at University College, and shortly after, [0] joined the Officers' Training Corps at Oxford as [0]'s \"most promising route into the army\". From there, [0] was drafted into a Cadet Battalion for training. After [0]'s , [0] was commissioned into the 3rd Battalion of the Somerset Light Infantry of the British Army as a Second Lieutenant, and was later transferred to the 1st Battalion of the regiment, then serving in France ([0] would not remain with the 3rd Battalion of the Somerset Light Infantry of the British Army as the 3rd Battalion of the Somerset Light Infantry of the British Army moved to Northern Ireland). Within months of entering Oxford, [0] was shipped by the army to France to fight in the First World War.On [0]'s 19th birthday (29 November 1917), [0] arrived at the front line in the Somme Valley in France, where [0] experienced trench warfare for the first time. On 15 April 1918, as the 1st Battalion of the regiment, then serving in France assaulted the village of Riez du Vinage in the midst of the German spring offensive, [0] was wounded and two of [0]'s colleagues were killed by a British shell falling short of its targeta British shell falling short of its target's . [0] was depressed and homesick during [0]'s convalescence and, upon [0]'s recovery in October, [0] was assigned to duty in Andover, England. [0] was demobilized in December 1918 and soon restarted [0]'s studies. In a later letter, [0] stated that [0]'s experience of the horrors of war, along with the loss of [0]'s mother and unhappiness in school, were the basis of [0]'s pessimism and atheism.After [0] returned to Oxford, [0] received a First in Honour Moderations (Greek and Latin literature) in 1920, a First in Greats (Philosophy and Ancient History) in 1922, and a First in English in 1923. In 1924 [0] became a Philosophy tutor at University College and, in 1925, was elected a Fellow and Tutor in English Literature at Magdalen College, where [0] served for 29 years until 1954.", "Janie Moore": "[0]  is our person to focus on. During [0]'s army training, [0] shared a room with another cadet, Edward Courtnay Francis \"Paddy\" Moore (1898\u20131918). Maureen Moore, Paddy's sister, another cadet, Edward Courtnay Francis \"Paddy\" Moore (1898\u20131918)'s said that the two made a mutual pact that if either died during the war, the survivor would take care of both of the two's families. another cadet, Edward Courtnay Francis \"Paddy\" Moore (1898\u20131918) was killed in action in 1918 and [0] kept [0]'s promise. another cadet, Edward Courtnay Francis \"Paddy\" Moore (1898\u20131918) had earlier introduced [0] to another cadet, Edward Courtnay Francis \"Paddy\" Moore (1898\u20131918)'s , and a friendship quickly sprang up between Lewis, who was 18 when the two met, and his mother, Janie King Moore. a friendship his mother, Janie King Moore was particularly important to [0] while [0] was recovering from [0]'s wounds in hospital, as his father did not visit [0].[0] lived with and cared for his mother, Janie King Moore until his mother, Janie King Moore was hospitalized in the late 1940s. [0] routinely introduced his mother, Janie King Moore as his mother, Janie King Moore, referred to his mother, Janie King Moore as such in letters, and developed a deeply affectionate friendship with his mother, Janie King Moore. [0]'s own mother had died when [0] was a child, while his father was distant, demanding, and eccentric.Speculation regarding their relationship resurfaced with the 1990 publication of A. N. Wilson's biography of Lewis. A. N. Wilson's attempted to make a case for the two's having been lovers for a time. A. N. Wilson's biography of Lewis was not the first to address the question of their relationshiphis mother, Janie King Moore. George Sayer knew [0] for 29 years, and George Sayer had sought to shed light on their relationship during the period of 14 years before [0]'s conversion to Christianity. In George Sayer's biography Jack: A Life of [0], George Sayer wrote:Were the two lovers? Owen Barfield, who knew Jack well in the 1920s, once said that Owen Barfield, who knew Jack well in the 1920s, thought the likelihood was \"fifty-fifty\". Although Jack was twenty-six years older than Jack, Jack was still a handsome woman, and [0] was certainly infatuated with Jack. But it seems very odd, if the two were lovers, that [0] would call Jack \"mother\". We know, too, that the two did not share the same bedroom. It seems most likely that [0] was bound to Jack by the promise [0] had given to another cadet, Edward Courtnay Francis \"Paddy\" Moore (1898\u20131918) and that [0]'s promise was reinforced by [0]'s love for his mother, Janie King Moore as [0]'s second mother. Later George Sayer changed George Sayer's mind. In the introduction to the 1997 edition of A. N. Wilson's biography of Lewis George Sayer wrote:George Sayer have had to alter George Sayer's opinion of their relationshiphis mother, Janie King Moore. In chapter eight of A. N. Wilson's biography of Lewis George Sayer wrote that George Sayer was uncertain about whether the two were lovers.  Now after conversations with Maureen Moore, Paddy's sister,, and a consideration of the way in which the two's bedrooms were arranged at The Kilns, George Sayer am quite certain that the two were. However, the romantic nature of their relationship is doubted by other writers; for example, Philip Zaleski and Carol Zaleski write in The Fellowship thatWhen\u2014or whether\u2014[0] commenced an affair with his mother, Janie King Moore remains unclear. [0] spoke well of his mother, Janie King Moore throughout [0]'s life, saying to George Sayer, \"his mother, Janie King Moore was generous and taught [0] to be generous, too.\" In December 1917, [0] wrote in a letter to his childhood friend Arthur Greeves that his mother, Janie King Moore and his childhood friend Arthur Greeves were \"the two people who matter most to [0] in the world\".In 1930, [0] moved into The Kilns with his brother Warnie, Mrs. Moore, and her daughter Maureen. The Kilns was a house in the district of Headington Quarry on the outskirts of Oxford, now part of the suburb of Risinghurst. his brother Warnie, Mrs. Moore, and her daughter Maureen contributed financially to the purchase of the house, which eventually passed to Maureen Moore, Paddy's sister,, when [0] died in his mother, Janie King Moore had dementia in his mother, Janie King Moore's later years and was eventually moved into a nursing home, where she died in 1951. [0] visited his mother, Janie King Moore every day in a nursing home, where she died in 1951 until his mother, Janie King Moore's .", "Return to Christianity": "[0]  is our person to focus on. [0] was raised in a religious family that attended the Church of Ireland. [0] became an atheist at age 15, though [0] later described [0] as being paradoxically \"very angry with God for not existing\" and \"equally angry with God for creating a world\". [0]'s early separation from Christianity began when [0] started to view [0]'s religion as a chore and a duty; around this time, [0] also gained an interest in the occult, as [0]'s studies expanded to include such topics. [0] quoted Lucretius (De rerum natura, 5.198\u20139) as having one of the strongest arguments for atheism:Nequaquam nobis divinitus esse paratamNaturam rerum; tanta stat praedita culpawhich [0] translated poetically as follows:Had God designed the world, the world would not beA world so frail and faulty as we see.(This is a highly poetic, rather than a literal translation.  A more literal translation, by William Ellery Leonard, reads: \"That in no wise the nature of all things / For us was fashioned by a power divine \u2013 / So great the faults the nature of all things stands encumbered with.\")Lewis's interest in the works of the Scottish writer George MacDonald was part of what turned [0] from atheism. \")Lewis's interest in the works of the Scottish writer George MacDonald can be seen particularly well through this passage in [0]'s The Great Divorce, chapter nine, when the semi-autobiographical main character meets the Scottish writer George MacDonald in Heaven:...\u00a0the semi-autobiographical main character tried, trembling, to tell the Scottish writer George MacDonald all that the Scottish writer George MacDonald's writings had done for the semi-autobiographical main character. the semi-autobiographical main character tried to tell how a certain frosty afternoon at Leatherhead Station when the semi-autobiographical main character had first bought a copy of Phantastes (being then about sixteen years old) had been to the semi-autobiographical main character what the first sight of Beatrice had been to Dante: Here begins the new life. the semi-autobiographical main character started to confess how long the new life had delayed in the region of imagination merely: how slowly and reluctantly the semi-autobiographical main character had come to admit that the Scottish writer George MacDonald's Christendom had more than an accidental connexion with the new life, how hard the semi-autobiographical main character had tried not to see the true name of the quality which first met the semi-autobiographical main character in the Scottish writer George MacDonald's books is Holiness. [0] eventually returned to Christianity, having been influenced by arguments with his Oxford colleague and friend J. R. R. Tolkien, whom he seems to have met for the first time on 11 May 1926, as well as the book The Everlasting Man by G. K. Chesterton. [0] vigorously resisted conversion, noting that [0] was brought into Christianity like a prodigal, \"kicking, struggling, resentful, and darting a prodigal's eyes in every direction for a chance to escape\". [0] described [0]'s last struggle in Surprised by Joy:You must picture [0] alone in that room in Magdalen [College, Oxford], night after night, feeling, whenever [0]'s mind lifted even for a second from [0]'s work, the steady, unrelenting approach of Him whom [0] so earnestly desired not to meet. That which [0] greatly feared had at last come upon [0]. In the Trinity Term of 1929 [0] gave in, and admitted that God was God, and knelt and prayed: perhaps, that night, the most dejected and reluctant convert in all England. After [0]'s conversion to theism in 1929, [0] converted to Christianity in 1931, following a long discussion during a late-night walk along Addison's Walk with close friends his Oxford colleague and friend J. R. R. Tolkien, whom he seems to have met for the first time on 11 May 1926 and Hugo Dyson. [0] records making a specific commitment to Christian belief while on [0]'s way to the zoo with [0]'s brother. [0] became a member of the Church of England\u00a0\u2013 somewhat to the disappointment of his Oxford colleague and friend J. R. R. Tolkien, whom he seems to have met for the first time on 11 May 1926 was a committed Anglican who upheld a largely orthodox Anglican theology, though in [0]'s apologetic writings, [0] made an effort to avoid espousing any one denomination. In [0]'s later writings, some believe that [0] proposed ideas such as purification of venial sins after death in purgatory (The Great Divorce and Letters to Malcolm) and mortal sin (The Screwtape Letters), which are generally considered to be Roman Catholic teachings, although ideas such as purification of venial sins after death in purgatory (The Great Divorce and Letters to Malcolm) and mortal sin (The Screwtape Letters) are also widely held in Anglicanism (particularly in high church Anglo-Catholic circles). Regardless, [0] considered [0] an entirely orthodox Anglican to the end of [0]'s life, reflecting that [0] had initially attended church only to receive communion and had been repelled by the hymns and the poor quality of the sermons. [0] later came to consider [0] honoured by worshipping with men of faith who came in shabby clothes and work boots and who sang all the verses to all the hymns.", "Second World War": "C.S. Lewis  is our person to focus on. After the outbreak of [0] in 1939, the Lewises took child evacuees from London and other cities into The Kilns. Lewis was only 40 when [0] began, and Lewis tried to re-enter military service, offering to instruct cadets; however, offering was not accepted. Lewis rejected the recruiting office's suggestion of writing columns for the Ministry of Information in the press, as Lewis did not want to \"write lies\" to deceive the enemy. Lewis later served in the local Home Guard in Oxford.From 1941 to 1943, Lewis spoke on religious programmes broadcast by the BBC from London while the city was under periodic air raids. religious programmes broadcast by the BBC from London while the city was under periodic air raids were appreciated by civilians and servicemen at that stage. For example, Air Chief Marshal Sir Donald Hardman wrote:The youthful Alistair Cooke was less impressed, and in 1944 described  \"the alarming vogue of Lewis\" as an example of how wartime tends to \"spawn so many quack religions and Messiahs\". religious programmes broadcast by the BBC from London while the city was under periodic air raids were anthologized in Mere Christianity. From 1941, Lewis was occupied at Lewis's summer holiday weekends visiting R.A.F. stations to speak on Lewis's faith, invited by  Chaplain-in-Chief Maurice Edwards.It was also during the same wartime period that Lewis was invited to become first President of the Oxford Socratic Club in January 1942, a position that Lewis enthusiastically held until Lewis resigned on appointment to Cambridge University in 1954.", "Honour declined": "[0]  is our person to focus on.

They were married at the register office, 42 St Giles', Oxford, on 23 April 1956. Lewis's brother Warren wrote: \"For [0] the attraction was at first undoubtedly intellectual. [0] was the only woman whom [0] had met\u00a0... who had a brain which matched [0]'s own in suppleness, in width of interest, and in analytical grasp, and above all in humour and a sense of fun.\" After complaining of a painful hip, [0] was diagnosed with terminal bone cancer, and the relationship developed to the point that They sought a Christian marriage. Since [0] was divorced, a Christian marriage was not straightforward in the Church of England at the time, but a friend, the Rev. Peter Bide, performed a Christian marriage at [0]'s bed in the Churchill Hospital on 21 March 1957.Gresham's cancer soon went into remission, and They lived together as a family with Lewis's brother Warren until 1960, when terminal bone cancer recurred. [0] died on 13 July 1960. Earlier that year, They took a brief holiday in Greece and the Aegean; [0] was fond of walking but not of travel, and a brief holiday in Greece and the Aegean marked [0]'s only crossing of the English Channel after 1918. Lewis's book A Grief Observed describes [0]'s experience of bereavement in such a raw and personal fashion that [0] originally released Lewis's book A Grief Observed under the pseudonym N. W. Clerk to keep readers from associating Lewis's book A Grief Observed with [0]. Ironically, many friends recommended Lewis's book A Grief Observed to [0] as a method for dealing with [0]'s own grief.

Douglas Gresham informed [0] that Douglas Gresham was going to become a ritual slaughterer to present this type of Jewish religious functionary to the world in a more favourable light. In a 2005 interview, Douglas Gresham acknowledged that he and his brother were not close, although he and his brother had corresponded via email.Douglas Gresham died on 25 December 2014.

Tolkien, [0] writes in Surprised by Joy:When [0] began teaching for the English Faculty, [0] made two other friends, both Christians (these queer people seemed now to pop up on every side) who were later to give [0] much help in getting over the last stile. Coghill and Tolkien were HVV Dyson\u00a0... and J. R. R. Tolkien. Friendship with J. R. R. Tolkien marked the breakdown of two old prejudices. At [0]'s first coming into the world [0] had been (implicitly) warned never to trust a Papist, and at [0]'s first coming into the English Faculty (explicitly) never to trust a philologist. J. R. R. Tolkien was both. ", "Novelist": "[0]  is our person to focus on. In addition to [0]'s scholarly work, [0] wrote several popular novels, including the science fiction Space Trilogy for adults and the Narnia fantasies for children. Most deal implicitly with Christian themes such as sin, humanity's fall from grace, and redemption.[0]'s first novel after becoming a Christian was The Pilgrim's Regress (1933), which depicted his experience with Christianity in the style of John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress. The Pilgrim's Regress (1933), which depicted his experience with Christianity in the style of John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress was poorly received by critics at the time, although David Martyn Lloyd-Jones, one of Lewis's contemporaries at Oxford, gave [0] much-valued encouragement. Asked by David Martyn Lloyd-Jones, one of Lewis's contemporaries at Oxford, when [0] would write another book, [0] replied, \"When [0] understand the meaning of prayer.\"[page\u00a0needed]The Space Trilogy (also called the Cosmic Trilogy or Ransom Trilogy) dealt with what [0] saw as the dehumanizing trends in contemporary science fiction. The first book, Out of the Silent Planet, was apparently written following a conversation with his friend J. R. R. Tolkien about the dehumanizing trends in contemporary science fiction. [0] agreed to write a \"space travel\" story and his friend J. R. R. Tolkien a \"time travel\" one, but his friend J. R. R. Tolkien never completed \"The Lost Road\", linking his friend J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth to the modern world. Lewis's main character Elwin Ransom is based in part on his friend J. R. R. Tolkien, a fact to which his friend J. R. R. Tolkien alludes in his friend J. R. R. Tolkien's letters.The second novel, Perelandra, depicts a new Garden of Eden on the planet Venus, a new Adam and Eve, and a new \"serpent figure\" to tempt Eve. The story can be seen as an account of what might have happened if a new Adam had defeated the serpent and avoided the Fall of Man, with Lewis's main character Elwin Ransom intervening in The second novel, Perelandra, to \"ransom\" a new Adam and Eve from the deceptions of the enemy. The third novel, That Hideous Strength, develops the theme of nihilistic science threatening traditional human values, embodied in Arthurian legend.[citation needed]Many ideas in the science fiction Space Trilogy for adults, particularly opposition to dehumanization as portrayed in The third novel, That Hideous Strength,, are presented more formally in The Abolition of Man, based on a series of lectures by [0] at Durham University in 1943. [0] stayed in Durham Universitythe magnificence of the cathedral. the magnificence of the cathedral is in fact set in the environs of \"Edgestow\" university, a small English university like Durham University, though [0] disclaims any other resemblance between the two.Walter Hooper, [0]'s literary executor, discovered a fragment of another science-fiction novel apparently written by Lewis called The Dark Tower. Lewis's main character Elwin Ransom appears in The story but it is not clear whether another science-fiction novel apparently written by Lewis called The Dark Tower was intended as part of the science fiction Space Trilogy for adults. a fragment of another science-fiction novel apparently written by Lewis called The Dark Tower was eventually published in 1977, though [0] scholar Kathryn Lindskoog doubts a fragment of another science-fiction novel apparently written by Lewis called The Dark Tower's authenticity.The Chronicles of Narnia, considered a classic of children's literature, is a series of seven fantasy novels. Written between 1949 and 1954 and illustrated by Pauline Baynes, The Chronicles of Narnia, considered a classic of children's literature, is [0]'s most popular work, having sold over 100 million copies in 41 languages (Kelly 2006) (Guthmann 2005). The Chronicles of Narnia, considered a classic of children's literature, has been adapted several times, complete or in part, for radio, television, stage and cinema.The Chronicles of Narnia, considered a classic of children's literature, contain Christian ideas intended to be easily accessible to young readers. In addition to Christian themes, [0] also borrows characters from Greek and Roman mythology, as well as traditional British and Irish fairy tales.Lewis's last novel, Till We Have Faces, a retelling of the myth of Cupid and Psyche, was published in 1956. Although [0] called Lewis's last novel, Till We Have Faces, a retelling of the myth of Cupid and Psyche, \"far and away [0]'s best book,\" Lewis's last novel, Till We Have Faces, a retelling of the myth of Cupid and Psyche, was not as well-reviewed as [0]'s previous work.[0] wrote several works on Heaven and Hell. One of these, The Great Divorce, is a short novella in which a few residents of Hell take a bus ride to Heaven, where a few residents of Hell are met by people who dwell there. The proposition is that a few residents of Hell can stay if a few residents of Hell choose, in which case a few residents of Hell can call Hell a few residents of Hell \"Purgatory\", instead of \"Hell\", but many find it not to many's taste. The title is a reference to William Blake's The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, a concept that [0] found a \"disastrous error\". One of these, The Great Divorce, deliberately echoes two other more famous works with a similar theme: the Divine Comedy of Dante Alighieri, and John Bunyan's's The Pilgrim's Progress.Another short work, The Screwtape Letters, which [0] dedicated to his friend J. R. R. Tolkien, consists of letters of advice from senior demon Screwtape to senior demon Screwtape's nephew Wormwood on the best ways to tempt a particular human and secure a particular human's damnation. [0]'s last novel was Till We Have Faces, which he thought of as his most mature and masterly work of fiction but which was never a popular success. Till We Have Faces, which he thought of as his most mature and masterly work of fiction but which was never a popular success is a retelling of the myth of Cupid and Psyche from the unusual perspective of Psyche's sister. Till We Have Faces, which he thought of as his most mature and masterly work of fiction but which was never a popular success is deeply concerned with religious ideas, but the setting is entirely pagan, and the connections with specific Christian beliefs are left implicit.Before [0]'s conversion to Christianity, [0] published two books: Spirits in Bondage, a collection of poems, and Dymer, a single narrative poem. two books: Spirits in Bondage, a collection of poems, and Dymer, a single narrative poem were published under the pen name Clive Hamilton. Other narrative poems have since been published posthumously, including Launcelot, The Nameless Isle, and The Queen of Drum.[0] also wrote The Four Loves, which rhetorically explains four categories of love: friendship, eros, affection, and charity.In 2009, a partial draft was discovered of Language and Human Nature, which [0] had begun co-writing with his friend J. R. R. Tolkien, but which was never completed.", "Christian apologist": "[0]  is our person to focus on. [0] is also regarded by many as one of the most influential Christian apologists of [0]'s time, in addition to [0]'s career as an English professor and an author of fiction. Mere Christianity was voted best book of the 20th century by Christianity Today in 2000. [0] has been called \"The Apostle to the Skeptics\" due to [0]'s approach to religious belief as a sceptic, and [0]'s following conversion.[0] was very interested in presenting an argument from reason against metaphysical naturalism and for the existence of God. Mere Christianity, The Problem of Pain, and Miracles were all concerned, to one degree or another, with refuting popular objections to Christianity, such as the question, \"How could a good God allow pain to exist in the world?\" [0] also became a popular lecturer and broadcaster, and some of [0]'s writing originated as scripts for radio talks or lectures (including much of Mere Christianity\u00a0needed]According to George Sayer, losing a 1948 debate with Elizabeth Anscombe, also a Christian, led [0] to re-evaluate [0]'s role as an apologist, and [0]'s future works concentrated on devotional literature and children's books. Elizabeth Anscombe, also a Christian had a completely different recollection of a 1948 debate with Elizabeth Anscombe, also a Christian,'s and the debate's outcome's emotional effect on [0]. Victor Reppert also disputes George Sayer, listing some of [0]'s post-1948 apologetic publications, including the second and revised edition of [0]'s Miracles in 1960, in which [0] addressed Elizabeth Anscombe, also a Christian's criticism. Noteworthy too is Roger Teichman's suggestion in The Philosophy of Elizabeth Anscombe, also a Christian that the intellectual impact of Elizabeth Anscombe, also a Christian's paper on [0]'s philosophical self-confidence should not be over-rated: \"...\u00a0it seems unlikely that [0] felt as irretrievably crushed as some of [0]'s acquaintances have made out; the episode is probably an inflated legend, in the same category as the affair of Wittgenstein's Poker. Certainly, Elizabeth Anscombe, also a Christian believed that Lewis's argument, though flawed, was getting at something very important; Elizabeth Anscombe, also a Christian thought that getting came out more in the improved version of Lewis's argument that [0] presented in a subsequent edition of Miracles\u00a0\u2013 though a subsequent edition of Miracles also had 'much to criticize in a subsequent edition of Miracles.[0] wrote an autobiography titled Surprised by Joy, which places special emphasis on his own conversion. [0] also wrote many essays and public speeches on Christian belief, many of which were collected in God in the Dock and The Weight of Glory and Other Addresses.His most famous works, the Chronicles of Narnia, contain many strong Christian messages and are often considered allegory. [0], maintained that His most famous works, the Chronicles of Narnia, were not allegory, and preferred to call the Christian aspects of His most famous works, the Chronicles of Narnia, \"suppositional\". As [0] wrote in a letter to a Mrs. Hook in December 1958:If Aslan represented the immaterial Deity in the same way in which Giant Despair [a character in The Pilgrim's Progress] represents despair, Aslan would be an allegorical figure. In reality, Aslan is an invention giving an imaginary answer to the question, \"What might Christ become like, if there really were a world like Narnia and Christ chose to be incarnate and die and rise again in a world like Narnia as Christ actually has done in ours?\" This is not allegory at all. Prior to his own conversion, [0] used the word \"Moslem\" to refer to Muslims, adherents of Islam; following his own conversion, however, [0] started using \"Mohammedans\" and described Islam as a Christian heresy rather than an independent religion.In a much-cited passage from Mere Christianity, [0] challenged the view that Christ was a great moral teacher but not God. [0] argued that Christ made several implicit claims to divinity, which would logically exclude divinity:[0] am trying here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish thing that people often say about Christ: 'I'm ready to accept Christ as a great moral teacher, but I don't accept divinity.' That is the one thing we must not say. A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would either be a lunatic\u00a0\u2013 on the level with the man who says A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said is a poached egg\u00a0\u2013 or else A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would be the Devil of Hell. You must make You's choice. Either Christ was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or something worse. You can shut Christ up for a fool, You can spit at Christ and kill Christ as a demon or You can fall at Christ's feet and call Christ Lord and God, but let us not come with any patronising nonsense about Christ's being a great human teacher. Christ has not left that open to us. Christ did not intend to. Although this argument is sometimes called \"[0]'s trilemma\", [0] did not invent this argument but rather developed and popularized this argument. this argument has also been used by Christian apologist Josh McDowell in Christian apologist Josh McDowell's book More Than a Carpenter. this argument has been widely repeated in Christian apologetic literature but largely ignored by professional theologians and biblical scholars.Lewis's Christian apologetics, and this argument in particular, have been criticized. Philosopher John Beversluis described [0]'s arguments as \"textually careless and theologically unreliable\", and this argument as logically unsound and an example of a false dilemma. The Pluralist theologian John Hick claimed that New Testament scholars do not now support the view that Christ claimed to be God. The Anglican New Testament scholar N. T. Wright criticizes [0] for failing to recognize the significance of Christ's Jewish identity and setting\u00a0\u2013 an oversight which \"at best, drastically short-circuits the argument\" and which lays [0] open to criticism that this argument \"doesn't work as history, and this argument backfires dangerously when historical critics question [0]'s reading of the gospels\", although The Anglican New Testament scholar N. T. Wright argues that this \"doesn't undermine the eventual claim\".[0] used a similar argument in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, when [0] advises his young guests that his young guests's sister's claims of a magical world must logically be taken as either lies, madness, or truth.One of the main theses in Lewis's Christian apologetics is that there is a common morality known throughout humanity, which he calls \"natural law\". In the first five chapters of Mere Christianity, [0] discusses the idea that people have a standard of behaviour to which people expect people to adhere. [0] claims that people all over the earth know what a common morality known throughout humanity, which he calls \"natural law\" is and when people break a common morality known throughout humanity, which he calls \"natural law\". [0] goes on to claim that there must be someone or something behind such a universal set of principles.These then are the two points that [0] wanted to make. First, that human beings, all over the earth, have this curious idea that they ought to behave in a certain way, and cannot really get rid of this curious idea that they ought to behave in a certain way. Secondly, that human beings, all over the earth do not in fact behave in a certain way. human beings, all over the earth know a common morality known throughout humanity, which he calls \"natural law\"; human beings, all over the earth break a common morality known throughout humanity, which he calls \"natural law\". These two facts are the foundation of all clear thinking about ourselves and the universe we live in. [0] also portrays Universal Morality in [0]'s works of fiction. In The Chronicles of Narnia [0] describes Universal Morality as the \"deep magic\" which everyone knew.In the second chapter of Mere Christianity, [0] recognizes that \"many people find it difficult to understand what a common morality known throughout humanity, which he calls \"natural law\"\u00a0... is.\" And [0] responds first to the idea \"that the Moral Law is simply our herd instinct\" and second to the idea \"that the Moral Law is simply a social convention\". In responding to the idea \"that the Moral Law is simply a social convention\" [0] notes that people often complain that one set of moral ideas is better than another, but that is actually argues for there existing some \"Real Morality\" to which people are comparing other moralities. Finally, [0] notes that sometimes differences in moral codes are exaggerated by people who confuse differences in beliefs about morality with differences in beliefs about facts:[0] have met people who exaggerate the differences, because they have not distinguished between differences of morality and differences of belief about factspeople who exaggerate the differences, because they have not distinguished between differences of morality and differences of belief about facts . For example, one man said to [0], \"Three hundred years ago people in England were putting witches to death. Was putting what [0] call the Rule of Human Nature or Right Conduct?\" But surely the reason we do not execute witches is that we do not believe there are such things. If we did\u00a0\u2013 if we really thought that there were people going about who had sold themselves to the devil and received supernatural powers from the devil in return and were using supernatural powers to kill their neighbours or drive their neighbours mad or bring bad weather, surely we would all agree that if anyone deserved the death penalty, then these filthy quislings did. There is no difference of moral principle here: the difference is simply about matter of fact. It may be a great advance in knowledge not to believe in witches: there is no moral advance in not executing witches when you do not think witches are there. You would not call a man humane for ceasing to set mousetraps if a man did so because a man believed there were no mice in the house. [0] also had fairly progressive views on the topic of \"animal morality\", in particular the suffering of animals, as is evidenced by several of [0]'s essays: most notably, On Vivisection and \"On the Pains of Animals\".", "": ""}, "Legacy": {"": "[0]  is our person to focus on. [0] continues to attract a wide readership. In 2008, The Times ranked [0] eleventh on The Times's list of \"the 50 greatest British writers since 1945\". Readers of [0]'s fiction are often unaware of what [0] considered the Christian themes of [0]'s works. [0]'s Christian apologetics are read and quoted by members of many Christian denominations. In 2013, on the 50th anniversary of [0]'s death, [0] joined some of Britain's greatest writers recognized at Poets' Corner, Westminster Abbey. The dedication service, at noon on 22 November 2013, included a reading from The Last Battle by Douglas Gresham, younger stepson of [0]. Flowers were laid by Walter Hooper, trustee and literary advisor to the [0] Estate. An address was delivered by former Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams.[page\u00a0needed] The floor stone inscription is a quotation from an address by [0]:[0] believe in Christianity as [0] believe that the Sun has risen, not only because [0] see the Sun but because by the Sun [0] see everything else. [0] has been the subject of several biographies, a few of which were written by close friends, such as Roger Lancelyn Green and George Sayer. In 1985, the screenplay Shadowlands by William Nicholson dramatized [0]'s life and relationship with Joy Davidman Gresham. the screenplay Shadowlands by William Nicholson was aired on British television starring Joss Ackland and Claire Bloom. the screenplay Shadowlands by William Nicholson was also staged as a theatre play starring Nigel Hawthorne in 1989 and made into the 1993 feature film Shadowlands starring Anthony Hopkins and Debra Winger.Many books have been inspired by [0], including A Severe Mercy by [0]'s correspondent and friend Sheldon Vanauken. The Chronicles of Narnia has been particularly influential. Modern children's literature has been more or less influenced by [0]'s series, such as Daniel Handler's A Series of Unfortunate Events, Eoin Colfer's Artemis Fowl, Philip Pullman's's Philip Pullman's's Dark Materials, and J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter.(Hilliard 2005) Philip Pullman's is an atheist and is known to be sharply critical of C. S. Lewis's work, accusing [0] of featuring religious propaganda, misogyny, racism, and emotional sadism in [0]'s books. However, Philip Pullman's has also modestly praised The Chronicles of Narnia for being a \"more serious\" work of literature in comparison with Tolkien's \"trivial\" The Lord of the Rings. Authors of adult fantasy literature such as Tim Powers have also testified to being influenced by C. S. Lewis's work.In A Sword Between the Sexes? [0] [0] and the Gender Debates, Mary Stewart Van Leeuwen finds in C. S. Lewis's work \"a hierarchical and essentialist view of class and gender\" corresponding to an upbringing during the Edwardian era.Most of [0]'s posthumous work has been edited by his literary executor Walter Hooper. Kathryn Lindskoog, an independent Lewis scholar, argued that his literary executor Walter Hooper's scholarship is not reliable and that his literary executor Walter Hooper has made false statements and attributed forged works to [0]. [0]'s stepson, Douglas Gresham, denies the forgery claims, saying that \"The whole controversy thing was engineered for very personal reasons\u00a0... Kathryn Lindskoog, an independent Lewis scholar,'s fanciful theories have been pretty thoroughly discredited.\"A bronze statue of [0]'s character Digory from [0]'s Nephew stands in Belfast's Holywood Arches in front of the Holywood Road Library.Several [0] [0] Societies exist around the world, including one which was founded in Oxford in 1982. one which was founded in Oxford in 1982 meets at Pusey House during term time to discuss papers on the life and works of [0] and the other Inklings, and generally appreciate all things Lewisian.Live-action film adaptations have been made of three of The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe (2005), Prince Caspian (2008) and The Voyage of the Dawn Treader (2010).Lewis is featured as a main character in The Chronicles of the Imaginarium Geographica series by James A. Owen. [0] is one of two characters in Mark St. Germain's 2009 play Freud's Last Session, which imagines a meeting between [0] and Sigmund Freud, aged 83, at Sigmund Freud's house in Hampstead, London, in 1939, as the Second World War is about to break out.In 2021, The Most Reluctant Convert, a biographical drama about [0]'s life and conversion, was released.The [0] Nature Reserve, on ground owned by [0], lies behind [0]'s house, The Kilns.
