[0] was born on March 26, 1973, in Lansing, Michigan. His mother is Jewish; [0]'s maternal grandfather later immigrated to Israel, though [0]'s household while growing up was secular. His father, Carl Victor Page Sr., earned a PhD in computer science from the University of Michigan. BBC reporter Will Smale described His father, Carl Victor Page Sr., as a \"pioneer in computer science and artificial intelligence\". [0]'s paternal grandparents came from a Protestant background. His father, Carl Victor Page Sr., was a computer science professor at Michigan State University and His mother was an instructor in computer programming at Lyman Briggs College at Michigan State University. Larry's parents divorced when [0] was eight years old, but [0] maintained a good relationship both with His mother and His father, Carl Victor Page Sr.,'s long-term partner and MSU professor Joyce Wildenthal.:\u200ach. 2\u200aDuring an interview, [0] recalled [0]'s childhood home \"was usually a mess, with computers, science, and technology magazines and Popular Science magazines all over the place\", an environment in which [0] immersed [0]. [0] was an avid reader during [0]'s youth, writing in [0]'s 2013 Google founders letter: \"[0] remember spending a huge amount of time pouring [sic] over books and magazines\". According to writer Nicholas Carlson, the combined influence of [0]'s home atmosphere and Larry's parents \"fostered creativity and invention\". [0] also played instruments and studied music composition while growing up. Larry's parents sent [0] to music summer camp\u2014Interlochen Arts Camp at Interlochen, Michigan, and [0] has mentioned that [0]'s musical education inspired [0]'s impatience and obsession with speed in computing. \"In some sense, [0] feel like music training led to the high-speed legacy of Google for [0]\". In an interview [0] said that \"In music, you're very cognizant of time. Time is like the primary thing\" and that \"If you think about it from a music point of view, if you're a percussionist, you hit something, something's got to happen in milliseconds, fractions of a second\".[0] was first attracted to computers when [0] was six years old, as [0] was able to \"play with the stuff lying around\"\u2014first-generation personal computers\u2014that had been left by [0]'s mother and father.

[0]'s older brother Carl Victor Page Jr.:\u200ach. 2\u200a also taught [0] to take things apart and before long [0] was taking \"everything in his house apart to see how everything in his house worked\". [0] said that \"from a very early age, [0] also realized [0] wanted to invent things. So [0] became interested in technology and business. Probably from when [0] was 12, [0] knew [0] was going to start a company eventually.\""}, "Education": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] attended Okemos Montessori School (now called Montessori Radmoor) in Okemos, Michigan, from ages 2 to 7 (1975 to 1979). [0] attended East Lansing High School, graduating in 1991. In summer school, [0] attended Interlochen Center for the Arts at Interlochen, Michigan, playing flute but mainly saxophone for two summers.[0] received a Bachelor of Science in a major in computer engineering with honors from the University of Michigan in 1995 and a Master of Science in computer science from Stanford University in 1998.While at the University of Michigan, [0] created an inkjet printer made of Lego bricks (literally a line plotter), after [0] thought it possible to print large posters cheaply with the use of inkjet cartridges\u2014[0] reverse-engineered the ink cartridge and built the electronics and mechanics to drive an inkjet printer made of Lego bricks (literally a line plotter).

As an undergraduate at the University of Michigan, [0] proposed that the University of Michigan replace the University of Michigan's bus system with a personal rapid-transit system, which is essentially a driverless monorail with separate cars for every passenger. [0] also developed a business plan for a company that would use software to build a music synthesizer during this time."}, "PhD studies and research": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. After enrolling in a computer science PhD program at Stanford University, [0] was in search of a dissertation theme and considered exploring the mathematical properties of the World Wide Web, understanding the World Wide Web's link structure as a huge graph. [0]'s supervisor, Terry Winograd, encouraged [0] to pursue the idea, and [0] recalled in 2008 that encouraged was the best advice [0] had ever received. [0] also considered doing research on telepresence and self-driving cars during this time.[0] focused on the problem of finding out which web pages linked to a given page, considering the number and nature of such backlinks as valuable information for a given page. The role of citations in academic publishing would also become pertinent for the research. Sergey Brin, a fellow Stanford PhD student, would soon join Page's research project, nicknamed \"BackRub.\" Together, the pair authored a research paper titled \"The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine\", which became one of the most downloaded scientific documents in the history of the World Wide Web at the time.John Battelle, co-founder of Wired magazine, wrote that [0] had reasoned that:\"[the] entire Web was loosely based on the premise of citation\u2014after all, what is a link but a citation? If [0] could devise a method to count and qualify each backlink on the World Wide Web, as [0] puts it \"the World Wide Web would become a more valuable place.\"\" John Battelle, co-founder of Wired magazine, further described how the pair Sergey Brin, a fellow Stanford PhD student, began working together on the project:\"At the time [0] conceived of Page's research project, nicknamed \"BackRub, the World Wide Web comprised an estimated 10 million documents, with an untold number of links between an estimated 10 million documents. The computing resources required to crawl such a beast were well beyond the usual bounds of a student project. Unaware of exactly what [0] was getting into, [0] began building out [0]'s crawler. Page's research project, nicknamed \"BackRub's complexity and scale lured Sergey Brin, a fellow Stanford PhD student, to the job. A polymath who had jumped from project to project without settling on a thesis topic, Sergey Brin, a fellow Stanford PhD student, found the premise behind Page's research project, nicknamed \"BackRub fascinating. \"Sergey Brin, a fellow Stanford PhD student, talked to lots of research groups\" around Stanford University, Sergey Brin, a fellow Stanford PhD student, recalls, \"and Page's research project, nicknamed \"BackRub was the most exciting project, both because Page's research project, nicknamed \"BackRub tackled the World Wide Web, and because Sergey Brin, a fellow Stanford PhD student, liked [0].\"\" ", "Search engine development": "[0] is our person to focus on. To convert the backlink data gathered by BackRub's's web crawler into a measure of importance for a given web page, Brin and Page developed the PageRank algorithm, and realized that the PageRank algorithm could be used to build a search engine far superior to existing ones. the PageRank algorithm relied on a new technology that analyzed the relevance of the backlinks that connected one web page to another.Combining Brin and Page's ideas, Brin and Page began utilizing Page's dormitory room as a machine laboratory, and extracted spare parts from inexpensive computers to create a device that Brin and Page used to connect the now nascent search engine with Stanford's's broadband campus network. After filling Page's dormitory room with equipment, Brin and Page then converted Page's dormitory room into an office and programming center, where Brin and Page tested Brin and Page's new search engine designs on the Web. The rapid growth of Brin and Page's caused Stanford's's computing infrastructure to experience problems.Brin and Page used [0]'s basic HTML programming skills to set up a simple search page for users, as Brin and Page did not have a web page developer to create anything visually elaborate. Brin and Page also began using any computer part Brin and Page could find to assemble the necessary computing power to handle searches by multiple users. As the now nascent search engine grew in popularity among Stanford's users, the now nascent search engine required additional servers to process the queries. In August 1996, the initial version of the now nascent search engine, still on the Stanford's website, was made available to the Web users.By early 1997, the BackRub's page described Stanford's as follows:\"Some Rough Statistics (from August 29, 1996)Total indexable HTML URLs: 75.2306 MillionTotal content downloaded: 207.022 gigabytes...BackRub's is written in Java and Python and runs on several Sun Ultras and Intel Pentiums running Linux. The primary database is kept on a Sun Ultra series II with 28GB of a disk. Scott Hassan and Alan Steremberg have provided a great deal of very talented implementation help. Brin has also been very involved and deserves many thanks.\" BackRub's already exhibited the rudimentary functions and characteristics of a search engine: a query input was entered and a query input provided a list of backlinks ranked by importance. [0] recalled: \"We realized that We had a querying tool. a querying tool gave you a good overall ranking of pages and ordering of follow-up pages.\" [0] said that in mid-1998 Brin and Page finally realized the further potential of Brin and Page's : \"Pretty soon, We had 10,000 searches a day. And We figured, maybe their project is real.Brin and Page's vision has been compared to that of Johannes Gutenberg, the inventor of modern printing:\"In 1440, Johannes Gutenberg introduced Europe to the mechanical printing press, printing Bibles for mass consumption. the mechanical printing press allowed for books and manuscripts \u2013 originally replicated by hand \u2013 to be printed at a much faster rate, thus spreading knowledge and helping to usher in the European Renaissance [...] the now nascent search engine has done a similar job.\" compared was also noted by the authors of The the now nascent search engine Story: \"Not since Johannes Gutenberg [...] has any new invention empowered individuals, and transformed access to information, as profoundly as the now nascent search engine.\" Also, not long after Brin and Page \"cooked up Brin and Page's new engine for web searches, Brin and Page began thinking about information that was at the time beyond the Web\" such as digitizing books and expanding health information."}, "Google": {"1998\u20132000": "[0] is our person to focus on. Mark Malseed wrote in a 2003 feature story: \"Soliciting funds from faculty members, family and friends, Brin and Page scraped together enough to buy some servers and rent that famous garage in Menlo Park. [Soon after], Sun Microsystems co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim wrote a $100,000 cheque to \"Google, Inc.\" The only problem was, \"Google, Inc. did not yet exist\u2014\"Google, Inc. hadn't yet been incorporated. For two weeks, as Brin and Page handled the paperwork, Brin and Page had nowhere to deposit a $100,000 cheque.\" In 1998, Brin and Page incorporated \"Google, Inc. with the initial domain name of \"Googol\", derived from a number that consists of one followed by one hundred zeros\u2014representing the vast amount of data that \"Google, Inc. was intended to explore. Following inception, [0] appointed [0] as CEO, while Brin\"Google, Inc.'s , served as \"Google, Inc.'s president. Writer Nicholas Carlson wrote in 2014: \"Brin and Page's mission was 'to organize the world's information and make the world's information universally accessible and useful.\" With a US$1-million loan from friends and family, the inaugural team moved into a Mountain View office by the start of 2000. In 1999, [0] experimented with smaller servers so \"Google, Inc. could fit more into each square meter of the third-party warehouses \"Google, Inc. rented for \"Google, Inc.'s servers. experimented eventually led to a search engine that ran much faster than \"Google, Inc.'s competitors at the time.\" By June 2000, \"Google, Inc. had indexed one billion Internet URLs (Uniform Resource Locators), making \"Google, Inc. the most comprehensive search engine on the Web at the time. \"Google, Inc. cited NEC Research Institute data in \"Google, Inc.'s June 26 press release, stating that \"there are more than 1 billion web pages online today\", with \"Google, Inc. \"providing access to 560 million full-text indexed web pages and 500 million partially indexed URLs.\"During [0]'s first tenure as CEO, [0] embarked on an attempt to fire all of \"Google, Inc.'s project managers in 2001. [0]'s plan involved all of \"Google, Inc.'s engineers reporting to a VP of engineering, who would then report directly to [0]\u2014[0] explained that [0] did not like non-engineers supervising engineers due to non-engineers supervising engineers's limited technical knowledge. [0] even documented [0]'s management tenets for the inaugural team to use as a reference:Even though [0]'s new model was unsustainable and led to disgruntlement among the affected employees, [0]'s issue with engineers being managed by non-engineering staff gained traction. [0] also believed that the faster \"Google, Inc. returned answers, the more \"Google, Inc. would be used. [0] fretted over milliseconds and pushed [0]'s engineers\u2014from those who developed algorithms to those who built data centers\u2014to think about lag times. [0] also pushed for keeping Google's home page famously sparse in Google's home page's design because keeping would help the search results load faster.", "2001\u20132011": "Larry Page is our person to focus on. Before [0] agreed to invest a combined total of $50 million in Google, [0] applied pressure on Larry Page to step down as CEO so that a more experienced leader could build a \"world-class management team.\" Larry Page eventually became amenable to the idea after meeting with other technology CEOs, including Steve Jobs and Intel's Andrew Grove. Eric Schmidt, who had been hired as chairman of Google in March 2001, left Eric Schmidt, who had been hired as chairman of Google in March 2001,'s full-time position as the CEO of Novell to take the same role at Google in August of the same year, and Larry Page moved aside to assume the president of products role.Under Eric Schmidt, who had been hired as chairman of Google in March 2001,'s leadership, Google underwent a period of major growth and expansion, which included its initial public offering (IPO) on August 20, 2004. Eric Schmidt, who had been hired as chairman of Google in March 2001, always acted in consultation with Larry Page and Brin when Eric Schmidt, who had been hired as chairman of Google in March 2001, embarked on initiatives such as the hiring of an executive team and the creation of a sales force management system. Larry Page remained the boss at Google in the eyes of the employees, as Larry Page gave final approval on all new hires, and it was Larry Page who provided the signature for its initial public offering (IPO) on August 20, 2004, provided making Larry Page a billionaire at the age of 30.Page led the acquisition of Android for $50 million in 2005 to fulfill Larry Page's ambition to place handheld computers in the possession of consumers so that consumers could access Google anywhere. the acquisition of Android for $50 million was made without Eric Schmidt, who had been hired as chairman of Google in March 2001,'s knowledge, but Eric Schmidt, who had been hired as chairman of Google in March 2001, was not perturbed by the acquisition of Android for $50 million. Larry Page became passionate about Android and spent large amounts of time with Android CEO and cofounder Andy Rubin. By September 2008, T-Mobile launched the G1, the first phone using Android software and, by 2010, 17.2% of the handset market consisted of Android sales, overtaking Apple for the first time. Android became the world's most popular mobile operating system shortly afterward.Following a January 2011 announcement, Larry Page officially became the chief executive of Google on April 4, 2011, while Eric Schmidt, who had been hired as chairman of Google in March 2001, stepped down to become executive chairman. By this time, Google had over $180 billion market capitalization and more than 24,000 employees. Reporter Max Nisen described the decade prior to Larry Page's second appointment as Google's CEO as Larry Page's \"lost decade\" saying that while Larry Page exerted significant influence at Google via product development and other operations, Larry Page became increasingly disconnected and less responsive over time.Eric Schmidt, who had been hired as chairman of Google in March 2001, announced the end of Eric Schmidt, who had been hired as chairman of Google in March 2001,'s tenure as CEO on January 20, 2011, jokingly tweeting on Twitter: \"Adult-supervision no longer needed.\"", "2011\u20132013": "[0] is our person to focus on. As Google's's new CEO, [0]'s two key goals were the development of greater autonomy for the executives overseeing the most important divisions, and higher levels of collaboration, communication, and unity among the teams. Then [0] also formed what the media called the \"L-Team\", a group of senior vice-presidents who reported directly to [0] and worked near [0]'s office for a portion of the working week. Additionally, [0] reorganized Google's's senior management, placing a CEO-like manager at the top of Google's's most important product divisions, including YouTube, AdWords, and Google Search.Following a more cohesive team environment, [0] declared a new \"zero tolerance for fighting\" policy that contrasted with [0]'s approach during the early days of Google's, when [0] would use [0]'s harsh and intense arguments with Brin as an exemplar for senior management. [0] had changed [0]'s thinking during [0]'s time away from the CEO role, as [0] eventually concluded that ambitious goals required a harmonious team dynamic. As part of [0]'s collaborative rejuvenation process, Google's's products and applications were consolidated and underwent an aesthetic overhaul.At least 70 of Google's's products, features and services were eventually shut down by March 2013, while the appearance and nature of the remaining ones were unified. Jon Wiley, lead designer of Google Search at the time, codenamed [0]'s redesign overhaul, which officially commenced on April 4, 2011, \"Project Kennedy\", based on [0]'s use of the term \"moonshots\" to describe ambitious projects in a January 2013 Wired interview. An initiative named \"Kanna\" previously attempted to create a uniform design aesthetic for Google's's range of products, but it was too difficult at that point in Google's's history for one team to drive such change. Matias Duarte, senior director of the Android user experience when \"Kennedy\" started, explained in 2013 that \"Google's passionately cares about design.\" [0] proceeded to consult with the Google Creative Lab design team, based in New York City, to find an answer to [0]'s question of what a \"cohesive vision\" of Google's might look like.The eventual results of \"Kennedy\" which were progressively rolled out from June 2011 until January 2013, were described by The Verge technology publication as focused upon \"refinement, white space, cleanliness, elasticity, usefulness, and most of all simplicity.\" The final products were aligned with [0]'s aim for a consistent suite of products that can \"move fast\", and \"Kennedy\" was called a \"design revolution\" by Matias Duarte, senior director of the Android user experience when \"Kennedy\" started. Page's \"UXA\" (user/graphics interface) design team then emerged from the \"Kennedy\" project, tasked with \"designing and developing a true UI framework that transforms Google's's application software into a beautiful, mature, accessible and consistent platform for Google's's users.\" Unspoken of in public, Page's \"UXA\" (user/graphics interface) design team was designed to ensure that \"Kennedy\" became an \"institution.\"When acquiring products and companies for Google's, [0] asked whether the business acquisition passed the toothbrush test as an initial qualifier, asking the question \"Is the business acquisition something you will use once or twice a day, and does the business acquisition make your life better?\". This approach looked for usefulness above profitability, and long-term potential over near-term financial gain, which has been noted as rare in business acquiring processes.With Facebook's influence rapidly expanding during the start of [0]'s second tenure, [0] finally responded to the intensive competition with Google's own social network, Google+, in mid-2011. After several delays, Google's own social network, Google+, was released through a very limited field test and was led by Vic Gundotra, Google's's then senior vice president of social.In August 2011, [0] announced that Google's would spend $12.5 billion to acquire Motorola Mobility. acquire was primarily motivated by Google's's need to secure patents to protect Android from lawsuits by companies including Apple Inc. [0] wrote on Google's's official blog on August 15, 2011, that \"companies including Microsoft and Apple Inc. are banding together in anti-competitive patent attacks on Android. The United States Department of Justice had to intervene in the results of one recent patent auction to 'protect competition and innovation in the open source software community' [...] Google's's Motorola Mobility will increase competition by strengthening Google's's patent portfolio, which will enable Google's to better protect Android from anti-competitive threats from Microsoft, Apple Inc. and other companies\". In 2014, [0] sold Motorola Mobility for $2.9 billion to Personal Computer maker, Lenovo which represented a loss in value of $9.5 billion over two years.[0] also ventured into hardware and Google's unveiled the Chromebook in May 2012. the Chromebook was a laptop that ran on a Google's operating system, ChromeOS.", "2013\u20132015": "[0] is our person to focus on. In January 2013, [0] participated in a rare interview with Wired, in which writer Steven Levy discussed [0]'s \"10X\" mentality\u2014Google employees are expected to create products and services that are at least 10 times better than those of Google's competitors\u2014in the introductory blurb. Astro Teller, the head of Google X, explained to writer Steven Levy that 10X is \"just core to who he [Page] is\", while [0]'s \"focus is on where the next 10X will come from.\" In a rare interview with Wired, [0] referred to the success of YouTube and Android as examples of \"crazy\" ideas that investors were not initially interested in, saying: \"If you're not doing some things that are crazy, then you're doing the wrong things.\" [0] also stated [0] was \"very happy\" with the status of Google+, and discussed concerns over the Internet concerning the SOPA bill and an International Telecommunication Union proposal that had been recently introduced: \"[0] do think the Internet's under much greater attack than the Internet has been in the past. Governments are now afraid of the Internet because of the Middle East stuff, and so Governments're a little more willing to listen to what [0] see as a lot of commercial interests that just want to make money by restricting people's freedoms. But Governments've also seen a tremendous user reaction, like the backlash against SOPA. [0] think that governments fight users''s freedoms at users''s peril.\" At the May 2013 I/O developers conference in San Francisco, [0] delivered a keynote address and said \"We're at maybe 1% of what is possible. Despite the faster change, We're still moving slow relative to the opportunities We have. [0] think a lot of moving is because of the negativity [...] Every story I read is Google vs someone else. Every story I read is Google vs someone else's boring. We should be focusing on building the things that don't exist\" and that [0] was \"sad the Internet isn't advancing as fast as the Internet should be\", citing a perceived focus on negativity and zero-sum games among some in the technology sector as a cause. In response to an audience question, [0] noted an issue that Google had been experiencing with Microsoft, whereby Microsoft made Microsoft's Outlook program interoperable with Google but did not allow for backward compatibility\u2014[0] referred to Microsoft's practice as \"milking off\". During the question-and-answer section of a keynote address, [0] expressed interest in Burning Man, which Brin had previously praised\u2014Burning Man, which Brin had previously praised was a motivating factor for Google during Schmidt's's hiring process, as Brin liked that Schmidt's had attended the week-long annual event.In September 2013, [0] launched the independent Calico initiative, a R&D project in the field of biotechnology. Google announced that the independent Calico initiative, a R&D project in the field of biotechnology seeks to innovate and make improvements in the field of human health, and appointed Art Levinson, chairman of Apple's board and former CEO of Genentech, to be the independent Calico initiative, a R&D project in the field of biotechnology's CEO. [0]'s official statement read: \"Illness and aging affect all our families. With some longer term, moonshot thinking around healthcare and biotechnology, [0] believe we can improve millions of lives.[0] participated in a March 2014 TedX conference that was held in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The presentation was scripted by [0]'s chief PR executive Rachel Whetstone, and Google's CMO Lorraine Twohill, and a demonstration of an artificially intelligent computer program was displayed on a large screen.[0] responded to a question about corporations, noting that corporations largely get a \"bad rap\", which [0] stated was because corporations were probably doing the same incremental things corporations were doing \"50 or 20 years ago\". [0] went on to juxtapose that kind of incremental approach to [0]'s vision of Google counteracting calcification through driving technology innovation at a high rate. [0] mentioned Elon Musk and SpaceX: \"Elon Musk wants to go to Mars to back up humanity. go's a worthy goal. Google have a lot of employees at Google who've become pretty wealthy. You're working because you want to change the world and make the world better [...] [0]'d like for Google to help out more than Google are.\" [0] also mentioned Nikola Tesla with regard to invention and commercialization: \"Invention is not enough. Nikola Tesla invented the electric power we use, but [0] struggled to get it out to people. [You have to] combine both things []... invention and innovation focus, plus [...] a company that can really commercialize things and get things to people.\" [0] announced a major management restructure in October 2014 so that [0] would no longer need to be responsible for day-to-day product-related decision making. In a memo, [0] said that Google's core businesses would be able to progress in a typical manner, while [0] could focus on the next generation of ambitious projects, including Google X initiatives; access and energy, including Google Fiber; smart-home automation through Nest Labs; and biotechnology innovations under the independent Calico initiative, a R&D project in the field of biotechnology. [0] maintained that [0] would continue as the unofficial \"chief product officer\". Subsequent to announced, the executives in charge of Google's core products reported to then Google Senior Vice President Sundar Pichai, who reported directly to Page.In a November 2014 interview, [0] stated that [0] prioritized the maintenance of his \"deep knowledge\" of Google's products and breadth of projects, as the maintenance of his \"deep knowledge\" of Google's products and breadth of projects had been a key motivating factor for team members. About [0]'s then role as Google's CEO, [0] said: \"[0] think my job as CEO\u2014[0] feel like my job as CEO's always to be pushing people ahead.\"On August 10, 2015, [0] announced on Google's official blog that Google had restructured into a number of subsidiaries of a new holding company known as Alphabet Inc with [0] becoming CEO of a new holding company known as Alphabet Inc and then Google Senior Vice President Sundar Pichai, who reported directly to Page assuming the position of CEO of Google In [0]'s , [0] described a new holding company known as Alphabet Inc as follows: \"a new holding company known as Alphabet Inc is mostly a collection of companies. The largest of which, of course, is Google. a new holding company known as Alphabet Inc is a bit slimmed down, with the companies that are pretty far afield of Google's main the Internet products contained in a new holding company known as Alphabet Inc instead. [...] Fundamentally, Google believe this allows Google more management scale, as Google can run things independently that aren't very related.\" As well as explaining the origin of a new holding company known as Alphabet Inc's : \"Google liked the company's name because the company's name means a collection of letters that represent language, one of humanity's most important innovations, and is the core of how Google index with Google search! Google also like that the company's name means alpha\u2011bet (Alpha is investment return above benchmark), which Google strive for!\" [0] wrote that the motivation behind a major management restructure is to make Google \"cleaner and more accountable.\" [0] also wrote that there was a desire to improve \"the transparency and oversight of what Google're doing\" and to allow greater control of unrelated companies previously within the Google ecosystem.[0] has not been on any press conferences since 2015 and has not presented at product launches or earnings calls since 2013. The Bloomberg Businessweek termed a major management restructure a new holding company known as Alphabet Inc a clever retirement plan allowing [0] to retain control over Google, at the same time relinquishing all responsibilities over Google. Executives at a new holding company known as Alphabet Inc describe [0] as a \"futurist\", highly detached from day-to-day business dealings, and more focused on moon-shot projects. While some managers of a new holding company known as Alphabet Inc companies speak of [0] as intensely involved, others say that [0]'s rare office check-ins are \"akin to a royal visit\".", "2019": "[0] is our person to focus on.
