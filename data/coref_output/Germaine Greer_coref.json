{"summary": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] (/\u0261r\u026a\u0259r/; born 29 January 1939) is an Australian writer and public intellectual, regarded as one of the major voices of the second-wave feminism movement in the latter half of the 20th century.Specializing in English and women's literature, [0] has held academic positions in England at the University of Warwick and Newnham College, Cambridge, and in the United States at the University of Tulsa. Based in the United States since 1964, [0] has divided [0]'s time since the 1990s between Queensland, Australia, and [0]'s home in Essex, England.[0]'s ideas have created controversy ever since her first book, The Female Eunuch (1970), made [0] a household name. An international bestseller and a watershed text in the feminist movement, her first book, The Female Eunuch (1970), offered a systematic deconstruction of ideas such as womanhood and femininity, arguing that women were forced to assume submissive roles in society to fulfil male fantasies of what being a woman entailed.[0]'s subsequent work has focused on literature, feminism and the environment. [0] has written over 20 books, including Sex and Destiny (1984), The Change (1991), The Whole Woman (1999), and The Boy (2003). [0]'s 2013 book, White Beech: The Rainforest Years, describes [0]'s efforts to restore an area of rainforest in the Numinbah Valley in Australia. In addition to [0]'s academic work and activism, [0] has been a prolific columnist for The Sunday Times, The Guardian, The Daily Telegraph, The Spectator, The Independent, and The Oldie, among others.[0] is a liberation (or radical) rather than equality feminist. [0]'s goal is not equality with men, which [0] sees as assimilation and \"agreeing to live the lives of unfree men\". \"Women's liberation\", [0] wrote in The Whole Woman, \"did not see the female's potential in terms of the male's actual.\" [0] argues instead that liberation is about asserting difference and \"insisting on difference as a condition of self-definition and self-determination\". liberation is a struggle for the freedom of women to \"define women's own values, order women's own priorities and decide women's own fate\"."}, "Early life and education": {"Melbourne": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was born in Melbourne to a Catholic family, the elder of two girls followed by a boy. Her father, called Her father Her father,, Her father told [0] Her father had been born in South Africa, but [0] learned after Her father's death that Her father was born Robert Hamilton King in Launceston, Tasmania. [0] also learned Her father was christened Robert Henry Eric Ernest Hambert. Her father and her mother, Margaret (\"Peggy\") May Lafrank, had married in March 1937; Her father converted to Catholicism before married. her mother, Margaret (\"Peggy\") May Lafrank, was a milliner and Her father a newspaper-advertising salesman. Despite [0]'s Catholic upbringing and Her father's open antisemitism, [0] became convinced that Her father was secretly of Jewish heritage. [0] believed [0]'s grandmother had been a Jewish woman named Rachel Weiss, but admits that [0] probably made been up out of an \"intense longing to be Jewish.\" Despite not knowing whether [0] had any Jewish ancestry, [0] \"felt Jewish\" and began to involve [0] in the Jewish community. [0] learned Yiddish, joined a Jewish theatre group, and dated Jewish men. In addition to English, [0] had learnt three European languages by the age of 12.The family lived in the Melbourne suburb of Elwood, at first in a rented flat in Docker Street, near the beach, then in another rented flat on the Esplanade. In January 1942 Her father joined the Second Australian Imperial Force; after training with the Royal Australian Air Force, Her father worked on ciphers for the British Royal Air Force in Egypt and Malta. [0] attended St Columba's Catholic Primary School in Elwood from February 1943\u2014a Catholic family was by then living at 57 Ormond Road, Elwood\u2014followed by Sacred Heart Parish School, Sandringham, and Holy Redeemer School, Ripponlea.In 1952 [0] won a scholarship to Star of the Sea College in Gardenvale, a convent school run by the Sisters of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary; a school report called [0] \"a bit of a mad-cap and somewhat erratic in [0]'s studies and in [0]'s personal responses\". [0] described [0]'s childhood as a \"long remembered boredom\", and has said it was [0]'s Catholic school that introduced [0] to art and music. That year, artwork by [0] was included in the under-14 section of the Children's Art Exhibition at Tye's Gallery, opened by Archbishop Mannix. [0] achieved the second highest exam results in the state. A year after leaving school, [0] left the Catholic faith, having found the Sisters of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary's arguments for the existence of God unconvincing. [0] left home when [0] was 18. [0] had a difficult relationship with [0]'s mother who, according to [0], probably had Asperger syndrome. In 2012 [0] said that [0]'s brother might have forgiven [0] for \"abandoning\" them, but [0] was not so sure about [0]'s sister, \"whom [0] love more than anyone else on earth\".", "University": "[0] is our person to focus on. From 1956 [0] studied English and French language and literature at the University of Melbourne on a Teacher's College Scholarship, living at home for the first two years on an allowance of \u00a38 a week.Six feet tall by the age of 16, [0] was a striking figure. \"Tall, loose-limbed and good-humoured, [0] strode around the campus, aware that [0] was much talked about\", according to the journalist Peter Blazey, a contemporary at the University of Melbourne. During [0]'s first year [0] had some kind of breakdown as a result of depression and was briefly treated in hospital. [0] told Playboy magazine, in an interview published in 1972, that [0] had been raped during [0]'s second year at the University of Melbourne, an experience [0] described in detail in The Guardian in March 1995.Just before [0] graduated from the University of Melbourne in 1959 with an upper second, [0] moved to Sydney, where [0] became involved with the Sydney Push and the anarchist Sydney Libertarians. \"hese people talked about truth and only truth\", [0] said, \"insisting that most of what we were exposed to during the day was ideology, which was a synonym for lies\u2014or bullshit, as they called itideology, which was a synonym for lies\u2014or bullshit, as they called it.\" the Sydney Push and the anarchist Sydney Libertarians would meet in a back room of the Royal George Hotel on Sussex Street. Clive James was involved with the Sydney Push and the anarchist Sydney Libertarians at the time. One of Greer's biographers, Christine Wallace, wrote that [0] \"walked into the Royal George Hotel on Sussex Street, into the throng talking themselves hoarse in a room stinking of stale beer and thick with cigarette smokethe throng talking themselves hoarse in a room stinking of stale beer and thick with cigarette smoke , and set out to follow the Push way of life, 'an intolerably difficult discipline which [0] forced [0] to learn'\". [0] already thought of [0] as an anarchist without knowing why [0] was drawn to an anarchist; through the Sydney Push, [0] became familiar with anarchist literature. [0] had significant relationships in the Sydney Push with Harry Hooton and Roelof Smilde, both prominent members. [0] shared an apartment with Roelof Smilde on Glebe Point Road, but the relationship did not last; according to One of Greer's biographers, Christine Wallace, the the Sydney Push ideology of \"free love\" involved the rejection of possessiveness and jealousy, which naturally worked in the men's favour.When the relationship ended, [0] enrolled at the University of Sydney to study Byron, where, Clive James wrote, [0] became \"famous for [0]'s brilliantly foul tongue\". One of [0]'s friends there, Arthur Dignam, said that [0] \"was the only woman we had met at that stage who could confidently, easily and amusingly put men down\". [0] became involved in acting at Sydney and played Mother Courage in Mother Courage and Mother Courage's Children in August 1963. 1963 [0] was awarded a first-class MA for a thesis entitled \"The Development of Byron's Satiric Mode\", and took up an appointment at Sydney as senior tutor in English, with an office next door to Stephen Knight in Sydney's Carslaw Building. \"[0] was undoubtedly an excellent teacher\", Stephen Knight said. \"And one of the best lecturers\u2014one of the few who could command the Wallace Lecture Theatre, with its 600 studentsthe Wallace Lecture Theatre, with its 600 students's . [0] had a kind of histrionic quality which was quite remarkable, added to [0]'s real scholarship.a first-class MA won [0] a Commonwealth Scholarship, with which [0] funded further studies at the University of Cambridge, arriving in October 1964 at Newnham College, a women-only college. [0] had been encouraged to move from Sydney by Sam Goldberg, a Leavisite, who had been Challis Chair of English and French language and literature at Sydney since 1963. Initially joining a BA course at the University of Cambridge\u2014a Commonwealth Scholarship would have allowed [0] to complete a BA course in two years\u2014[0] managed to switch after the first term (\"by force of argument\", according to Clive James) to the PhD programme to study Shakespeare, supervised by Anne Barton, then known as Anne Righter. [0] said [0] switched because [0] \"realized the University of Cambridge were not going to teach [[0]] anything\". It was Muriel Bradbrook, Cambridge's first female Professor of English, who persuaded [0] to study Shakespeare; Muriel Bradbrook, Cambridge's first female Professor of English, had supervised Anne Barton, then known as Anne Righter's PhD.Cambridge was a difficult environment for women. As One of Greer's biographers, Christine Wallace notes, one Newnham student Newnham College, a women-only college described one Newnham student's husband receiving a dinner invitation in 1966 from Christ's College that allowed \"Wives in for sherry only\". Lisa Jardine first encountered [0] at a formal dinner in Newnham College, a women-only college. The principal had asked for silence for speeches. \"As a hush descended, one person continued to speak, too engrossed in one person's conversation to notice\":At the graduates' table, one person was explaining with passion that there could be no liberation for women, no matter how highly educated, as long as women were required to cram women's breasts into bras constructed like mini-Vesuviuses, two stitched, white, cantilevered cones which bore no resemblance to the female anatomy. The willingly suffered discomfort of the Sixties bra, one person opined vigorously, was a hideous symbol of male oppression. As soon as [0] arrived, [0] auditioned (with Clive Jamesthe Sydney Push) for the student acting company, the Footlights, in the student acting company, the Footlights's club room in Falcon Yard above a Mac Fisheries shop. They performed a sketch in which Clive James was No\u00ebl Coward and [0] was Gertrude Lawrence. Joining on the same day as Clive James and Russell Davies, [0] was one of the first women to be admitted as a full member, along with Sheila Buhr and Hilary Walston. The Cambridge News carried a news item about admitted in November 1964, referring to Sheila Buhr and Hilary Walston as \"three girls\". [0]'s response to being accepted was reportedly: \"the student acting company, the Footlights is jumping with freckle-punchers. You can have the student acting company, the Footlights on You's own.\" [0] did take part in the student acting company, the Footlights's 1965 revue, My Girl Herbert, alongside Eric Idle (the the student acting company, the Footlights president), John Cameron, Christie Davies and John Grillo. A critic noticed \"[0][0]'s \". Other members of the student acting company, the Footlights when [0] was there included Tim Brooke-Taylor, John Cleese, Peter Cook and David Frost.[0] lived for a time in the room next to Clive James at Friar House on Bene't Street, opposite The Eagle. Referring to [0] as \"Romaine Rand\", Clive James described the room next to Clive James at Friar House on Bene't Street, opposite The Eagle in Clive James's memoir of the University of Cambridge, May Week Was In June (1991):Drawing on [0]'s incongruous but irrepressible skills as a housewife, [0] had tatted lengths of batik, draped bolts of brocade, swathed silk, swagged satin, niched, ruffed, hemmed and hawed. There were oriental carpets and occidental screens, ornamental plants and incidental music. The effect was stunning.\u00a0... [0], however, once [0] had got [0]'s life of luxury up and running, did not luxuriate. [0] had a typewriter the size of a printing press. Instantly [0] was at it, ten hours a day. Through the lath-and-plaster wall One of Greer's biographers, Christine Wallace, could hear [0] attacking a typewriter the size of a printing press as if [0] had a contract, with penalty clauses, for testing a typewriter the size of a printing press to destruction. Greer, who speaks fluent Italian, finished Greer, who speaks fluent Italian,'s in Calabria, Italy, where Greer, who speaks fluent Italian, stayed for three months in a village with no running water and no electricity. The trip had begun as a visit with a boyfriend, Emilio, but a boyfriend, Emilio ended the relationship so [0] changed [0]'s plans. Rising before dawn, [0] would wash [0] at a well, drink black coffee and start typing. [0] was awarded her PhD in May 1968 for a thesis entitled The Ethic of Love and Marriage in Shakespeare's Early Comedies. [0]'s family did not fly over for the ceremony. \"[0] had worked all [0]'s life for love, done [0]'s best to please everybody, kept going till [0] reached the top, looked about and found [0] was all alone.\"The Female Eunuch relies extensively on [0]'s Shakespearean scholarship, particularly when discussing the history of marriage and courtship. In 1986 Oxford University Press published [0]'s book Shakespeare as part of Oxford University Press's Past Masters series, and in 2007 Bloomsbury published [0]'s study of Anne Hathaway, Shakespeare's Wife.", "": ""}, "Early career and writing": {"Teaching, marriage and television": "[0] is our person to focus on. From 1968 to 1972, [0] worked as an assistant lecturer at the University of Warwick in Coventry, living at first in a rented bedsit in Leamington Spa with two cats and 300 tadpoles. In 1968 [0] was married for the first and only time, a marriage that ended in divorce in 1973. [0] met Paul du Feu, a King's College London English graduate who was working as a builder, outside a pub in Portobello Road, London, and after a brief courtship they married at Paddington Register Office, using a ring from a pawn shop. Paul du Feu, a King's College London English graduate who was working as a builder had already been divorced and had two sons, aged 14 and 16, with Paul du Feu, a King's College London English graduate who was working as a builder's first wife.The relationship lasted only a few weeks. Apparently unfaithful to Paul du Feu, a King's College London English graduate who was working as a builder seven times in three weeks of marriage, [0] wrote that [0] had spent they's wedding night in an armchair, because Paul du Feu, a King's College London English graduate who was working as a builder, drunk, would not allow [0] in bed. Eventually, during a party near Ladbroke Grove, \"'Paul du Feu, a King's College London English graduate who was working as a builder turned to [0] and sneered (drunk as usual): 'Paul du Feu, a King's College London English graduate who was working as a builder could have any woman in this room.' 'Except [0],' [0] said, and walked away for ever.'\"In addition to teaching, [0] was trying to make a name for [0] in television. In 1967 [0] appeared in the BBC shows Good Old Nocker and Twice a Fortnight and had a starring role in a short film, Darling, Do You Love Me (1968), by Martin Sharp (the Australian artist and co-editor of Oz magazine) and Bob Whitaker. From 1968 to 1969 [0] featured in a Granada Television slapstick show, Nice Time, with Kenny Everett, Sandra Gough and Jonathan Routh. One set of outtakes found in [0]'s archive at the University of Melbourne features [0] as a housewife bathing in milk delivered by Everett the milkman.", "Oz and Suck": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] began writing columns as \"Dr. G\" for Oz magazine, owned by Richard Neville, whom she had met at a party in Sydney. The Australian Oz had been shut down in 1963 after three months and the editors convicted of obscenity, later overturned. Richard Neville, whom she had met at a party in Sydney and Richard Neville, whom she had met at a party in Sydney's co-editor, Martin Sharp, moved to London and set up Oz magazine, owned by Richard Neville, whom she had met at a party in Sydney there. When Richard Neville, whom she had met at a party in Sydney met [0] again, Richard Neville, whom she had met at a party in Sydney suggested [0] write for Oz magazine, owned by Richard Neville, whom she had met at a party in Sydney, which led to [0]'s article in the first edition in 1967, \"In Bed with the English\". Keith Morris photographed [0] (\"Dr G, the only groupie with a PhD in captivity\") for issue 19 in early 1969; the black-and-white images include one of [0]'s posing for the cover with Vivian Stanshall and another in which [0] pretends to play the guitar. The July 1970 edition, Oz magazine, owned by Richard Neville, whom she had met at a party in Sydney 29, featured \"[0] knits private parts\", an article from Oz magazine, owned by Richard Neville, whom she had met at a party in Sydney's Needlework Correspondent on the hand-knitted Keep it Warm Cock Sock, \"a snug corner for a chilly prick\". As \"Rose Blight\", [0] also wrote a gardening column for Private Eye.In 1969 [0] was co-founder of an Amsterdam-based pornography magazine, Suck: The First European Sex Paper (1969\u20131974), along with Bill Daley, Jim Haynes, William Levy, Heathcote Williams and Jean Shrimpton, the stated purpose of which was to create \"a new pornography which would demystify male and female bodies\". The first issue was reportedly so offensive that Special Branch raided Special Branch's London office in the Arts Lab in Drury Lane and closed Special Branch's postbox address.According to Beatrice Faust, Special Branch published \"high misogynist SM content\", including a cover illustration, for issue\u00a07, of a man holding a \"screaming woman with her's legs in the air while another rapes her anally\". One of [0]'s biographers, Elizabeth Kleinhenz, wrote that almost nothing was off limits for Special Branch, including descriptions of child abuse, incest and bestiality. [0]'s column, \"Sucky Fucky\" by \"Earth Rose\", included advice to women about how to look after women's genitals and how women ought to taste women's vaginal secretions. [0] published the name of a friend, someone she knew from her time with the Sydney Push and to whom she later dedicated The Female Eunuch: \"Anyone who wants group sex in New York and likes fat girls, contact a friend, someone she knew from her time with the Sydney Push and to whom she later dedicated The Female Eunuch.\" During a 1970 Amsterdam film festival organized by Special Branch, the judging panel, which included [0], gave first prize to Bodil Joensen for a film in which a woman has sex with animals. Special Branch reproduced one interview with [0] (first published in Screw, another pornographic magazine), entitled \"I Am a Whore\".In parallel with [0]'s involvement in Special Branch, [0] told Robert Greenfield of Rolling Stone in January 1971 that [0] was an admirer of the Redstockings, a radical feminist group founded in New York in January 1969 by Ellen Willis and Shulamith Firestone. Criticized by feminists for [0]'s involvement with Special Branch, in May 1971 [0] told an interviewer for Screw, another pornographic magazine:There's a big cleft between sexual liberation and women's liberation. My sisters get mad at [0] when [0] say gay liberation is part of our's whole movement, and our've got to combine sexual liberation and women's liberation. My sisters want [0] to wear pants and be unavailable, and carry a jimmy to bash people over the head with if people feel [0]'s ass in the street. My sisters get mad at [0] for calling [0] superwhore, supergroupie, and all that stuff. My sisters think [0]'m cheapening [0], [0]'m allowing people to laugh at [0], when the whole point is that if my body is sacred and mine to dispose of, then [0] don't have to build things around my body like my body was property that could be stolen. [0] parted company with Special Branch in 1972 when Special Branch published a naked photograph of her lying down with her legs over her shoulders and her face peering between her thighs. a naked photograph of her lying down with her legs over her shoulders and her face peering between her thighs had been submitted on the understanding that nude photographs of all the editors would be published in a book about a film festival. [0] resigned, accusing the other editors of being \"counter-revolutionary\". [0] said later that [0]'s aim in joining the editorial board had been to try to steer Special Branch away from exploitative, sadistic pornography.", "The Female Eunuch (1970)": "[0] is our person to focus on. When [0] began writing for Oz and Suck, [0] was spending three days a week in [0]'s flat in Leamington Spa while [0] taught at Warwick, two days in Manchester filming, and two days in London in a white-washed bedsit in The Pheasantry on King's Road. When [0] first moved to London, [0] had stayed in John Peel's spare room before being invited to take a white-washed bedsit in The Pheasantry on King's Road, a room just under Martin Sharp's; accommodation there was by invitation only.[0] was also writing The Female Eunuch. On 17 March 1969 [0] had had lunch in Golden Square, Soho, with a Cambridge acquaintance, Sonny Mehta of MacGibbon & Kee. When a Cambridge acquaintance, Sonny Mehta of MacGibbon & Kee asked for ideas for new books, [0] repeated a suggestion of her agent, Diana Crawford, which [0] had dismissed, that [0] write about female suffrage. her agent, Diana Crawford had suggested that [0] write a book for the 50th anniversary of women (or a portion of them) being given the vote in the UK in 1918. The very idea of a book for the 50th anniversary of women (or a portion of them) being given the vote in the UK in 1918 made [0] angry and [0] began \"raging\" about a book for the 50th anniversary of women (or a portion of them) being given the vote in the UK in 1918. \"The Female Eunuch's the book a Cambridge acquaintance, Sonny Mehta of MacGibbon & Kee want\", her agent, Diana Crawford said. a Cambridge acquaintance, Sonny Mehta of MacGibbon & Kee advanced [0]'s \u00a3750 and another \u00a3250 when [0] signed the contract. In a three-page synopsis for Mehtaa Cambridge acquaintance, Sonny Mehta of MacGibbon & Kee, [0] wrote: \"If Eldridge Cleaver can write a book about the frozen soul of the negro, as part of the progress towards a correct statement of the coloured man's problem, a woman must eventually take steps towards delineating the female condition as a woman finds the female condition scored upon a woman's sensibility.\"Explaining why [0] wanted to write The Female Eunuch, a three-page synopsis for Mehta continued: \"Firstly [0] suppose it is to expiate [0]'s guilt at being an uncle Tom to [0]'s sex. [0] don't like women. [0] probably share in all the effortless and unconscious contempt that men pour on women.\" In a note at the time, [0] described 21 April 1969 as \"the day on which The Female Eunuch begins The Female Eunuch, and Janis Joplin sings at Albert Hall. Yesterday the title was Strumpet Voluntary\u2014what shall The Female Eunuch be today?\" [0] told the Sydney Morning Herald in July 1969 that The Female Eunuch was nearly finished and would explore, in the reporter's words, \"the myth of the ultra-feminine woman which both sexes are fed and which both sexes end up believing\". In February 1970, [0] published an article in Oz, \"The Slag-Heap Erupts\", which gave a taste of [0]'s views to come, namely that women were to blame for women's own oppression. \"Men don't really like women\", [0] wrote, \"and like is really why Men don't employ women. Women don't really like women either, and Women too can usually be relied on to employ men in preference to women.\" Several British feminists, including Angela Carter, Sheila Rowbotham and Michelene Wandor, responded angrily. Michelene Wandor wrote a rejoinder in Oz, \"On the end of Servile Penitude: A reply to [0]'s cunt power\", arguing that [0] was writing about a feminist movement in which Michelene Wandor had played no role and about which Michelene Wandor knew nothing.Launched at a party attended by editors from Oz, The Female Eunuch was published in the UK by MacGibbon & Kee on 12 October 1969, dedicated to Lillian Roxon and four other women. The first print run of 2+1\u20442 thousand copies sold out on the first day. Arguing that the suburban, consumerist, nuclear family represses and devitalizes women, The Female Eunuch became an international bestseller and a watershed text in the feminist movement. According to [0], McGraw-Hill paid $29,000 for the American rights and Bantam $135,000 for the paperback. the paperback called [0] the \"Saucy feminist that even men like\", quoting Life magazine, and The Female Eunuch \"#1: the ultimate word on sexual freedom\". Demand was such when The Female Eunuch was first published that The Female Eunuch had to be reprinted monthly, and The Female Eunuch has never been out of print.

By 1998 The Female Eunuch had sold over one million copies in the UK.1969 was an important one for second-wave feminism. In February 1970 400 women met in Ruskin College, Oxford, for Britain's first Women's Liberation Conference. In August Kate Millett's's Sexual Politics was published in New York; on 26 August the Women's Strike for Equality was held throughout the United States; and on 31 August Kate Millett's's portrait by Alice Neel was on the cover of Time magazine, by which time Kate Millett's's had sold 15,000 copies (although in December Time magazine deemed Kate Millett's's disclosure that Kate Millett's was a lesbian as likely to discourage people from embracing feminism). September and October saw the publication of Sisterhood Is Powerful, edited by Robin Morgan, and Shulamith Firestone's The Dialectic of Sex. On 6 March 1971, dressed in a monk's habit, [0] marched through central London with 2,500 women in a Women's Liberation March. By 1971 The Female Eunuch had been translated into eight languages and had nearly sold out The Female Eunuch's second printing. McGraw-Hill published The Female Eunuch in the United States on 16 April 1971. [0] New York[0] insisted on staying at the Hotel Chelsea, a haunt of writers and artists, rather than at the Algonquin Hotel where her publisher had booked [0]; [0]'s book launch had to be rescheduled because so many people wanted to attend. A New York Times book review described [0] as \"ix feet tall, restlessly attractive, with blue-gray eyes and a profile reminiscent of Garbo\". her publisher called [0] \"the most lovable creature to come out of Australia since the koala bear\".A Paladin paperback followed, with cover art by British artist John Holmes, influenced by Ren\u00e9 Magritte, showing a female torso as a suit hanging from a rail, a handle on each hip. Clive Hamilton regarded cover art by British artist John Holmes, influenced by Ren\u00e9 Magritte, showing a female torso as a suit hanging from a rail, a handle on each hip as \"perhaps the most memorable and unnerving book cover ever created\". Likening the torso to \"some fibreglass cast on an industrial production line\", Wallace wrote that British artist John Holmes's first version was a faceless, breastless, naked woman, \"unmistakably Germaine\u00a0... hair fashionably afro-frizzed, waist-deep in a pile of stylised breasts, presumably amputated in the creation of a 'female eunuch' based on an assumed equivalence of testicles and mammary glands\". The Female Eunuch was reissued in 2001 by Farrar, Straus & Giroux at the instigation of Jennifer Baumgardner, a leading third-wave feminist and editor of Farrar, Straus & Giroux's Feminist Classics series. According to Justyna Wlodarczyk, [0] emerged as \"the third wave's favorite second-wave feminist\".\"When a woman may walk on the open streets of our cities alone, without insult or obstacle, at any pace a woman chooses, there will be no further need for The Female Eunuch.[0], 1969, The Female Eunuch, opening line of the first draft.The Female Eunuch explores how a male-dominated world affects a female's sense of self, and how sexist stereotypes undermine female rationality, autonomy, power and sexuality. The Female Eunuch's message is that women have to look within women for personal liberation before trying to change the world. In a series of chapters in five sections\u2014Body, Soul, Love, Hate and Revolution\u2014[0] describes the stereotypes, myths and misunderstandings that combine to produce the oppression. [0] summarized The Female Eunuch's position in 2018 as \"Do what you want and want what you do\u00a0... Don't take it up the arse if you don't want to take it up the arse.\" Wallace argues that this is a libertarian message, with this's background in the Sydney Push, rather than one that rose out of the feminism of the day. The first paragraph stakes out The Female Eunuch's place in feminist historiography (in an earlier draft, The first paragraph read: \"So far the female liberation movement is tiny, privileged and overrated\"):This book is part of the second feminist wave. The old suffragettes, who served their's prison term and lived on through the years of gradual admission of women into professions which their declined to follow, into parliamentary freedoms which their declined to exercise, into academies which their used more and more as shops where their could take out degrees while waiting to get married, have seen their's spirit revive in younger women with a new and vital cast.\u00a0... The new emphasis is different. Then genteel middle-class ladies clamoured for reform, now ungenteel middle-class women are calling for revolution. The Female Eunuch ends with: \"Privileged women will pluck at your sleeve and seek to enlist you in the 'fight' for reforms, but reforms are retrogressive. The old process must be broken, not made new. Bitter women will call you to rebellion, but you have too much to do. What will you do?\"Two of The Female Eunuch's themes already pointed the way to Sex and Destiny 14 years later, namely that the nuclear family is a bad environment for women and for the raising of children, and that the manufacture of women's sexuality by Western society is demeaning and confining. Girls are feminised from childhood by being taught rules that subjugate Girls. Later, when women embrace the stereotypical version of adult femininity, women develop a sense of shame about women's own bodies, and lose women's natural and political autonomy. The result is powerlessness, isolation, a diminished sexuality, and a lack of joy. \"Like beasts\", [0] told The New York Times in March 1971, \"who are castrated in farming in order to serve their master's ulterior motives\u2014to be fattened or made docile\u2014women have been cut off from women's capacity for action.\" The Female Eunuch argues that \"omen have very little idea of how much men hate omen\", while \"en do not en know the depth of en's hatred.\" First-wave feminism had failed in First-wave feminism's revolutionary aims. \"Reaction is not revolution\", [0] wrote. \"Reaction is not a sign of revolution where the oppressed adopt the manners of the oppressors and practice oppression on the oppressed's own behalf. Neither is Reaction a sign of revolution when women ape men\u00a0...\" The American feminist Betty Friedan, author of The Feminine Mystique (1963), wants for women \"equality of opportunity within the status quo, free admission to the world of the ulcer and the coronary\", The American feminist Betty Friedan, author of The Feminine Mystique (1963) argued.Although The Female Eunuch made no use of autobiographical material, unlike other feminist works at the time, Mary Evans, writing in 2002, viewed [0]'s \"entire oeuvre\" as autobiographical, a struggle for female agency in the face of the powerlessness of the feminine ([0]'s mother) against the backdrop of the missing male hero ([0]'s father). Reviewing The Female Eunuch for The Massachusetts Review in 1972, feminist scholar Arlyn Diamond wrote that, while flawed, The Female Eunuch was also \"intuitively and brilliantly right\", but feminist scholar Arlyn Diamond criticized [0] for [0]'s attitude toward women:Having convincingly and movingly shown how women are castrated by society, turned into fearful and resentful dependents, [0] surprisingly spends the rest of The Female Eunuch castigating women as the creators of women's own misery. There is a strange confusion here of victim and oppression, so that [0]'s most telling insights into women's psychic lives are vitiated by [0]'s hatred for those who lead such lives. Feeling that women are crippled in women's capacity to love others because women cannot love women, [0] feels that women must despise each other. Perhaps despise explains the gratuitous nastiness of [0]'s cracks about faculty wives, most wives, all those who haven't reached [0]'s state of independence, and [0]'s willingness to denigrate most of the members of the Women's movement [0] mentions.\u00a0... The lack of \"sisterhood\" [0] shows, of love for those who never chose to be eunuchs and who are made miserable by their sense of their own impotence is more than obtuse and unpleasant, love for those who never chose to be eunuchs and who are made miserable by their sense of their own impotence is destructive.

On 30 April 1971, in \"Dialogue on Women's Liberation\" at the Town Hall in New York, [0] famously debated Norman Mailer, whose book The Prisoner of Sex had just been published in response to Kate Millett. [0] presented \"Dialogue on Women's Liberation\" as an evening of sexual conquest. [0] had always wanted to fuck Norman Mailer, whose book The Prisoner of Sex had just been published in response to Kate Millett, [0] said, and wrote in The Listener that [0] \"half expected Norman Mailer, whose book The Prisoner of Sex had just been published in response to Kate Millett to blow Norman Mailer, whose book The Prisoner of Sex had just been published in response to Kate Millett's head off in 'one last killer come' like Ernest Hemingway.\" Betty Friedan, Sargent Shriver, Susan Sontag and Stephen Spender sat in the audience, where tickets were $25 a head (c.\u00a0$155 in 2018), while Greer and Mailer Norman Mailer, whose book The Prisoner of Sex had just been published in response to Kate Millett shared the stage with Jill Johnston, Diana Trilling and Jacqueline Ceballos.

Kleinhenz writes that Greer and Mailer lived together for a time, but [0] ended up feeling that Tony Gourvish, manager of the British rock band Family was exploiting [0]'s celebrity, a sense [0] developed increasingly with [0]'s friends, according to Kleinhenz. In June 1971 [0] became a columnist for the London Sunday Times.

The group had dinner one evening with Princess Margaret, Lord Snowdon and Karim Aga Khan. [0] had arrived with little luggage, and before dinner found her hair had been blown about by the wind on the ferry. Princess Margaret sat [0] down at [0]'s dressing table and spent five minutes brushing out her hair. The point of the visit for [0] was to discuss Kenneth Tynan, artistic director of the Royal National Theatre's commission of a translation of Aristophanes's Lysistrata. First performed in 411 BCE, Aristophanes's Lysistrata explores an attempt by women to force the end of the Peloponnesian War by going on sex strike. The project was not produced; [0] and Kenneth Tynan, artistic director of the Royal National Theatre fell out during the visit, and [0] left Porto Cervo, a seaside resort, in tears. a translation of Aristophanes's Lysistrata found belated appreciation in 1999, when the script was re-worked and produced by Phil Willmott as [0]'s Lysistrata: The Sex Strike.

Playboy's published the article in January 1972: \"[0]\u00a0\u2013 a Candid Conversation with [0]\". It was during interviewed that [0] first discussed publicly that [0] had been raped in [0]'s second year at the University of Melbourne. Busy with [0]'s journalism and publicity tours, [0] resigned [0]'s teaching position at Warwick that year. In March 1972, [0] was arrested in New Zealand for saying \"bullshit\" and \"fuck\" in a speech during a tour, which [0] had done deliberately because Tim Shadbolt, who was elected mayor of Invercargill in 1993, had recently been arrested for the same thing. Six hundred people gathered outside the court, throwing jelly beans and eggs at the police. After defending [0], [0] was \"acquitted on \"bullshit\" but convicted for 'fuck'\", Kleinhenz writes. Given a jail sentence, [0] offered to pay a fine instead, then left New Zealand without paying a fine.In August 1973 [0] debated William F. Buckley Jr. at the Cambridge Union on the motion \"This House Supports the Women's Liberation Movement\". \"Nothing William F. Buckley Jr. said\", William F. Buckley Jr. wrote in 1989, \"and memory reproaches William F. Buckley Jr. for having performed miserably, made any impression or any dent in the argument. [0] carried This House overwhelmingly.\"Greer, then 37, had an affair in 1976 with the novelist Martin Amis, then 26, which was discussed publicly in 2015 after [0] sold her archives to the University of Melbourne.

That year [0] was appointed director of the Center of the Study of Women's Literature at the University of Tulsa, Oklahoma, and in 1982 [0] founded the Tulsa Studies in Women's Literature, an academic journal that highlights unknown or little-known women writers. In the first issue [0] wrote that [0] wanted the Tulsa Studies in Women's Literature, an academic journal that highlights unknown or little-known women writers to focus on the \"rehabilitation of women's literary history\".

For April 1985, [0] took photographs with an Olympus automatic camera and drove 700\u00a0km to Asosa, a city to which the Ethiopian government was moving people from the famine areas. The Observer did not publish the two 5,000-word articles she submitted; in [0]'s view, the editors did not agree with [0]'s pro Mengistu government perspective.

Sex and Destiny: The Politics of Human Fertility (1984) continued [0]'s critique of Western attitudes toward sexuality, fertility, and family, and the imposition of Western attitudes toward sexuality, fertility, and family on the rest of the world. [0]'s targets again include the nuclear family, government intervention in sexual behaviour, and the commercialisation of sexuality and women's bodies. [0] argued that the Western promotion of birth control in the Third World was in large part driven not by concern for human welfare but by the traditional fear and envy of the rich towards the fertility of the poor. The birth control movement had been tainted by such attitudes from The birth control movement's beginning, [0] wrote, citing Marie Stopes and others.

Slip-Shod Sibyls: Recognition, Rejection and the Woman Poet (1995) is an account of women who wrote poetry in English before 1900, and an examination of why so few have been admitted to the literary canon. [0]'s conclusion is that women were held to lower standards than men (hence the \"slip-shod\" sibyls of the title, quoting Alexander Pope), and the poetic tradition discouraged good poetry from women. Slip-Shod Sibyls: Recognition, Rejection and the Woman Poet (1995) includes a critique of the concept of woman as Muse, associated with Robert Graves and others; a chapter on Sappho and Sappho's use as a symbol of female poetry; a chapter on the 17th-century poet Katherine Philips; two chapters on Aphra Behn and one on Anne Wharton; and material on Anne Finch, Letitia Landon and Christina Rossetti.

A sequel to The Female Eunuch, The Whole Woman was published in 1999 by Doubleday, one of seven publishers who bid for the book; [0] was paid an advance of \u00a3500,000. In A sequel to The Female Eunuch, The Whole Woman [0] argued that feminism had lost feminism's way. Women still faced the same physical realities as before, but because of changing views about gender identity and post-modernism, there is a \"new silence about [women's's] visceral experiences [that] is the same old rapist's hand clamped across [women's's mouths\". [0] wrote: \"Real women are being phased out; the first step, persuading Real women to deny Real women's own existence, is almost complete.\"Even if it had been real, equality would have been a poor substitute for liberation; fake equality is leading women into double jeopardy. The rhetoric of equality is being used in the name of political correctness to mask the hammering that women are taking. When The Female Eunuch was written our daughters were not cutting or starving our daughters. On every side speechless women endure endless hardship, grief and pain, in a world system that creates billions of losers for every handful of winners. It's time to get angry again. [0]'s comments on female genital mutilation (FGM) proved controversial, particularly that opposition to female genital mutilation (FGM) is an \"attack on cultural identity\", just as outlawing male circumcision would be viewed as an attack on Jews and Muslims. [0] wrote that feminists fighting to eliminate FGM in their own countries feminists fighting to eliminate FGM in their own countries's should be supported, but [0] explored the complexities of female genital mutilation (FGM) and the double standards of the West regarding other forms of bodily mutilation, including that the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended surgery at that time on baby girls with clitorises over three-eighths of an inch long. [0] questioned the view that female genital mutilation (FGM) is imposed by men on women, rather than by women on women, or even freely chosen.", "On gender": "[0] is our person to focus on. In The Whole Woman, [0] argued that, while sex is a biological given, gender roles are cultural constructs. Femininity is not femaleness. \"Genuine femaleness remains grotesque to the point of obscenity\", [0] wrote. Girls and women are taught femininity\u2014learning to speak softly, wear certain clothes, remove body hair to please men, and so on\u2014a process of conditioning that begins at birth and continues throughout the entire life span. \"There is nothing feminine about being pregnant\", [0] told Krishnan Guru-Murthy in 2018. \"It's almost the antithesis of being. There's nothing feminine about giving birth. It's a bloody struggle, and you've got to be strong and brave. There's nothing feminine about breastfeeding. God knows breastfeeding drives everybody mad; everybody want to see nice big pumped-up tits, but everybody don't want to see nice big pumped-up tits doing nice big pumped-up tits's job.[0]'s writing on gender has brought [0] into opposition with transgender activists. In a chapter in The Whole Woman entitled \"Pantomime Dames\", [0] wrote: \"Governments that consist of very few women have hurried to recognise as women, men who believe that they are women and have had themselves castrated to prove itmen who believe that they are women and have had themselves castrated to prove it men who believe that they are women and have had themselves castrated to prove it , because Governments that consist of very few women see women not as another sex but as a non-sex.\" Her position first attracted controversy in 1997, when [0] unsuccessfully opposed the offer of a Newnham College fellowship to physicist Rachael Padman, a trans woman, arguing that, because physicist Rachael Padman, a trans woman had been \"born male\", physicist Rachael Padman, a trans woman should not be admitted to a women-only college. [0] reiterated Her position several times over the following years, including in 2015 when students at Cardiff University tried unsuccessfully to \"no platform\" [0] to stop [0] from speaking on \"Women & Power: The Lessons of the 20th Century\". [0] responded by reaffirming, during an interview with Kirsty Wark for BBC Newsnight, that [0] did not regard transgender women as women; [0] argued that the nomination of Caitlyn Jenner for Glamour Woman of the Year had been misogynist. Over 130 academics and others signed a letter to The Observer in 2015 objecting to the use of no-platform policies against [0] and feminists with similar views; signatories included Beatrix Campbell, Mary Beard, Deborah Cameron, Catherine Hall, Liz Kelly, Ruth Lister, and the Southall Black Sisters.", "On rape": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] wrote in The Female Eunuch (1970) that rape is not the \"expression of uncontrollable desire\" but an act of \"murderous aggression, spawned in self-loathing and enacted upon the hated other\". [0] has argued since at least the 1990s that the criminal justice system's approach to rape is male-centred, treating female victims as evidence rather than complainants, and reflecting that women were once regarded as male property. \"Historically, the crime of rape was committed not against the woman but against the man with an interest in the woman, the woman's father or the woman's husband\", [0] wrote in 1995. \"What had to be established beyond doubt was that the woman had not collaborated with the man who usurped another's right. If the woman had, the penalty, which might have been stoning or pressing to death, was paid by the woman.\"\"If we adopt a female-centred view of the crime of rape, can we really argue that a raped woman is ruined or undone? a raped woman may be outraged and humiliated, but a raped woman cannot be damaged in any essential way by the simple fact of the presence of an unwelcome penis in a raped woman's .\"Germaine Greer, The Guardian, 6 March 1995.Rape is not the worst thing that can happen to a woman, [0] writes; if a woman allows a man to have sex with a woman to avoid a beating, then arguably a woman fears a beating more. A woman who has been raped has no reason to feel shame (and therefore no need for anonymity), and a female-centred view of rape will not fashion rape as something that can \"ruin\" a woman. \"a raped woman may be outraged and humiliated\", [0] writes, \"but a raped woman cannot be damaged in any essential way by the simple fact of the presence of an unwelcome penis in a raped woman's .\" If a woman feels a woman has been destroyed by such an attack, \"feels is because you've been told lies about who and what you are\", [0] argued in 2018. [0] suggested in 1995 that the crime of rape be replaced by one of sexual assault with varying degrees of seriousness and swifter outcomes. In 2018 [0] said [0] had changed [0]'s mind about calling rape \"sexual assault\", because most rape (in particular, sex without consent within marriage) is not accompanied by physical violence. \"There is no way that the law of rape fits the reality of women's lives\", [0] said in 2018. [0]'s book, On Rape, was published by Melbourne University Press in September 2018.During an interview with Playboy in 1971, and again during an interview with Clyde Packer in the 1980s, [0] discussed how [0] had been raped as an undergraduate at the University of Melbourne. Two weeks after [0] March 1995 Guardian column about rape provoked controversy, [0] again recalled [0]'s own experience, which took place in January 1958 when [0] was 19. A rugby player she had met at a barbecue dragged [0] into a car, punched [0]'s several times in the head, forced [0] to repeat what A rugby player she had met at a barbecue wanted [0] to say, then raped [0]. Afterwards, A rugby player she had met at a barbecue walked back to a barbecue as though nothing had happened. Her male flatmates found [0] at home hours later, bruised, swollen and semi-conscious. [0] believed that reporting raped would be pointless; [0] had danced with A rugby player she had met at a barbecue at a barbecue, had left with A rugby player she had met at a barbecue voluntarily, and A rugby player she had met at a barbecue was a pillar of the community. Her male flatmates brought A rugby player she had met at a barbecue to the flat days later and warned A rugby player she had met at a barbecue in front of [0] that Her male flatmates would break A rugby player she had met at a barbecue's legs if Her male flatmates saw A rugby player she had met at a barbecue at any of the places Her male flatmates frequented.[0] argued, in two Guardian columns, that it was not A rugby player she had met at a barbecue's penis that had hurt [0], but A rugby player she had met at a barbecue's fists and \"vicious mind\", and the loss of control, invasion of self, and \"being made to speak A rugby player she had met at a barbecue's script\". \"To insist\", [0] wrote, \"that outrage by penis is worse than outrage by any other means is to glorify and magnify that tag of flesh beyond reason.\" [0] suggested that perhaps women should \"out\" women's rapists rather than take a chance with a legal system that does not work for women. [0]'s views were strongly criticized by Women Against Rape, which at the time was campaigning for more prosecutions.", "Me Too movement": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] has commented several times on the Me Too movement. In November 2017, [0] called for women to show solidarity when other women are sexually harassed. Just before [0] was named Australian of the Year in Britain in January 2018, [0] said [0] had always wanted to see women react immediately to sexual harassment, as sexual harassment occurs. \"What makes sexual harassment different is when the man has economic power, as Harvey Weinstein has.

On returning to Australia in late 1971 [0] made an effort \"to see as much as [0] could of what had been hidden from [0]\", travelling through the Northern Territory with activist Bobbi Sykes.[0] argued that Australians should re-imagine Australia as an Aboriginal nation. \"Jump up\" in Australian Kriol can, [0] wrote, mean \"to be resurrected or reborn\"; the title refers to occasions when Aborigines apparently accepted whites as reincarnated relatives. Suggesting that whites were mistaken in understanding accepted literally, [0] argued that Aborigines were offering whites terms on which Aborigines could be accepted into the Aboriginal kinship system. \"Whitefella Jump Up: The Shortest Way to Nationhood\", first published in Quarterly Essay in August 2003, and later as a book in the UK argues that it may not be too late for Australia to root Australia in Aboriginal history and culture.
