In 1984, [0] contributed recipes to a Native American cookbook and identified [0] as Cherokee.During [0]'s first Senate race in 2012, [0]'s opponent, Scott Brown, speculated that [0] had fabricated Native ancestry to gain advantage on the employment market and used [0]'s ancestry in several attack ads.

A 2018 Boston Globe investigation found that her reported ethnic status played no role in [0]'s rise in the academic legal profession, and concluded there was \"clear evidence, in documents and interviews, that her reported ethnic status was never considered by the Harvard Law faculty, which voted resoundingly to hire [0], or by those who hired [0] to four prior positions at other law schools\", and that \"[0] was viewed as a white woman by the hiring committees at every institution that employed [0]\".

Bustamante that found [0]'s ancestry to be mostly European but \"strongly support[ed] the existence of an unadmixed Native American ancestor\", likely \"in the range of 6 to 10 generations ago\". Other geneticists, while not disputing the test's's validity, found the underlying science \"flawed\" due to the lack of Native Americans in the United States in the database. Geneticists Krystal Tsosie and Matthew Anderson called the interpretation of the test \"problematic\", citing, among other reasons, \"[0]'s motives, and the genetic variants informing the comparison\". Geneticists Krystal Tsosie and Matthew Anderson added: \"because geneticist Carlos D. Bustamante used Indigenous individuals from Central and South America as a reference group to compare [0]'s DNA, Geneticists Krystal Tsosie and Matthew Anderson believe geneticist Carlos D. Bustamante should have stated only that [0] potentially had an 'Indigenous' ancestor 6-10 generations ago, not conclusively a 'Native American' one. The distinction might seem hypercritical to most, but to the sovereign tribal nations of the United States The distinction's an important one.\"After publicizing the interpretation of the test, [0] asked his to donate the money to the National Indigenous Women's Resource Center. his responded: \"his didn't say that. his think [0] better read the test's again\". The Cherokee Nation called the use of DNA testing to determine Native American heritage \"inappropriate and wrong\".

In 2004, Warren and her daughter, Amelia Tyagi, wrote The Two-Income Trap: Why Middle-Class Mothers and Fathers Are Going Broke. In The Two-Income Trap: Why Middle-Class Mothers and Fathers Are Going Broke Warren and her daughter, Amelia Tyagi, state that at that time, a fully employed worker earned less inflation-adjusted income than a fully employed worker had 30 years earlier. Although families spent less at that time on clothing, appliances, and other forms of consumption, the costs of core expenses such as mortgages, health care, transportation, and child care had increased dramatically. According to Warren and her daughter, Amelia Tyagi,, the result was that even families with two income earners were no longer able to save and incurred ever greater debt.In an article in The New York Times, Jeff Madrick said of The Two-Income Trap: Why Middle-Class Mothers and Fathers Are Going Broke: Warren and her daughter, Amelia Tyagi, find that it is not the free-spending young or the incapacitated elderly who are declaring bankruptcy so much as families with children\u00a0... Warren and her daughter, Amelia Tyagi,'s main thesis is undeniable. Typical families often cannot afford the high-quality education, health care, and neighborhoods required to be middle class today. More clearly than anyone else, Jeff Madrick think, Warren and her daughter, Amelia Tyagi, have shown how little attention the nation and our government have paid to the way Americans really live.  In 2005, Warren and David Himmelstein published a study on bankruptcy and medical bills that found that half of all families filing for bankruptcy did so in the aftermath of a serious medical problem. Warren and David Himmelstein say that three-quarters of such families had medical insurance. a study on bankruptcy and medical bills that found that half of all families filing for bankruptcy did so in the aftermath of a serious medical problem was widely cited in policy debates, but some have challenged a study on bankruptcy and medical bills that found that half of all families filing for bankruptcy did so in the aftermath of a serious medical problem's methods and offered alternative interpretations of the data, suggesting that only 17% of bankruptcies are directly attributable to medical expenses.Metropolitan Books published Warren's book A Fighting Chance in April 2014. According to a Boston Globe review, \"Warren's book A Fighting Chance's title refers to a time [0] says is now gone, when even families of modest means who worked hard and played by the rules had at a fair shot at the American dream.\"In April 2017, [0] published [0]'s 11th book, This Fight Is Our Fight: The Battle to Save America's Middle Class, in which [0] explores the plight of America's Middle Class and argues that our government needs to do more to help working families with stronger social programs and increased investment in education."}}
