[0]'s maternal great-grandfather, Abe Grady, emigrated from Ennis, County Clare, Ireland. DNA testing performed in 2018 showed that, through [0]'s paternal grandmother, [0] was a descendant of the former slave Archer Alexander, who had been chosen from the building crew as the model of a freed man for the Emancipation Memorial, and was the subject of abolitionist William Greenleaf Eliot's book, The Story of Archer Alexander: From Slavery to Freedom. Like [0], Archer Alexander fought for Archer Alexander's freedom.the 19th-century Republican politician and staunch abolitionist Cassius Marcellus Clay, also from the state of Kentucky was a sign and billboard painter, and his mother, Odessa O'Grady Clay (1917\u20131994), was a domestic helper. Although the 19th-century Republican politician and staunch abolitionist Cassius Marcellus Clay, also from the state of Kentucky was a Methodist, the 19th-century Republican politician and staunch abolitionist Cassius Marcellus Clay, also from the state of Kentucky allowed his mother, Odessa O'Grady Clay (1917\u20131994), to bring up both [0] and [0]'s younger brother, Rudolph \"Rudy\" Clay (later renamed Rahman Ali), as Baptists.

Initially, [0] did not take up Louisville police officer and boxing coach Joe E. Martin, who encountered the 12-year-old fuming over a thief's having taken his bicycle's offer, but after seeing amateur boxers on a local television boxing program called Tomorrow's Champions, [0] was interested in the prospect of fighting. [0] then began to work with trainer Fred Stoner, whom [0] credits with giving [0] the \"real training\", eventually molding \"[0]'s style, [0]'s stamina and [0]'s system.\" For the last four years of [0]'s amateur career [0] was trained by boxing cutman Chuck Bodak.[0] made [0]'s amateur boxing debut in 1954 against local amateur boxer Ronnie O'Keefe.

[0] made [0]'s professional debut on October 29, 1960, winning a six-round decision over Tunney Hunsaker. From then until the end of 1963, [0] amassed a record of 19\u20130 with 15 wins by knockout. [0] defeated boxers including Tony Esperti, Jim Robinson, Donnie Fleeman, Alonzo Johnson, George Logan, Willi Besmanoff, LaMar Clark, Doug Jones, and Henry Cooper. [0] also beat his former trainer and veteran boxer Archie Moore in a 1962 match.These early fights were not without trials. [0] was knocked down by both Sonny Banks and Henry Cooper. In the Henry Cooper fight, [0] was floored by a left hook at the end of round four and was saved by the bell, going on to win in the predicted fifth round due to Henry Cooper's severely cut eye. The fight with Doug Jones on March 13, 1963, was [0]'s toughest fight during this stretch. The number two and three heavyweight contenders respectively, The number two and three heavyweight contenders respectively fought on Doug Jones's home turf at New York's Madison Square Garden. Doug Jones staggered [0] in the first round, and the unanimous decision for [0] was greeted by boos and a rain of debris thrown into the ring. Watching on closed-circuit TV, heavyweight champ Sonny Liston quipped that if heavyweight champ Sonny Liston fought [0] heavyweight champ Sonny Liston might get locked up for murder. The fight with Doug Jones on March 13, 1963 was later named \"Fight of the Year\" by The Ring magazine.In each of These early fights, [0] vocally belittled [0]'s opponents and vaunted [0]'s abilities. [0] called Doug Jones \"an ugly little man\" and Henry Cooper a \"bum\". [0] said [0] was embarrassed to get in the ring with Alex Miteff and claimed that New York's Madison Square Garden was \"too small for [0].\" [0]'s trash talk was inspired by professional wrestler \"Gorgeous George\" Wagner's's, after [0] saw professional wrestler \"Gorgeous George\" Wagner's's talking ability attract huge crowds to events. [0] stated in a 1969 interview with the Associated Press' Hubert Mizel that [0] met with professional wrestler \"Gorgeous George\" Wagner's in Las Vegas in 1961, that professional wrestler \"Gorgeous George\" Wagner's told [0] that talking a big game would earn paying fans who either wanted to see [0] win or wanted to see [0] lose, thus [0] transformed [0] into a self-described \"big-mouth and a bragger\".In 1960, [0] left his former trainer and veteran boxer Archie Moore's camp, partially due to [0]'s refusal to do chores such as washing dishes and sweeping. To replace his former trainer and veteran boxer Archie Moore, [0] hired Angelo Dundee to be [0]'s trainer. [0] had met Angelo Dundee in February 1957 during [0]'s amateur career. Around this time, [0] sought longtime idol Sugar Ray Robinson to be [0]'s manager, but was rebuffed.", "World heavyweight champion": "[0] is our person to focus on. By late 1963, [0] had become the top contender for Sonny Liston's's title. The fight was set for February 25, 1964, in Miami Beach. Sonny Liston's was an intimidating personality, a dominating fighter with a criminal past and ties to the mob. Based on [0]'s uninspired performance against Jones and Cooper in [0]'s previous two fights, and Sonny Liston's's destruction of former heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson in two first-round knockouts, [0] was a 7\u20131 underdog. Despite was, [0] taunted Sonny Liston's during the pre-fight buildup, dubbing Sonny Liston's \"the big ugly bear\", stating \"Sonny Liston's even smells like a bear\" and claiming \"After [0] beat Sonny Liston's [0]'m going to donate Sonny Liston's to the zoo.\" [0] turned the pre-fight weigh-in into a circus, shouting at Sonny Liston's that \"someone is going to die at ringside tonight.\" [0]'s pulse rate was measured at 120, more than double [0]'s normal 54. Many of those in attendance thought [0]'s behavior stemmed from fear, and some commentators wondered if [0] would show up for The fight.The outcome of The fight was a major upset. At the opening bell, Sonny Liston's rushed at [0], seemingly angry and looking for a quick knockout. However, [0]'s superior speed and mobility enabled [0] to elude Sonny Liston's, making Sonny Liston's miss and look awkward. At the end of the first round, [0] opened up [0]'s attack and hit Sonny Liston's repeatedly with jabs. Sonny Liston's fought better in round two, but at the beginning of the third round [0] hit Sonny Liston's with a combination that buckled Sonny Liston's's knees and opened a cut under Sonny Liston's's left eye. This was the first time Sonny Liston's had ever been cut. At the end of round four, [0] was returning to [0]'s corner when [0] began experiencing blinding pain in his eyes and asked his trainer, Angelo Dundee, to cut off his gloves. his trainer, Angelo Dundee, refused. It has been speculated that blinding pain in his eyes was due to ointment used to seal Sonny Liston's's cuts, perhaps deliberately applied by Sonny Liston's's corner to Sonny Liston's's . Though unconfirmed, boxing historian Bert Sugar said that two of Liston's opponents also complained about two of Liston's opponents's eyes \"burning\".Despite Sonny Liston's's attempts to knock out [0], [0] was able to survive the fifth round until sweat and tears rinsed the irritation from [0]'s eyes. In the sixth, [0] dominated, hitting Sonny Liston's repeatedly. Sonny Liston's did not answer the bell for the seventh round, and [0] was declared the winner by TKO. Sonny Liston's stated that the reason Sonny Liston's quit was an injured shoulder. Following the win, [0] rushed to the edge of the ring and, pointing to the ringside press, shouted: \"Eat your words!\" [0] added, \"[0] am the greatest! [0] shook up the world. [0]'m the prettiest thing that ever lived.\"At ringside post fight, [0] appeared unconvinced that The fight was stopped due to a Liston shoulder injury, saying that the only injury Sonny Liston's had was \"an open eye, a big cut eye!\" When told by Joe Louis that a Liston shoulder injury was a \"left arm thrown out of its socketa \"left arm thrown out of its socket's ,\" [0] quipped, \"Yeah, swinging at nothing, who wouldn't?\"In winning The fight at the age of 22, [0] became the youngest boxer to take the title from a reigning heavyweight champion. However, former heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson remained the youngest to win the title, doing so at the age 21 during an elimination bout following Rocky Marciano's retirement. Mike Tyson broke both records in 1986 when Mike Tyson defeated Trevor Berbick to win the title at age 20. The feat also made [0] the fastest boxer to the win championship (non-vacant) in the modern era, doing so in 20 bouts.Soon after The fightSonny Liston's , [0] changed [0]'s name to Cassius X, and then later to Muhammad Ali upon converting to Islam and affiliating with Islam. Muhammad Ali then faced a rematch with Liston scheduled for May 1965 in Lewiston, Maine. a rematch with Liston scheduled for May 1965 in Lewiston, Maine had been scheduled for Boston the previous November, but was postponed for six months due to Muhammad Ali's emergency surgery for a hernia three days before. a rematch with Liston scheduled for May 1965 in Lewiston, Maine was controversial. Midway through the first round, Sonny Liston's was knocked down by a difficult-to-see blow the press dubbed a \"phantom punch\". Referee Jersey Joe Walcott did not begin the count immediately after knocked, as Muhammad Ali refused to retreat to a neutral corner. Sonny Liston's rose after Sonny Liston's had been down for about 20 seconds, and a rematch with Liston scheduled for May 1965 in Lewiston, Maine momentarily continued. However a few seconds later Referee Jersey Joe Walcott, having been informed by the timekeepers that Sonny Liston's had been down for a count of 10, stopped a rematch with Liston scheduled for May 1965 in Lewiston, Maine and declared Muhammad Ali the winner by knockout. a rematch with Liston scheduled for May 1965 in Lewiston, Maine lasted less than two minutes.It has since been speculated that Sonny Liston's purposely dropped to the ground. Proposed motivations include threats on Sonny Liston's's life from Islam, that Sonny Liston's had bet against Sonny Liston's and that Sonny Liston's \"took a dive\" to pay off debts. Slow-motion replays show that Sonny Liston's was jarred by a chopping right from Ali, although it is unclear whether a chopping right from Ali was a genuine knockout punch.Muhammad Ali defended Muhammad Ali's against former heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson on November 22, 1965. Before The fight, Muhammad Ali mocked former heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson former heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson former heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson's as an \"Uncle Tom\", calling former heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson \"The Rabbit\". Although Muhammad Ali clearly had the better of former heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson, The fight lasted 12 rounds before being called on a technical knockout. former heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson later said former heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson had strained former heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson's sacroiliac. Muhammad Ali was criticized in the sports media for appearing to have toyed with former heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson during The fight. Patterson biographer W. K. Stratton claims that the conflict between Ali and Patterson former heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson was not genuine but was staged to increase ticket sales and the closed-circuit viewing audience, with Ali and Patterson complicit in the theatrics. Patterson biographer W. K. Stratton also cites an interview by Howard Cosell in which Muhammad Ali explained that rather than toying with former heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson, Muhammad Ali refrained from knocking former heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson out after it became apparent former heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson was injured. former heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson later said that former heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson had never been hit by punches as soft as Muhammad Ali's. Patterson biographer W. K. Stratton states that Muhammad Ali arranged the second fight, in 1972, with former heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson to help former heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson earn enough money to pay a debt to the IRS.After The fightformer heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson , Muhammad Ali founded his own promotion company, Main Bout. his own promotion company, Main Bout mainly handled Muhammad Ali's boxing promotions and pay-per-view closed-circuit television broadcasts. his own promotion company, Main Bout's stockholders were mainly fellow Islam members, along with several others, including Bob Arum.Muhammad Ali and then-WBA heavyweight champion boxer Ernie Terrell had agreed to meet for a bout in Chicago on March 29, 1966 (WBA had stripped Muhammad Ali of Muhammad Ali's following Muhammad Ali's joining Islam). But in February Muhammad Ali was reclassified by the Louisville draft board as 1-A from 1-Y, and Muhammad Ali indicated that Muhammad Ali would refuse to serve, commenting to the press, \"Muhammad Ali ain't got nothing against no Viet Cong; no Viet Cong never called Muhammad Ali nigger.\", although the second part is probably apocryphal. Amidst the media and public outcry over Muhammad Ali's stance, the Illinois Athletic Commission refused to sanction The fight, citing technicalities.Instead, Muhammad Ali traveled to Canada and Europe and won championship bouts against George Chuvalo, Henry Cooper, Brian London, and Karl Mildenberger.Muhammad Ali returned to the United States to fight Cleveland Williams at the Astrodome in Houston on November 14, 1966. fight drew a record-breaking indoor crowd of 35,460 people. Cleveland Williams had once been considered among the hardest punchers in the heavyweight division, but in 1964 Cleveland Williams had been shot at point-blank range by a Texas policeman, resulting in the loss of one kidney and 3.0 metres (10\u00a0ft) of Cleveland Williams's small intestine. Muhammad Ali dominated Cleveland Williams, winning a third-round technical knockout in what some consider the finest performance of Muhammad Ali's career.Muhammad Ali fought then-WBA heavyweight champion boxer Ernie Terrell in Houston on February 6, 1967. then-WBA heavyweight champion boxer Ernie Terrell was billed as Muhammad Ali's toughest opponent since Sonny Liston's; then-WBA heavyweight champion boxer Ernie Terrell was big, strong and had a three-inch reach advantage over Muhammad Ali. During the lead up to The fight, then-WBA heavyweight champion boxer Ernie Terrell repeatedly called Muhammad Ali \"Clay\", much to Muhammad Ali's annoyance. Ali and Patterson almost came to blows over the name issue in a pre-fight interview with Howard Cosell. Muhammad Ali seemed intent on humiliating then-WBA heavyweight champion boxer Ernie Terrell. \"Muhammad Ali want to torture then-WBA heavyweight champion boxer Ernie Terrell\", Muhammad Ali said. \"A clean knockout is too good for then-WBA heavyweight champion boxer Ernie Terrell.\" The fight was close until the seventh round, when Muhammad Ali bloodied then-WBA heavyweight champion boxer Ernie Terrell and almost knocked then-WBA heavyweight champion boxer Ernie Terrell out. In the eighth round, Muhammad Ali taunted then-WBA heavyweight champion boxer Ernie Terrell, hitting then-WBA heavyweight champion boxer Ernie Terrell with jabs and shouting between punches, \"What's my name, Uncle Tom ... what's my name?\" Muhammad Ali won a unanimous 15-round decision. then-WBA heavyweight champion boxer Ernie Terrell claimed that early in The fight Muhammad Ali deliberately thumbed then-WBA heavyweight champion boxer Ernie Terrell in the eye, forcing then-WBA heavyweight champion boxer Ernie Terrell to fight half-blind, and then, in a clinch, rubbed the eye against the ropes. Because of Muhammad Ali's apparent intent to prolong The fight to inflict maximum punishment, critics described fight as \"one of the ugliest boxing fights.\" Tex Maule later wrote: \"fight was a wonderful demonstration of boxing skill and a barbarous display of cruelty.\" Muhammad Ali denied the accusations of cruelty but, for Muhammad Ali's critics, fight provided more evidence of Muhammad Ali's arrogance.After Muhammad Ali's title defense against Zora Folley on March 22, Muhammad Ali was stripped of Muhammad Ali's due to Muhammad Ali's refusal to be drafted to army service. Muhammad Ali's boxing license was also suspended by the state of New York. Muhammad Ali was convicted of draft evasion on June 20 and sentenced to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine.

United States overturned Ali's conviction by a unanimous 8\u20130 decision (Justice Thurgood Marshall recused Justice Thurgood Marshall, as Justice Thurgood Marshall had been the U.S. Solicitor General at the time of Ali's conviction). a unanimous 8\u20130 decision was not based on, nor did a unanimous 8\u20130 decision address, the merits of [0]'s claims per se. Rather, the U.S. Supreme Court held that since the appeal board gave no reason for the denial of a conscientious objector exemption to [0], that it was therefore impossible to determine which of the three basic tests for conscientious objector status (offered in the Justice Department's brief) the appeal board relied on, and Ali's conviction must be reversed.In a 1974 interview, [0] said, \"If they say stand and salute the flag [0] do stand out of respect, because [0]'m in America\".

However, after [0] won the championship from Liston in 1964, the Nation of Islam was more receptive and agreed to publicize [0]'s membership. Shortly afterwards on March 6, Elijah Muhammad gave a radio address that [0] would be renamed Muhammad (one who is worthy of praise) Ali (most high). Around that time [0] moved to the south side of Chicago and lived in a series of houses, always near the Nation of Islam's Mosque Maryam or Elijah Muhammad's residence.
