Influenced by Impressionism and the Renaissance masters from a young age [0] became increasingly attracted to Cubism and avant-garde movements. [0] moved closer to Surrealism in the late 1920s and joined the Surrealist group in 1929, soon becoming one of the Surrealist group's leading exponents. [0]'s best-known work, The Persistence of Memory, was completed in August 1931, and is one of the most famous Surrealist paintings. [0] lived in France throughout the Spanish Civil War (1936 to 1939) before leaving for the United States in 1940 where [0] achieved commercial success. [0] returned to Spain in 1948 where [0] announced [0]'s return to the Catholic faith and developed [0]'s \"nuclear mysticism\" style, based on [0]'s interest in classicism, mysticism, and recent scientific developments.[0]'s artistic repertoire included painting, graphic arts, film, sculpture, design and photography, at times in collaboration with other artists. [0] also wrote fiction, poetry, autobiography, essays and criticism. Major themes in [0]'s work include dreams, the subconscious, sexuality, religion, science and [0]'s closest personal relationships. To the dismay of those who held [0]'s work in high regard, and to the irritation of [0]'s critics, [0]'s eccentric and ostentatious public behavior often drew more attention than [0]'s artwork. [0]'s public support for the Francoist regime, [0]'s commercial activities and the quality and authenticity of some of [0]'s late works have also been controversial. [0]'s life and work were an important influence on other Surrealists, pop art and contemporary artists such as Jeff Koons and Damien Hirst.There are two major museums devoted to [0]'s work: the Dal\u00ed Theatre-Museum in Figueres, Catalonia, Spain, and the Salvador Dal\u00ed Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida."}, "Biography": {"Early life": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was born on 11 May 1904, at 8:45\u00a0am, on the first floor of Carrer Monturiol, 20 in the town of Figueres, in the Empord\u00e0 region, close to the French border in Catalonia, Spain. Dal\u00ed's older brother, who had also been named Salvador (born 12 October 1901), had died of gastroenteritis nine months earlier, on 1 August 1903. His father, Salvador Luca Rafael Aniceto Dal\u00ed Cus\u00ed (1872\u20131950) was a middle-class lawyer and notary, an anti-clerical atheist and Catalan federalist, whose strict disciplinary approach was tempered by his wife, Felipa Dom\u00e8nech Ferr\u00e9s (1874\u20131921), who encouraged her son's artistic endeavorshis wife, Felipa Dom\u00e8nech Ferr\u00e9s (1874\u20131921), who encouraged her son's artistic endeavors's . In the summer of 1912, the family moved to the top floor of Carrer Monturiol 24 (presently 10). [0] later attributed [0]'s \"love of everything that is gilded and excessive, [0]'s passion for luxury and [0]'s love of oriental clothes\" to an \"Arab lineage\", claiming that [0]'s ancestors were descendants of the Moors.[0] was haunted by the idea of Dal\u00ed's older brother, who had also been named Salvador (born 12 October 1901), throughout his life, mythologizing Dal\u00ed's older brother, who had also been named Salvador (born 12 October 1901), in [0]'s writings and art. [0] said of Dal\u00ed's older brother, who had also been named Salvador (born 12 October 1901),, \"[we] resembled each other like two drops of water, but we had different reflections.\" Dal\u00ed's older brother, who had also been named Salvador (born 12 October 1901), \"was probably the first version of [0] but conceived too much in the absolute\". Images of Dal\u00ed's older brother, who had also been named Salvador (born 12 October 1901), would reappear in [0]'s later works, including Portrait of Dal\u00ed's older brother, who had also been named Salvador (born 12 October 1901), (1963).Dal\u00ed also had a sister, Ana Mar\u00eda, who was three years younger. and whom [0] painted 12 times between 1923 and 1926.His childhood friends included future FC Barcelona footballers Emili Sagi-Barba and Josep Samitier. During holidays at the Catalan resort town of Cadaqu\u00e9s, the trio played football together.[0] attended the Municipal Drawing School at the town of Figueres, in the Empord\u00e0 region, close to the French border in Catalonia, Spain in 1916 and also discovered modern painting on a summer vacation trip to the Catalan resort town of Cadaqu\u00e9s with the family of Ramon Pichot, a local artist who made regular trips to Paris. The next year, His father, Salvador Luca Rafael Aniceto Dal\u00ed Cus\u00ed (1872\u20131950) organized an exhibition of [0]'s charcoal drawings in the family's family home. [0] had [0]'s first public exhibition at the Municipal Theatre in the town of Figueres, in the Empord\u00e0 region, close to the French border in Catalonia, Spain in 1918, a site [0] would return to decades later. In early 1921 the family of Ramon Pichot, a local artist who made regular trips to Paris introduced [0] to Futurism. early 1921, [0]'s uncle Anselm Dom\u00e8nech, who owned a bookshop in Barcelona, supplied [0] with books and magazines on Cubism and contemporary art.On 6 February 1921, Dal\u00ed's mother died of uterine cancer. [0] was 16 years old and later said Dal\u00ed's mother's \"was the greatest blow [0] had experienced in his life. [0] worshipped Dal\u00ed's mother... [0] could not resign [0] to the loss of a being on whom [0] counted to make invisible the unavoidable blemishes of [0]'s soul.\" After diedDal\u00ed's mother, His father, Salvador Luca Rafael Aniceto Dal\u00ed Cus\u00ed (1872\u20131950) married Dal\u00ed's mother's . [0] did not resent married, because [0] had great love and respect for her sister.", "Madrid, Barcelona and Paris": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 1922, [0] moved into the Residencia de Estudiantes (Students' Residence) in Madrid and studied at the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando (San Fernando Royal Academy of Fine Arts). A lean 1.72 metres (5\u00a0ft 7+3\u20444\u00a0in) tall, [0] already drew attention as an eccentric and dandy. [0] had long hair and sideburns, coat, stockings, and knee-breeches in the style of English aesthetes of the late 19th century.At the Residencia de Estudiantes (Students' Residence) in Madrid, [0] became close friends with Pep\u00edn Bello, Luis Bu\u00f1uel, Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca, and others associated with the Madrid avant-garde group Ultra. The friendship with Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca had a strong element of mutual passion, but [0] said [0] rejected Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca's sexual advances. [0]'s friendship with Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca was to remain one of [0]'s most emotionally intense relationships until Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca's death at the hands of Nationalist forces in 1936 at the beginning of the Spanish Civil War.Also in 1922, [0] began what would become a lifelong relationship with the Prado Museum, which he felt was, 'incontestably the best museum of old paintings in the world.' Each Sunday morning, [0] went to the Prado Museum, which he felt was, 'incontestably the best museum of old paintings in the world to study the works of the great masters. 'went was the start of a monk-like period for [0], devoted entirely to solitary work: visits to the Prado, where, pencil in hand, [0] analyzed all of the great masterpieces, studio work, models, research.'Those paintings by [0] in which [0] experimented with Cubism earned [0] the most attention from [0]'s fellow students, since there were no Cubist artists in Madrid at the time. Cabaret Scene (1922) is a typical example of such work. Through [0]'s association with members of the Madrid avant-garde group Ultra, [0] became more acquainted with avant-garde movements, including Dada and Futurism.  One of [0]'s earliest works to show a strong Futurist and Cubist influence was the watercolor Night-Walking Dreams (1922). At this time, [0] also read Freud and Lautr\u00e9amont who were to have a profound influence on [0]'s work.In May 1925 [0] exhibited eleven works in a group exhibition held by the newly formed Sociedad Ib\u00e9rica de Artistas in Madrid. Seven of eleven works were in [0]'s Cubist mode and four in a more realist style. Several leading critics praised [0]'s work. [0] held his first solo exhibition at Galeries Dalmau in Barcelona, from 14 to 27 November 1925. his first solo exhibition, included twenty-two works and was a critical and commercial success.In April 1926 [0] made [0]'s first trip to Paris where [0] met Pablo Picasso, whom he revered. Pablo Picasso, whom he revered had already heard favorable reports about [0] from Joan Mir\u00f3, a fellow Catalan who later introduced him to many Surrealist friends. As [0] developed [0]'s own style over the next few years, [0] made some works strongly influenced by Pablo Picasso, whom he revered and Joan Mir\u00f3, a fellow Catalan who later introduced him to many Surrealist friends. [0] was also influenced by the work of Yves Tanguy, and [0] later allegedly told Tanguy's niece, \"[0] pinched everything from Tanguy's niece's .[0] left the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando (San Fernando Royal Academy of Fine Arts) in 1926, shortly before [0]'s final exams. [0]'s mastery of painting skills at that time was evidenced by [0]'s realistic The Basket of Bread, painted in 1926.Later that year [0] exhibited again at Galeries Dalmau in Barcelona, from 31 December 1926 to 14 January 1927, with the support of the art critic Sebasti\u00e0 Gasch\u00a0[es]. exhibited included twenty-three paintings and seven drawings, with the \"Cubist\" works displayed in a separate section from the \"objective\" works. The critical response was generally positive with Composition with Three Figures (Neo-Cubist Academy) singled out for particular attention.From 1927 [0]'s work became increasingly influenced by Surrealism. Two of these works, Honey is Sweeter than Blood (1927) and Gadget and Hand (1927), were shown at the annual Autumn Salon (Sal\u00f3 de tardor) in Barcelona in October 1927. [0] described the earlier of these works, Honey is Sweeter than Blood, as \"equidistant between Cubism and Surrealism\". these works featured many elements that were to become characteristic of [0]'s Surrealist period including dreamlike images, precise draftsmanship, idiosyncratic iconography (such as rotting donkeys and dismembered bodies), and lighting and landscapes strongly evocative of [0]'s native Catalonia. these works provoked bemusement among the public and debate among critics about whether [0] had become a Surrealist.Influenced by [0]'s reading of Freud, [0] increasingly introduced suggestive sexual imagery and symbolism into his work. [0] submitted Dialogue on the Beach (Unsatisfied Desires) (1928) to the Barcelona Autumn Salon for 1928 but Dialogue on the Beach (Unsatisfied Desires) (1928) was rejected because \"Dialogue on the Beach (Unsatisfied Desires) (1928) was not fit to be exhibited in any gallery habitually visited by the numerous public little prepared for certain surprises.\" The resulting scandal was widely covered in the Barcelona press and prompted a popular Madrid illustrated weekly to publish an interview with [0].Some trends in [0]'s work that would continue throughout [0]'s life were already evident in 1922. [0] was influenced by many styles of art, ranging from the most academically classic, to the most cutting-edge avant-garde. [0]'s classical influences included Raphael, Bronzino, Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n, Vermeer and Vel\u00e1zquez. Exhibitions of his work attracted much attention and a mixture of praise and puzzled debate from critics who noted an apparent inconsistency in [0]'s work by the use of both traditional and modern techniques and motifs between works and within individual works.In the mid-1920s [0] grew a neatly trimmed mustache. In later decades [0] cultivated a more flamboyant one in the manner of 17th-century Spanish master painter Diego Vel\u00e1zquez, and a more flamboyant one in the manner of 17th-century Spanish master painter Diego Vel\u00e1zquez became a well known [0] icon.", "1929 to World War II": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 1929, [0] collaborated with Surrealist film director Luis Bu\u00f1uel on the short film Un Chien Andalou (An Andalusian Dog). [0]'s main contribution was to help Surrealist film director Luis Bu\u00f1uel write the script for the short film Un Chien Andalou (An Andalusian Dog). [0] later claimed to have also played a significant role in the filming of the short film Un Chien Andalou (An Andalusian Dog), but played is not substantiated by contemporary accounts. In August 1929, [0] met his lifelong muse and future wife Gala, born Elena Ivanovna Diakonova. his lifelong muse and future wife Gala, born Elena Ivanovna Diakonova was a Russian immigrant ten years [0]'s senior, who at that time was married to Surrealist poet Paul \u00c9luard.In works such as The First Days of Spring, The Great Masturbator and The Lugubrious Game [0] continued [0]'s exploration of the themes of sexual anxiety and unconscious desires. Dal\u00ed's first Paris exhibition was at the recently opened Goemans Gallery in November 1929 and featured eleven works. In his's preface to the catalog, his described eleven works as \"the most hallucinatory that has been produced up to now\". Dal\u00ed's first Paris exhibition was a commercial success but the critical response was divided. In 1929, [0] officially joined the Surrealist group in the Montparnasse quarter of Paris. the Surrealist group hailed what [0] was later to call [0]'s paranoiac-critical method of accessing the subconscious for greater artistic creativity.Meanwhile, [0]'s relationship with his father was close to rupture. his father strongly disapproved of his father's romance with his lifelong muse and future wife Gala, born Elena Ivanovna Diakonova and saw [0]'s connection to the Surrealist group as a bad influence on [0]'s morals. The final straw was when his father read in a Barcelona newspaper that his father's had recently exhibited in Paris a drawing of the Sacred Heart of Jesus Christ, with a provocative inscription: \"Sometimes, I spit for fun on I's mother's portrait\". Outraged, his father demanded that his father's recant publicly. [0] refused, perhaps out of fear of expulsion from the Surrealist group, and was violently thrown out of [0]'s paternal home on 28 December 1929. his father told [0] that [0] would be disinherited and that [0] should never set foot in Cadaqu\u00e9s again. The following summer, Dal\u00ed and Gala his lifelong muse and future wife Gala, born Elena Ivanovna Diakonova rented a small fisherman's cabin in a nearby bay at Port Lligat. [0] soon bought a small fisherman's cabin in a nearby bay at Port Lligat, and over the years enlarged a small fisherman's cabin in a nearby bay at Port Lligat by buying neighboring ones, gradually building [0]'s beloved villa by the sea. his father would eventually relent and come to accept his lifelong muse and future wife Gala, born Elena Ivanovna Diakonova.In 1931, [0] painted one of his most famous works, The Persistence of Memory, which developed a surrealistic image of soft, melting pocket watches. The general interpretation of one of his most famous works, The Persistence of Memory, which developed a surrealistic image of soft, melting pocket watches is that soft, melting pocket watches are a rejection of the assumption that time is rigid or deterministic. a rejection of the assumption that time is rigid or deterministic is supported by other images in one of his most famous works, The Persistence of Memory, which developed a surrealistic image of soft, melting pocket watches, such as the wide expanding landscape, and other limp watches shown being devoured by ants.[0] had two important exhibitions at the Pierre Colle Gallery in Paris in June 1931 and May\u2013June 1932. The earlier exhibition included sixteen paintings of which The Persistence of Memory attracted the most attention. Some of the notable features of two important exhibitions were the proliferation of images and references to his lifelong muse and future wife Gala, born Elena Ivanovna Diakonova and the inclusion of Surrealist Objects such as Hypnagogic Clock and Clock Based on the Decomposition of Bodies. [0]'s last, and largest, the exhibition at the Pierre Colle Gallery in Paris was held in June 1933 and included twenty-two paintings, ten drawings, and two objects. One critic noted [0]'s precise draftsmanship and attention to detail, describing [0] as a \"paranoiac of geometrical temperament\". Dal\u00ed's first New York exhibition was held at Julien Levy's gallery in November\u2013December 1933. Dal\u00ed's first New York exhibition featured twenty-six works and was a commercial and critical success. The New York critic praised the precision and lack of sentimentality in twenty-six works, calling twenty-six works \"frozen nightmares\".Dal\u00ed and Galahis lifelong muse and future wife Gala, born Elena Ivanovna Diakonova, having lived together since 1929, were civilly married on 30 January 1934 in Paris. Dal\u00ed and Gala later remarried in a Church ceremony on 8 August 1958 at Sant Mart\u00ed Vell. In addition to inspiring many artworks throughout his lifelong muse and future wife Gala, born Elena Ivanovna Diakonova's , his lifelong muse and future wife Gala, born Elena Ivanovna Diakonova would act as [0]'s business manager, supporting Dal\u00ed and Gala's extravagant lifestyle while adeptly steering clear of insolvency. his lifelong muse and future wife Gala, born Elena Ivanovna Diakonovahis lifelong muse and future wife Gala, born Elena Ivanovna Diakonova , seemed to tolerate [0]'s dalliances with younger muses, secure in his lifelong muse and future wife Gala, born Elena Ivanovna Diakonova's own position as [0]'s primary relationship. [0] continued to paint his lifelong muse and future wife Gala, born Elena Ivanovna Diakonova as Dal\u00ed and Gala aged, producing sympathetic and adoring images of his lifelong muse and future wife Gala, born Elena Ivanovna Diakonova. The \"tense, complex and ambiguous relationship\" lasting over 50 years would later become the subject of an opera, Jo, Dal\u00ed (I, Dal\u00ed) by Catalan composer Xavier Benguerel.[0]'s first visit to the United States in November 1934 attracted widespread press coverage. [0]'s second New York exhibition was held at Julien Levy's gallery in November\u2013December 1934 and was again a commercial and critical success. [0] delivered three lectures on Surrealism at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) and other venues during which [0] told [0]'s audience for the first time that \"he only difference between [0] and a madman is that [0] am not mad.\" The heiress Caresse Crosby, the inventor of the brassiere, organized a farewell fancy dress ball for [0] on 18 January 1935. [0] wore a glass case on [0]'s chest containing a brassiere and his lifelong muse and future wife Gala, born Elena Ivanovna Diakonova dressed as a woman giving birth through her heada woman giving birth through her head's . A Paris newspaper later claimed that the Dal\u00eds had dressed as the Lindbergh baby and the Lindbergh baby's kidnapper, claimed[0] .While the majority of the Surrealist group had become increasingly associated with leftist politics, [0] maintained an ambiguous position on the subject of the proper relationship between politics and art. his accused [0] of defending the \"new\" and \"irrational\" in \"the Hitler phenomenon\", but [0] quickly rejected accused, saying, \"[0] am Hitlerian neither in fact nor intention\". [0] insisted that Surrealism could exist in an apolitical context and refused to explicitly denounce fascism. Later in 1934, [0] was subjected to a \"trial\", in which [0] narrowly avoided being expelled from the Surrealist group. To expelled, [0] retorted, \"The difference between the Surrealist group and [0] is that [0] am a Surrealist.\"In 1936, [0] took part in the London International Surrealist Exhibition. [0]'s lecture, titled Fant\u00f4mes paranoiacs authentiques, was delivered while wearing a deep-sea diving suit and helmet. [0] had arrived carrying a billiard cue and leading a pair of Russian wolfhounds and had to have helmet unscrewed as [0] gasped for breath. [0] commented that \"[0] just wanted to show that [0] was 'plunging deeply into the human mind.\"Dal\u00ed's first solo London exhibition was held at the Alex, Reid, and Lefevre Gallery 1929. \"Dal\u00ed's first solo London exhibition included twenty-nine paintings and eighteen drawings. The critical response was generally favorable, although the Daily Telegraph critic wrote: \"twenty-nine paintings and eighteen drawings reveal so skilled a craftsman that [0]'s return to full consciousness may be awaited with interest.\"In December 1936 [0] participated in the Fantastic Art, Dada, Surrealism exhibition at MoMA and a solo exhibition at the Julien Levy Gallery in New York. the Fantastic Art, Dada, Surrealism exhibition at MoMA and a solo exhibition at the Julien Levy Gallery in New York attracted large attendances and widespread press coverage. The painting Soft Construction with Boiled Beans (Premonition of Civil War) (1936) attracted particular attention. [0] later described The painting Soft Construction with Boiled Beans (Premonition of Civil War) (1936) as, \"a vast human body breaking out into monstrous excrescences of arms and legs tearing at one another in a delirium of auto-strangulation\". On 14 December, [0], was featured on the cover of Time magazine.From 1933 [0] was supported by Zodiac, a group of affluent admirers who each contributed to a monthly stipend for the painter in exchange for a painting of their choiceZodiac, a group of affluent admirers who each contributed to a monthly stipend for the painter in exchange for a painting of their choice's . From 1936 [0]'s main patron in London was the wealthy Edward James who would support him financially for two years. One of [0]'s most important paintings from the period of the wealthy Edward James who would support him financially for two years's patronage was The Metamorphosis of Narcissus (1937). They also collaborated on two of the most enduring icons of the Surrealist movement: the Lobster Telephone and the Mae West Lips Sofa.[0] was in London when the Spanish Civil War broke out in July 1936.  When [0] later learned that his friend Lorca had been executed by Nationalist forces, [0]'s claimed response was to shout: \"Ol\u00e9!\" [0] was to include frequent references to his friend Lorca in [0]'s art and writings for the remainder of her life. Nevertheless, [0] avoided taking a public stand for or against the Republic for the duration of the Spanish Civil War.In January 1938, [0] unveiled Rainy Taxi, a three-dimensional artwork consisting of an automobile and two mannequin occupants being soaked with rain from within the taxi. Rainy Taxi, a three-dimensional artwork consisting of an automobile and two mannequin occupants being soaked with rain from within the taxi was first displayed at the Galerie Beaux-Arts in Paris at the Exposition Internationale du Surr\u00e9alisme, organized by Andr\u00e9 Breton and Paul \u00c9luard. the Exposition Internationale du Surr\u00e9alisme, organized by Andr\u00e9 Breton and Paul \u00c9luard was designed by artist Marcel Duchamp, who also served as host.In March 1936, [0] met Sigmund Freud thanks to Stefan Zweig. As [0] sketched Sigmund Freud's portrait, Sigmund Freud whispered, \"[0] looks like a fanatic.\" [0] was delighted upon hearing later about this comment from Sigmund Freud. The following day Sigmund Freud wrote to Stefan Zweig \"...until now Sigmund Freud have been inclined to regard the Surrealists, who have apparently adopted me as their patron saint, the Surrealists, who have apparently adopted me as their patron saint,'s as complete fools.....That young Spaniard, with [0]'s candid fanatical eyes and [0]'s undeniable technical mastery, has changed Sigmund Freud's estimate. It would indeed be very interesting to investigate analytically how [0] came to create that picture [i.e. Metamorphosis of Narcissus].\"In September 1938, [0] was invited by Gabrielle Coco Chanel to Gabrielle Coco Chanel's house \"La Pausa\" in Roquebrune on the French Riviera. There [0] painted numerous paintings [0] later exhibited at Julien Levy Gallery in New York. This exhibition in March\u2013April 1939 included twenty-one paintings and eleven drawings. Life reported that no exhibition in New York had been so popular since Whistler's Mother was shown in 1934.At the 1939 New York World's Fair, [0] debuted his Dream of Venus Surrealist pavilion, located in the Amusements Area of the exposition. his Dream of Venus Surrealist pavilion, located in the Amusements Area of the exposition featured bizarre sculptures, statues, mermaids, and live nude models in \"costumes\" made of fresh seafood, an event photographed by Horst P. Horst, George Platt Lynes, and Murray Korman. [0] was angered by changes to [0]'s designs, railing against mediocrities who thought that \"a woman with the tail of a fish is possible; a woman with the head of a fish impossible.\"Soon after Franco's victory in the Spanish Civil War in April 1939, [0] wrote to Luis Bu\u00f1uel denouncing socialism and Marxism and praising Catholicism and the Falange. As a result, Bu\u00f1uel broke off relations with [0].In the May issue of the Surrealist magazine Minotaure, his announced [0]'s expulsion from the Surrealist group, claiming that [0] had espoused race war and that the over-refinement of [0]'s paranoiac-critical method was a repudiation of Surrealist automatism. announced led many Surrealists to break off relations with [0]. In 1949 his coined the derogatory nickname \"Avida Dollars\" (avid for dollars), an anagram for \"Salvador Dal\u00ed\". the derogatory nickname \"Avida Dollars\" (avid for dollars), an anagram for \"Salvador Dal\u00ed\" was a derisive reference to the increasing commercialization of [0]'s work, and the perception that [0] sought self-aggrandizement through fame and fortune.", "World War II": "Salvador Dali is our person to focus on. The outbreak of World War II in September 1939 saw [0] in France. Following the German invasion, [0] were able to escape because on 20 June 1940 [0] were issued visas by Aristides de Sousa Mendes, Portuguese consul in Bordeaux, France. [0] crossed into Portugal and subsequently sailed on the Excambion from Lisbon to New York in August 1940.  Salvador Dali were to live in the United States for eight years, splitting [0]'s time between New York and the Monterey Peninsula, California.Salvador Dali spent the winter of 1940\u201341 at Hampton Manor, the residence of Caresse Crosby, in Caroline County, Virginia, where Salvador Dali worked on various projects including his autobiography and paintings for his upcoming exhibition.Salvador Dali announced the death of the Surrealist movement and the return of classicism in his upcoming exhibition. his upcoming exhibition included nineteen paintings (among nineteen paintings Slave Market with the Disappearing Bust of Voltaire and The Face of War) and other works. In Salvador Dali's catalog essay and media comments, Salvador Dali proclaimed a return to form, control, structure and the Golden Section. Sales however were disappointing and the majority of critics did not believe there had been a major change in Dal\u00ed's work.On September 2, 1941, Salvador Dali hosted A Surrealistic Night in an Enchanted Forest in the Monterey Peninsula, California, a charity event which attracted national attention but raised little money for charity.The Museum of Modern Art held two major, simultaneous retrospectives of Salvador Dali and Joan Mir\u00f3 from November 1941 to February 1942, Salvador Dali being represented by forty-two paintings and sixteen drawings. Dal\u00ed's work attracted significant attention of critics and the exhibition later toured eight American cities, enhancing Salvador Dali's reputation in the United States.In October 1942, his autobiography was published simultaneously in New York and London and was reviewed widely by the press. Time magazine's reviewer called his autobiography \"one of the most irresistible books of the year\".  George Orwell later wrote a scathing review in the Saturday Book. A passage in his autobiography in which Salvador Dali claimed that Bu\u00f1uel was solely responsible for the anti-clericalism in the film L'Age d'Or may have indirectly led to Bu\u00f1uel resigning Bu\u00f1uel's position at MoMA in 1943 under pressure from the State Department. Salvador Dali also published a novel Hidden Faces in 1944 with less critical and commercial success.In the catalog essay for his upcoming exhibition Salvador Dali continued Salvador Dali's attack on the Surrealist movement, writing: \"Surrealism will at least have served to give experimental proof that total sterility and attempts at automatizations have gone too far and have led to a totalitarian system. ... Today's laziness and the total lack of technique have reached Today's laziness and the total lack of technique's paroxysm in the psychological signification of the current use of the college [collage]\". The critical response to the society portraits in his upcoming exhibition, however, was generally negative.In November\u2013December 1945 Salvador Dali exhibited new work at the Bignou Gallery in New York. exhibited included eleven oil paintings, watercolors, drawings, and illustrations. Works included Basket of Bread, Atomic and Uranian Melancholic Ideal, and My Wife Nude Contemplating her own Body Transformed into Steps, the Three Vertebrae of a Column, Sky and ArchitectureMy Wife Nude Contemplating her own Body Transformed into Steps, the Three Vertebrae of a Column, Sky and Architecture's . exhibited was notable for works in Salvador Dali's new classicism style and those heralding Salvador Dali's \"atomic period\".During the war years, Salvador Dali was also engaged in projects in various other fields. Salvador Dali executed designs for a number of ballets including Labyrinth (1942), Sentimental Colloquy, Mad Tristan, and The Cafe of Chinitas (all 1944). In 1945 Salvador Dali created the dream sequence for Alfred Hitchcock's film Spellbound.

In 1946, [0] worked with Walt Disney and animator John Hench on an unfinished animated film Destino.[0] exhibited new work at the Bignou Gallery from November 1947 to January 1948. The 14 oil paintings and other works in exhibited reflected [0]'s increasing interest in atomic physics. Notable works included Dematerialization Near the Nose of Nero (The Separation of the Atom), Intra-Atomic Equilibrium of a Swan's Feather, and a study for Leda Atomica. The proportions of a study for Leda Atomica were worked out in collaboration with a mathematician.In early 1948, Dal\u00ed's 50 Secrets of Magic Craftsmanship was published. Dal\u00ed's 50 Secrets of Magic Craftsmanship was a mixture of anecdotes, practical advice on painting, and Dal\u00ednian polemics.", "Later years in Spain": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 1948, Dal\u00ed and Gala moved back into Dal\u00ed and Gala's house in Port Lligat, on the coast near Cadaqu\u00e9s. For the next three decades, Dal\u00ed and Gala would spend most of Dal\u00ed and Gala's time there, spending winters in Paris and New York. [0]'s decision to live in Spain under Franco and [0]'s public support for Franco prompted outrage from many anti-Francoist artists and intellectuals. Pablo Picasso refused to mention [0]'s name or acknowledge [0]'s existence for the rest of Pablo Picasso's life. In 1960, Andr\u00e9 Breton unsuccessfully fought against the inclusion of Dal\u00ed's Sistine Madonna in the Surrealist Intrusion in the Enchanter's Domain exhibition organized by Marcel Duchamp in New York.  Andr\u00e9 Breton and other Surrealists issued a tract to coincide with the Enchanter's Domain exhibition organized by Marcel Duchamp in New York denouncing [0] as \"the ex-apologist of Hitler... and friend of Franco.In December 1949 Dal\u00ed's sister Anna Maria published Dal\u00ed's sister Anna Maria's book Salvador Dal\u00ed Seen by Dal\u00ed's sister Anna Maria. [0] was angered by passages that [0] considered derogatory towards [0]'s and broke off relations with [0]'s family. When Dal\u00ed's father died in September 1950 [0] learned that [0] had been virtually disinherited in Dal\u00ed's father's will. A two-year legal dispute followed over paintings and drawings [0] had left in [0]'s family home, during which [0] was accused of assaulting a public notary.As [0] moved further towards embracing Catholicism [0] introduced more religious iconography and themes in [0]'s painting. In 1948 [0] painted a study for The Madonna of Port Lligat (first version, 1949) and showed a study for The Madonna of Port Lligat (first version, 1949) to Pope Pius XII during an audience arranged to discuss [0]'s marriage to Gala. a study for The Madonna of Port Lligat (first version, 1949) was a precursor to the phase [0] dubbed \"Nuclear Mysticism,\" a fusion of Einsteinian physics, classicism, and Catholic mysticism.  In paintings such as Dal\u00ed's Sistine MadonnaPort Lligat, on the coast near Cadaqu\u00e9s, The Christ of Saint John on the Cross and The Disintegration of the Persistence of Memory, [0] sought to synthesize Christian iconography with images of material disintegration inspired by nuclear physics. [0]'s later Nuclear Mysticism works included La Gare de Perpignan (1965) and The Hallucinogenic Toreador (1968\u201370).Dal\u00ed's keen interest in natural science and mathematics was further manifested by the proliferation of images of DNA and rhinoceros horn shapes in works from the mid-1950s. According to [0], the rhinoceros horn signifies divine geometry because the rhinoceros horn grows in a logarithmic spiral. [0] was also fascinated by the Tesseract (a four-dimensional cube), using the Tesseract (a four-dimensional cube), for example, in Crucifixion (Corpus Hypercubus).Dal\u00ed had been extensively using optical illusions such as double images, anamorphosis, negative space, visual puns and trompe-l'\u0153il since [0]'s Surrealist period and using continued in [0]'s later work. At some point, [0] had a glass floor installed in a room near [0]'s studio in Port Lligat, on the coast near Cadaqu\u00e9s. [0] made extensive use of a glass floor to study foreshortening, both from above and from below, incorporating dramatic perspectives of figures and objects into [0]'s paintings.:\u200a17\u201318,\u200a172\u200a [0] also experimented with the bulletist technique pointillism, enlarged half-tone dot grids and stereoscopic images. [0] was among the first artists to employ holography in an artistic manner. In [0]'s later years, young artists such as Andy Warhol proclaimed [0] an important influence on pop art.In 1960, [0] began work on his Theatre-Museum in his home town of Figueres. his Theatre-Museum in his home town of Figueres was [0]'s largest single project and a main focus of [0]'s energy through to 1974, when his Theatre-Museum in his home town of Figueres opened. [0] continued to make additions through the mid-1980s.In 1955, [0] met Nanita Kalaschnikoff, who was to become a close friend, muse, and model. At a French nightclub in 1965 [0] met Amanda Lear, a fashion model then known as Peki Oslo. Amanda Lear, a fashion model then known as Peki Oslo became [0]'s prot\u00e9g\u00e9e and one of [0]'s muses.  According to Amanda Lear, a fashion model then known as Peki Oslo, Amanda Lear, a fashion model then known as Peki Oslo were united in a \"spiritual marriage\" on a deserted mountaintop.", "Final years and death": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 1968, [0] bought a castle in P\u00fabol for Gala, and from 1971 Gala would retreat there for weeks at a time, [0] having agreed not to visit without Gala's written permission. [0]'s fears of abandonment and estrangement from [0]'s contributed to depression and failing health.In 1980, at age 76, [0]'s health deteriorated sharply and [0] was treated for depression, drug addiction, and Parkinson-like symptoms, including a severe tremor in his right arm. There were also allegations that Gala had been supplying [0] with pharmaceuticals from Gala's own prescriptions.Gala died on 10 June 1982, at the age of 87. After died, [0] moved from Figueres to a castle in P\u00fabol.In 1982, King Juan Carlos bestowed on [0] the title of Marqu\u00e9s de Dal\u00ed de P\u00fabol (Marquess of Dal\u00ed of P\u00fabol) in the nobility of Spain, P\u00fabol being where Dal\u00ed then lived. the title of Marqu\u00e9s de Dal\u00ed de P\u00fabol (Marquess of Dal\u00ed of P\u00fabol) in the nobility of Spain, P\u00fabol being where Dal\u00ed then lived was initially hereditary, but at [0]'s request was changed to life-only in 1983.In May 1983, what was said to be Dal\u00ed's last painting, The Swallow's Tail, was revealed. Dal\u00ed's last painting, The Swallow's Tail was heavily influenced by the mathematical catastrophe theory of Ren\u00e9 Thom. However, some critics have questioned how [0] could have executed a painting with such precision given the severe tremor in his right arm.From early 1984 [0]'s worsened and [0] refused food, leading to severe undernourishment. [0] had previously stated [0]'s intention to put [0] into a state of suspended animation as [0] had read that some microorganisms could do. In August 1984 a fire broke out in [0]'s bedroom and [0] was hospitalized with severe burns. Two judicial inquiries found that a fire was caused by an electrical fault and no findings of negligence were made. After [0]'s release from hospital [0] moved to the Torre Galatea, an annex to the Dal\u00ed Theatre-Museum.There have been allegations that [0] was forced by [0]'s guardians to sign blank canvases that could later be used in forgeries. It is also alleged that [0] knowingly sold otherwise-blank lithograph paper which [0] had signed, possibly producing over 50,000 such sheets from 1965 until [0]'s . As a result, art dealers tend to be wary of late graphic works attributed to [0].In July 1986, [0] had a pacemaker implanted. On [0]'s return to the Dal\u00ed Theatre-Museum [0] made a brief public appearance, saying:When you are a genius, you do not have the right to die, because we are necessary for the progress of humanity. In November 1988, [0] entered hospital with heart failure. On 5 December 1988, [0] was visited by King Juan Carlos, who confessed that he had always been a serious devotee of Dal\u00edKing Juan Carlos, who confessed that he had always been a serious devotee of Dal\u00ed . [0] gave King Juan Carlos, who confessed that he had always been a serious devotee of Dal\u00ed a drawing, Head of Europa, which would turn out to be [0]'s final drawing.On the morning of 23 January 1989, [0] died of cardiac arrest at the age of 84. [0] is buried in the crypt below the stage of his Theatre-Museum in Figueres. the crypt below the stage of his Theatre-Museum in Figueres is across the street from the church of Sant Pere, where [0] had [0]'s baptism, first communion, and funeral, and is only 450 metres (1,480\u00a0ft) from the house where [0] was born.On 26 June 2017 it was announced that a judge in Madrid had ordered the exhumation of Dal\u00ed's body in order to obtain samples for a paternity suit. Joan Manuel Sevillano, manager of the Fundaci\u00f3n Gala Salvador Dal\u00ed  (The Gala-Salvador Dal\u00ed Foundation), denounced the exhumation of Dal\u00ed's body as inappropriate. the exhumation of Dal\u00ed's body took place on the evening of 20 July, and [0]'s DNA was extracted.  On 6 September 2017 the Fundaci\u00f3n Gala Salvador Dal\u00ed  (The Gala-Salvador Dal\u00ed Foundation) stated that the tests carried out proved conclusively that [0] and the claimant were not related. On 18 May 2020 a Spanish court dismissed an appeal from the claimant and ordered the claimant to pay the costs of the exhumation of Dal\u00ed's body.", "": ""}, "Symbolism": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. From the late 1920s, [0] progressively introduced many bizarre or incongruous images into [0]'s work which invite symbolic interpretation. While some of many bizarre or incongruous images suggest a straightforward sexual or Freudian interpretation ([0] read Freud in the late 1920s) others (such as locusts, rotting donkeys, and sea urchins) are idiosyncratic and have been variously interpreted. Some commentators have cautioned that [0]'s own comments on many bizarre or incongruous images are not always reliable.", "Food": "[0] is our person to focus on. Food and eating have a central place in [0]'s thoughts and work. [0] associated food with beauty and sex and was obsessed with the image of the female praying mantis eating the female praying mantis's mate after copulation. Bread was a recurring image in [0]'s art, from [0]'s early work The Basket of Bread to later public performances such as in 1958 when [0] gave a lecture in Paris using a 12-meter-long baguette an illustrative prop. [0] saw bread as \"the elementary basis of continuity\" and \"sacred subsistence\".The egg is another common Dal\u00ednian image. [0] connects the egg to the prenatal and intrauterine, thus using the egg to symbolize hope and love. the egg appears in The Great Masturbator, The Metamorphosis of Narcissus and many other works.  There are also giant sculptures of eggs in various locations at [0]'s house in Port Lligat as well as at the Dal\u00ed Theatre-Museum in Figueres.Both [0] and [0]'s father enjoyed eating sea urchins, freshly caught in the sea near Cadaqu\u00e9s. The radial symmetry of the sea urchin fascinated [0], and [0] adapted the sea urchin's form to many artworks. Other foods also appear throughout [0]'s work.The famous \"melting watches\" that appear in The Persistence of Memory suggest Einstein's theory that time is relative and not fixed. [0] later claimed that the idea for clocks functioning symbolically in this way came to [0] when [0] was contemplating Camembert cheese.", "Animals": "[0] is our person to focus on. The rhinoceros and rhinoceros horn shapes began to proliferate in Dal\u00ed's work from the mid-1950s. According to [0], the rhinoceros horn signifies divine geometry because the rhinoceros horn grows in a logarithmic spiral. [0] linked the rhinoceros to themes of chastity and to the Virgin Mary. However, [0] also used the rhinoceros as an obvious phallic symbol as in Young Virgin Auto-Sodomized by the Horns of Her Own ChastityYoung Virgin Auto-Sodomized by the Horns of Her Own Chastity's .Various other animals appear throughout Dal\u00ed's work: rotting donkeys and ants have been interpreted as pointing to death, decay, and sexual desire; the snail as connected to the human head ([0] saw a snail on a bicycle outside Freud's's house when [0] first met Freud's); and locusts as a symbol of waste and fear. The elephant is also a recurring image in [0]'s work; for example, Dream Caused by the Flight of a Bee Around a Pomegranate a Second Before Awakening. The elephants are inspired by Gian Lorenzo Bernini's sculpture base in Rome of an elephant carrying an ancient obelisk.", "Science": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0]'s life-long interest in science and mathematics was often reflected in his work. [0]'s soft watches have been interpreted as references to Einstein's theory of the relativity of time and space. Images of atomic particles appeared in his work soon after the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and strands of DNA appeared from the mid-1950s. In 1958 [0] wrote in [0]'s Anti-Matter Manifesto: \"In the Surrealist period, [0] wanted to create the iconography of the interior world and the world of the marvelous, of my father Freud. Today, the exterior world and that of physics have transcended the one of psychology. my father Freud today is Dr. Heisenberg.\"The Disintegration of the Persistence of Memory (1954) harks back to The Persistence of Memory (1931) and in portraying the Persistence of Memory (1954) in fragmentation and disintegration has been interpreted as a reference to Dr. Heisenberg's quantum mechanics."}, "Endeavors outside painting": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was a versatile artist. Some of [0]'s more popular works are sculptures and other objects, and [0] is also noted for [0]'s contributions to theater, fashion, and photography, among other areas.", "Sculptures and other objects": "[0] is our person to focus on. From the early 1930s, [0] was an enthusiastic proponent of the proliferation of three-dimensional Surrealist Objects to subvert perceptions of conventional reality, writing: \"museums will fast fill with objects whose uselessness, size and crowding will necessitate the construction, in deserts, of special towers to contain themobjects whose uselessness, size and crowding will necessitate the construction, in deserts, of special towers to contain them.\" [0]'s more notable early objects include Board of Demented Associations (1930\u201331), Retrospective Bust of a Woman (1933), Venus de Milo with Chest of Drawers (1936) and Aphrodisiac Dinner Jacket (1936). Two of the most popular objects of the Surrealist movement were Lobster Telephone (1936) and Mae West Lips Sofa (1937) which were commissioned by art patron Edward James. Lobsters and telephones had strong sexual connotations for [0]. Lobster Telephone (1936) was functional, and art patron Edward James purchased four of Lobster Telephone (1936) from [0] to replace the phones in art patron Edward James's home. Mae West Lips Sofa was shaped after the lips of actress Mae West, who was previously the subject of [0]'s watercolor, The Face of Mae West which may be used as a Surrealist Apartment (1934\u201335).  In December 1936 [0] sent Harpo Marx a Christmas present of a harp with barbed-wire strings.After World War II [0] authorized many sculptures derived from [0]'s most famous works and images. In [0]'s later years other sculptures also appeared, often in large editions, whose authenticity has sometimes been questioned.Between 1941 and 1970, [0] created an ensemble of 39 pieces of jewelry, many of which are intricate, some containing moving parts. The most famous assemblage, The Royal Heart, is made of gold and is encrusted with 46 rubies, 42 diamonds, and four emeralds, created in such a way that the center \"beats\" like a heart.[0] ventured into industrial design in the 1970s with a 500-piece run of Suomi tableware by Timo Sarpaneva that [0] decorated for the German Rosenthal porcelain maker's \"Studio Linie\".  In 1969 [0] designed the Chupa Chups logo. [0] facilitated the design of the advertising campaign for the 1969 Eurovision Song Contest and created a large on-stage metal sculpture that stood at the Teatro Real in Madrid.", "Theater and film": "[0] is our person to focus on. In theater, [0] designed the scenery for Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca's 1927 romantic play Mariana Pineda. For Bacchanale (1939), a ballet based on and set to the music of Richard Wagner's 1845 opera Tannh\u00e4user, [0] provided both the set design and the libretto. [0] executed designs for a number of other ballets including Labyrinth (1942), Sentimental Colloquy, Mad Tristan, The Cafe of Chinitas (all 1944) and The Three-Cornered Hat  (1949).Dal\u00ed became interested in film when [0] was young, going to the theater most Sundays. By the late 1920s [0] was fascinated by the potential of film to reveal \"the unlimited fantasy born of things themselvesthings themselves\" and went on to collaborate with the director Luis Bu\u00f1uel on two Surrealist films: the 17-minute short Un Chien Andalou (1929) and the feature film L'Age d'Or (1930). Dal\u00ed and Bu\u00f1uel the director Luis Bu\u00f1uel agree that Dal\u00ed and Bu\u00f1uel jointly developed the script and imagery of the 17-minute short Un Chien Andalou (1929), but there is controversy over the extent of [0]'s contribution to the feature film L'Age d'Or (1930). the 17-minute short Un Chien Andalou (1929) features a graphic opening scene of a human eyeball being slashed with a razor and develops surreal imagery and irrational discontinuities in time and space to produce a dreamlike quality. the feature film L'Age d'Or (1930) is more overtly anti-clerical and anti-establishment, and was banned after right-wing groups staged a riot in the Parisian theater where the feature film L'Age d'Or (1930) was being shown. Summarizing the impact of two Surrealist films: the 17-minute short Un Chien Andalou (1929) and the feature film L'Age d'Or (1930) on the Surrealist film movement, one commentator has stated: \"If the 17-minute short Un Chien Andalou (1929) stands as the supreme record of Surrealism's's adventures into the realm of the unconscious, then the feature film L'Age d'Or (1930) is perhaps the most trenchant and implacable expression of Surrealism's's revolutionary intent.\"After [0] collaborated with the director Luis Bu\u00f1uel, [0] worked on several unrealized film projects including a published script for a film, Babaouo (1932); a scenario for Harpo Marx called Giraffes on Horseback Salad (1937); and an abandoned dream sequence for the film Moontide (1942). In 1945 [0] created the dream sequence in Hitchcock's Spellbound, but neither [0] nor the director Luis Bu\u00f1uel was satisfied with the result. [0] also worked with Walt Disney and animator John Hench on the short film Destino in 1946. After initially being abandoned, the short film Destino was completed in 2003 by Baker Bloodworth and Walt Disney's nephew Roy E. Disney. Between 1954 and 1961 [0] worked with photographer Robert Descharnes on The Prodigious History of the Lacemaker and the Rhinoceros, but The Prodigious History of the Lacemaker and the Rhinoceros was never completed.In the 1960s [0] worked with some directors on documentary and performance films including with Philippe Halsman on Chaos and Creation (1960), Jack Bond on Dal\u00ed in New York (1966) and Jean-Christophe Averty on Soft Self-Portrait of [0] (1966).Dal\u00ed collaborated with director Jos\u00e9-Montes Baquer on the pseudo-documentary film Impressions of Upper Mongolia (1975), in which [0] narrates a story about an expedition in search of giant hallucinogenic mushrooms. In the mid-1970s film director Alejandro Jodorowsky initially cast [0] in the role of the Padishah Emperor in a production of Dune, based on the novel by Frank Herbert. However, film director Alejandro Jodorowsky changed film director Alejandro Jodorowsky's mind after [0] publicly supported the execution of alleged ETA terrorists in December 1975. The film was ultimately never made.In 1972 [0] began to write the scenario for an opera-poem called \u00catre Dieu (To Be God). The Spanish writer Manuel V\u00e1zquez Montalb\u00e1n wrote the libretto and Igor Wakh\u00e9vitch the music. an opera-poem called \u00catre Dieu (To Be God) was recorded in Paris in 1974 with [0] in the role of the protagonist.", "Fashion and photography": "[0] is our person to focus on. Fashion designer Elsa Schiaparelli worked with [0] from the 1930s and commissioned [0] to produce a white dress with a lobster print. Other designs [0] made for Fashion designer Elsa Schiaparelli include a shoe-shaped hat and a pink belt with lips for a buckle. [0] was also involved in creating textile designs and perfume bottles. In 1950, [0] created a special \"costume for the year 2045\" with Christian Dior.Photographers with whom [0] collaborated include Man Ray, Brassa\u00ef, Cecil Beaton, and Philippe Halsman. Philippe Halsman produced the Dal\u00ed Atomica series (1948)\u00a0\u2013  inspired by [0]'s painting Leda Atomica\u00a0\u00a0\u2013  which in one photograph depicts \"a painter's easel, three cats, a bucket of water, and [0] floating in the air\".", "Architecture": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0]'s architectural achievements include [0]'s Port Lligat house near Cadaqu\u00e9s, as well as [0]'s Theatre Museum in Figueres. A major work outside of Spain was the temporary Dream of Venus Surrealist pavilion at the 1939 New York World's Fair, which contained several unusual sculptures and statues, including live performers posing as statues. In 1958, [0] completed Crisalida, a temporary installation promoting a drug, which was exhibited at a medical convention in San Francisco.", "Literary works": "[0] is our person to focus on. In his only novel, Hidden Faces (1944), [0] describes the intrigues of a group of eccentric aristocrats whose extravagant lifestyle symbolizes the decadence of the 1930s. The Comte de Grandsailles and Solange de Cl\u00e9da pursue a love affair, but interwar political turmoil and other vicissitudes drive The Comte de Grandsailles and Solange de Cl\u00e9da apart. his only novel, Hidden Faces (1944) is variously set in Paris, rural France, Casablanca in North Africa, and Palm Springs in the United States. Secondary characters include aging widow Barbara Rogers, her bisexual daughter Veronica, her bisexual daughter Veronica's sometime female lover Betka, and Baba, a disfigured U.S. fighter pilot. his only novel, Hidden Faces (1944) was written in New York, and translated by Haakon Chevalier.[0]'s other literary works include The Secret Life of [0] (1942), Diary of a Genius (1966), and Oui: The Paranoid-Critical Revolution (1971). [0] also published poetry, essays, art criticism, and a technical manual on art.", "Graphic arts": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] worked extensively in the graphic arts, producing many drawings, etchings, and lithographs. Among the most notable of many drawings, etchings, and lithographs are forty etchings for an edition of Lautr\u00e9amont's The Songs of Maldoror (1933) and eighty drypoint reworkings of Goya's Caprichos (1973\u201377). From the 1960s, however, [0] would often sell the rights to images but not be involved in the print production itselfthe print production itself. In addition, a large number of fakes were produced in the 1980s and 1990s, thus further confusing the [0] print market.Book illustrations were an important part of [0]'s work throughout [0]'s career. [0]'s first book illustration was for the 1924 publication of the Catalan poem Les bruixes de Llers\u00a0[ca] (\"The Witches of Liers\") by [0]'s friend and schoolmate, poet Carles Fages de Climent. [0]'s other notable book illustrations, apart from Lautr\u00e9amont's The Songs of Maldoror, include 101 watercolors and engravings for The Divine Comedy (1960) and 100 drawings and watercolors for The Arabian Nights (1964)."}, "Politics and personality": {"Politics and religion": "[0] is our person to focus on. As a youth, [0] identified as communist, anti-monarchist and anti-clerical, and in 1924 [0] was briefly imprisoned by the Primo de Rivera dictatorship as a person \"intensely liable to cause public disorder\". When [0] officially joined the Surrealist group in 1929 [0]'s political activism initially intensified. In 1931, [0] became involved in the Workers' and Peasants' Front, delivering lectures at meetings and contributing to the Workers' and Peasants' Front's party journal. However, as political divisions within the Surrealist group grew, [0] soon developed a more apolitical stance, refusing to publicly denounce fascism. In 1934, Andr\u00e9 Breton accused [0] of being sympathetic to Hitler and [0] narrowly avoided being expelled from the Surrealist group. In 1935 [0] wrote a letter to Andr\u00e9 Breton suggesting that non-white races should be enslaved.  After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, [0] avoided taking a public stand for or against the Republic. However, immediately after Franco's's victory in 1939, [0] praised Catholicism and the Falange and was expelled from the Surrealist group.After [0]'s return to [0]'s native Catalonia in 1948, [0] publicly supported Franco's's regime and announced [0]'s return to the Catholic faith. [0] was granted an audience with Pope Pius XII in 1949 and with Pope John XXIII in 1959. [0] had official meetings with Franco's in June 1956, October 1968, and May 1974. In October 1968, [0] stated that on Franco's's death there should be no return to democracy and Spain should become an absolute monarchy. In September 1975, [0] publicly supported Franco's's decision to execute three alleged Basque terrorists and repeated [0]'s support for an absolute monarchy, adding: \"Personally, [0]'m against freedom; [0]'m for the Holy Inquisition.\"  In the following days, [0] fled to New York after [0]'s home in Port Lligat was stoned and [0] had received numerous death threats.

[0] was interested in the writings of the Jesuit priest and philosopher Teilhard de Chardin and the Jesuit priest and philosopher Teilhard de Chardin's Omega Point theory. [0]'s painting Tuna Fishing (Homage to Meissonier) (1967) was inspired by [0]'s reading of the Jesuit priest and philosopher Teilhard de Chardin.", "Sexuality": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0]'s sexuality had a profound influence on [0]'s work. [0] stated that as a child [0] saw a book with graphic illustrations of venereal diseases and a book with graphic illustrations of venereal diseases provoked a life-long disgust of female genitalia and a fear of impotence and sexual intimacy. [0] frequently stated that [0]'s main sexual activity involved voyeurism and masturbation and [0]'s preferred sexual orifice was the anus. [0] said that [0]'s wife Gala was the only person with whom [0] had achieved complete coitus. From 1927 [0]'s work featured graphic and symbolic sexual images usually associated with other images evoking shame and disgust. Images of anality and excrement also abound in [0]'s work from this time. Some of the most notable works reflecting these themes include The First Days of Spring (1929), The Great Masturbator (1929), and The Lugubrious Game (1929). Several of [0]'s intimates in the 1960s and 1970s have stated that [0] would arrange for selected guests to perform choreographed sexual activities to aid [0]'s voyeurism and masturbation.", "Personality": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was renowned for [0]'s eccentric and ostentatious behavior throughout [0]'s career.
