Until 1997, [0] rarely stayed for more than two weeks, when [0]'s friend Jonathan Silver, who was terminally ill, encouraged [0] to capture the local surroundings. [0] did capture at first with paintings based on memory, some from [0]'s boyhood. In 1998, [0] completed the painting of the Yorkshire landmark, Garrowby Hill. [0] returned to Yorkshire for increasingly longer stays, and by 2003 was painting the countryside en plein air in both oils and watercolour. [0] set up residence and studio in a converted bed and breakfast, in the seaside town of Bridlington, about 75\u00a0mi (121\u00a0km) from where [0] was born. The oil paintings [0] produced after 2005 were influenced by [0]'s intensive studies in watercolour, a series titled Midsummer: East Yorkshire (2003\u20132004). [0] created paintings made of multiple smaller canvases\u2014two to fifty\u2014placed together. To help [0] visualise work at that scale, [0] used digital photographic reproductions to study the day's work.In spring 2020 [0] stayed at La Grande Cour, a farmhouse and studio in Normandy, during the global COVID-19 pandemic."}, "Work": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on.

[0] has returned to painting portraits throughout [0]'s career. From 1968, and for the next few years, [0] painted portraits and double portraits of friends, lovers, and relatives just under life-size in a realistic style that adroitly captured the likenesses of [0]'s subjects.

Perhaps more than all of these, [0] has turned to [0]'s own figure year after year, creating over 300 self-portraits.From 1999 to 2001 [0] used a camera lucida for [0]'s research into art history as well as [0]'s own work in the studio.

[0] calls the paintings started in 2013 \"twenty-hour exposures\" because each sitting took six to seven hours on three consecutive days.", "Printmaking": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] experimented with printmaking as early as a lithograph Self-Portrait in 1954 and worked in etchings during [0]'s time at RCA. In 1965, the print workshop Gemini G.E.L. approached [0] to create a series of lithographs with a Los Angeles theme. [0] responded by creating The Hollywood Collection, a series of lithographs recreating the art collection of a Hollywood star, each piece depicting an imagined work of art within a frame. [0] went on to produce many other portfolios with the print workshop Gemini G.E.L. including Friends, The Weather Series, and Some New Prints. During the 1960s [0] produced several series of prints [0] thought of as 'graphic tales', including A Rake's Progress (1961\u201363) after Hogarth, Illustrations for Fourteen Poems from C.P. Cavafy (1966) and Illustrations for Six Fairy Tales from the Brothers Grimm (1969).In 1973 [0] began a fruitful collaboration with Aldo Crommelynck, Picasso's preferred printer. In [0]'s atelier, [0] adopted Aldo Crommelynck, Picasso's preferred printer's trademark sugar lift, as well as a system of Aldo Crommelynck, Picasso's preferred printer's own devising of imposing a wooden frame onto the plate to ensure colour separation. Their early work together included Artist and Model (1973\u201374) and Contrejour in the French Style (1974). In 1976\u201377 [0] created The Blue Guitar, a suite of 20 etchings, each utilising Crommelynck's techniques and filled with references to Picasso. The frontispiece to The Blue Guitar, a suite of 20 etchings, each utilising Crommelynck's techniques and filled with references to Picasso mentions [0]'s dual inspiration; \"The Blue Guitar: Etchings By David Hockney Who Was Inspired By Wallace Stevens Who Was Inspired By Picasso's\". 20 etchings refer to themes in a poem by Wallace Stevens, The Man with the Blue Guitar. The Blue Guitar, a suite of 20 etchings, each utilising Crommelynck's techniques and filled with references to Picasso was published by Petersburg Press in October 1977. 1977, Petersburg Press also published a book in which the images were accompanied by a poem by Wallace Stevens, The Man with the Blue Guitar's text.In the summer of 1978, [0] stayed for six weeks with his friend the printer Ken Tyler at his friend the printer Ken Tyler's studio in New York, Tyler Graphics Ltd. Tyler invited [0] to try a new technique with liquid paper. The process is painting with liquid paper, so [0] had to do The process [0] by hand. Each image becomes a unique work between printmaking and painting. In six weeks, [0] created a total of 29 artworks with a series of 17 sunflowers and swimming pools. Many of a total of 29 artworks are very similar, differentiated by changes in colour choice and application of the colour. Some are solely coloured using paper pulp, while some use spray paint to achieve certain details.Some of [0]'s other print portfolios include Home Made Prints (1986), Recent Etchings (1998) and Moving Focus (1984\u20131986), which contains lithographs related to A Walk Around the Hotel Courtyard, Acatlan. A retrospective of [0]'s prints, including 'computer drawings' printed on fax machines and inkjet printers, was exhibited at Dulwich Picture Gallery in London 5 February \u2013 11 May 2014 and Bowes Museum, County Durham 7 June \u2013 28 September 2014, with an accompanying publication, [0], by Richard Lloyd.", "Photocollages": "[0] is our person to focus on. In the early 1980s, [0] began to produce photo collages\u2014which, in [0]'s early explorations within [0]'s personal photo albums, [0] referred to as \"joiners\"\u2014first using Polaroid prints and subsequently 35mm, commercially processed colour prints. Using Polaroid snaps or photolab-prints of a single subject, [0] arranged a patchwork to make a composite image.[permanent dead link] Because the photographs are taken from different perspectives and at slightly different times, the result is work that has an affinity with Cubism, one of [0]'s major aims\u2014discussing the way human vision works. Some pieces are landscapes, such as Pearblossom Highway #2, others portraits, such as Kasmin 1982, and My Mother, Bolton Abbey, 1982.Creation of the \"joiners\" occurred accidentally. [0] noticed in the late 1960s that photographers were using cameras with wide-angle lenses. [0] did not like cameras with wide-angle lenses because cameras with wide-angle lenses looked somewhat distorted. While working on a painting of a living room and terrace in Los Angeles, [0] took Polaroid shots of the living room and glued Polaroid shots of the living room together, not intending for Polaroid shots of the living room to be a composition on Polaroid shots of the living room's own. On looking at the final composition, [0] realised the final composition created a narrative, as if the viewer moved through a living room. [0] began to work more with photography after this discovery, stopping painting for a while to pursue this new technique exclusively.Over time, however, [0] discovered what [0] could not capture with a lens, saying: \"Photography seems to be rather good at portraiture, or can be. But, Photography can't tell you about space, which is the essence of landscape. For [0] anyway. Even Ansel Adams can't quite prepare you for what Yosemite looks like when you go through that tunnel and you come out the other side.\" Frustrated with the limitations of photography and photography's 'one-eyed' approach, [0] returned to painting.", "Other technology": "[0] is our person to focus on. In December 1985 [0] used the Quantel Paintbox, a computer program that allowed [0] to sketch directly onto the screen. The resulting work was featured in a BBC series that profiled several artists. In 1999\u20132001, David's sister, Margaret, began experimenting with digital photography, scanning and computer printing, particularly making images of flowers scanning a small Japanese vase and fresh flowers. In 2003, David's sister, Margaret, was experimenting with Photoshop, scanning summer flowers and building up images in layers which David's sister, Margaret, printed out on an A3 printer. In 2004, [0] went to stay with David's sister, Margaret, and David's sister, Margaret, helped [0] scan [0]'s sketchbook of Yorkshire landscape and [0] soon began using a Wacom pad and pen directly into Photoshop.Since 2009, [0] has painted hundreds of portraits, still lifes and landscapes using the Brushes iPhone and iPad application, often sending hundreds of portraits, still lifes and landscapes to [0]'s friends. In 2010 and 2011, [0] visited Yosemite National Park to draw Yosemite National Park's landscape on [0]'s iPad. [0] used an iPad in designing a stained glass window at Westminster Abbey which celebrated the reign of Queen Elizabeth II. Unveiled in September 2018, a stained glass window at Westminster Abbey which celebrated the reign of Queen Elizabeth II is located in the north transept of Westminster Abbey and features a hawthorn blossom scene which is set in Yorkshire.From 2010 to 2014, [0] created multi-camera movies using three to eighteen cameras to record a single scene. [0] filmed the landscape of Yorkshire in various seasons, jugglers and dancers, and [0]'s own exhibitions within the de Young Museum and the Royal Academy of Arts.[0]'s earlier photocollages influenced [0]'s shift to another medium, digital photography. [0] combined hundreds of photographs to create multi-viewpoint \"photographic drawings\" of groups of [0]'s friends in 2014. [0] picked the process back up in 2017, this time using the more advanced Agisoft PhotoScan photogrammetric software which allowed [0] to stitch together and rearrange thousands of photos. The resulting images were printed out as massive photomurals and were exhibited at Pace Gallery and LACMA in 2018.", "Plein air landscapes": "[0] is our person to focus on.

This work \"is a monumental-scale view of a coppice in [0]'s native Yorkshire, between Bridlington and York. This work was painted on 50 individual canvases, mostly working in situ, over five weeks last winter.\" In 2008, [0] donated This work to Tate in London, saying: \"[0] thought if [0]'m going to give something to Tate in London [0] want to give Tate in London something really good.

In 1994, [0] designed costumes and scenery for twelve opera arias for the TV broadcast of Pl\u00e1cido Domingo's Operalia in Mexico City. Technical advances allowed [0] to become increasingly complex in model-making. At [0]'s studio [0] had a proscenium opening 6 feet (1.8\u00a0m) by 4 feet (1.2\u00a0m) in which [0] built sets in 1:8 scale. [0] also used a computerised setup that let [0] punch in and program lighting cues at will and synchronise lighting cues to a soundtrack of the music.In 2017, [0] was awarded the San Francisco Opera Medal on the occasion of the revival and restoration of [0]'s production for Puccini's Turandot.The majority of [0]'s theatre works and stage design studies are found in the collection of The David Hockney Foundation."}, "Exhibitions": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on.
