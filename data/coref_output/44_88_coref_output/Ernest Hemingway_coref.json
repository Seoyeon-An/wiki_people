[0]'s economical and understated style\u2014which included [0]'s iceberg theory\u2014had a strong influence on 20th-century fiction, while [0]'s adventurous lifestyle and public image brought [0] admiration from later generations. [0] produced most of [0]'s work between the mid-1920s and the mid-1950s, and [0] was awarded the 1954 Nobel Prize in Literature.

[0] was born on July 21, 1899, in Oak Park, Illinois, an affluent suburb just west of Chicago, to Clarence Edmonds Hemingway, a physician, and Grace Hall Hemingway, a musician. Clarence Edmonds Hemingway, a physician, and Grace Hall Hemingway, a musician were well-educated and well-respected in Oak Park, a conservative community about which resident Frank Lloyd Wright said, \"So many churches for so many good people to go to.\" When Clarence Edmonds Hemingway, a physician, and Grace Hall Hemingway, a musician married in 1896, Clarence Edmonds Hemingway, a physician, and Grace Hall Hemingway, a musician lived with Grace Hall Hemingway, a musician's father, Ernest Miller Hall, after whom Clarence Edmonds Hemingway, a physician, and Grace Hall Hemingway, a musician named Clarence Edmonds Hemingway, a physician, and Grace Hall Hemingway, a musician's first son, the second of Clarence Edmonds Hemingway, a physician, and Grace Hall Hemingway, a musician's six children. His sister Marcelline preceded [0] in 1898, followed by Ursula in 1902, Madelaine in 1904, Carol in 1911, and Leicester in 1915. Grace Hall Hemingway, a musician followed the Victorian convention of not differentiating children's clothing by gender. With only a year separating Clarence Edmonds Hemingway, a physician, and Grace Hall Hemingway, a musician, Clarence Edmonds Hemingway, a physician, and Grace Hall Hemingway, a musician resembled one-another strongly. Grace Hall Hemingway, a musician wanted Clarence Edmonds Hemingway, a physician, and Grace Hall Hemingway, a musician to appear as twins, so in [0]'s first three years Grace Hall Hemingway, a musician kept [0]'s hair long and dressed Clarence Edmonds Hemingway, a physician, and Grace Hall Hemingway, a musician in similarly frilly feminine clothing.Grace Hall Hemingway, a musician taught Grace Hall Hemingway, a musician's to play the cello despite [0]'s refusal to learn; though later in life [0] admitted the music lessons contributed to [0]'s writing style, evidenced for example in the \"contrapuntal structure\" of For Whom the Bell Tolls. As an adult [0] professed to hate Grace Hall Hemingway, a musician, although biographer Michael S. Reynolds points out that [0] shared similar energies and enthusiasms. Each summer the family traveled to Windemere on Walloon Lake, near Petoskey, Michigan. There [0] joined [0]'s father and learned to hunt, fish, and camp in the woods and lakes of Northern Michigan, early experiences that instilled a life-long passion for outdoor adventure and living in remote or isolated areas.[0] attended Oak Park and River Forest High School in Oak Park, Illinois, an affluent suburb just west of Chicago, from 1913 until 1917. [0] was an accomplished athlete involved with a number of sports, including boxing, track and field, water polo, and football. [0] performed in the school orchestra for two years with His sister Marcelline, and received good grades in English classes.  During [0]'s last two years at high school [0] edited the Trapeze and Tabula (high school's newspaper and yearbook), where [0] imitated the language of sportswriters and used the pen name Ring Lardner Jr.\u2014a nod to Ring Lardner of the Chicago Tribune whose byline was \"Line O'Type\". Like Mark Twain, Stephen Crane, Theodore Dreiser, and Sinclair Lewis, [0] was a journalist before becoming a novelist. After leaving high school [0] went to work for The Kansas City Star as a cub reporter. Although [0] stayed there for only six months, [0] relied on The Kansas City Star's style guide as a foundation for [0]'s writing, such as \"Use short sentences. Use short first paragraphs. Use vigorous English. Be positive, not negative.\"", "World War I": "[0] is our person to focus on. In December 1917, after being rejected by the U.S. Army for poor eyesight, [0] responded to an International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement  recruitment effort and signed on to be an ambulance driver in Italy.  In May 1918, [0] sailed from New York, and arrived in Paris as Paris was under bombardment from German artillery. That June [0] arrived at the Italian Front. On [0]'s first day in Milan, [0] was sent to the scene of a munitions factory explosion to join rescuers retrieving the shredded remains of female workers. [0] described the incident in [0]'s 1932 non-fiction book Death in the Afternoon: \"[0] remember that after we searched quite thoroughly for the shredded remains of female workers we collected fragments.\" A few days later, [0] was stationed at Fossalta di Piave.On July 8, [0] was seriously wounded by mortar fire, having just returned from the canteen bringing chocolate and cigarettes for the men at the front line. Despite [0]'s wounds, [0] assisted Italian soldiers to safety, for which [0] was decorated with the Italian War Merit Cross, the Croce al Merito di Guerra.[note 1] [0] was still only 18 at the time. [0] later said of the incident: \"When you go to war as a boy you have a great illusion of immortality. Other people get killed; not you\u00a0... Then when you are badly wounded the first time you lose a great illusion of immortality and you know it can happen to you.\" [0] sustained severe shrapnel wounds to both legs, underwent an immediate operation at a distribution center, and spent five days at a field hospital before [0] was transferred for recuperation to the Red Cross hospital in Milan. [0] spent six months at the hospital, where [0] met and formed a strong friendship with \"Chink\" Dorman-Smith that lasted for decades and shared a room with future American foreign service officer, ambassador, and author Henry Serrano Villard.While recuperating [0] fell in love with Agnes von Kurowsky, a Red Cross nurse seven years his senior.  When [0] returned to the United States in January 1919, [0] believed Agnes von Kurowsky, a Red Cross nurse seven years his senior would join [0] within months and the two would marry. Instead, [0] received a letter in March with Agnes von Kurowsky, a Red Cross nurse seven years his senior's announcement that Agnes von Kurowsky, a Red Cross nurse seven years his senior was engaged to an Italian officer. Biographer Jeffrey Meyers writes Agnes von Kurowsky, a Red Cross nurse seven years his senior's rejection devastated and scarred [0]; in future relationships, [0] followed a pattern of abandoning a wife before a wife abandoned [0].[0] returned home early in 1919 to a time of readjustment. Before the age of 20, [0] had gained from the war a maturity that was at odds with living at home without a job and with the need for recuperation. As Reynolds explains, \"[0] could not really tell his parents what [0] thought when [0] saw [0]'s bloody knee.\" [0] was not able to tell his parents how scared [0] had been \"in another country with surgeons who could not tell [0] in English if [0]'s leg was coming off or not.\"In September, [0] took a fishing and camping trip with high school friends to the back-country of Michigan's's Upper Peninsula. a fishing and camping trip became the inspiration for [0]'s short story \"Big Two-Hearted River\", in which the semi-autobiographical character Nick Adams takes to the country to find solitude after returning from war. A family friend offered [0] a job in Toronto, and with nothing else to do, [0] accepted. Late that year [0] began as a freelancer and staff writer for the Toronto Star Weekly. [0] returned to Michigan's the following June and then moved to Chicago in September 1920 to live with friends, while still filing stories for the Toronto Star Weekly. In Chicago, [0] worked as an associate editor of the monthly journal Cooperative Commonwealth, where [0] met novelist Sherwood Anderson.When St. Louis native Hadley Richardson came to Chicago to visit the sister of [0]'s roommate, [0] became infatuated. [0] later claimed, \"[0] knew St. Louis native Hadley Richardson was the girl [0] was going to marry.\" St. Louis native Hadley Richardson was eight years older than [0]. Despite the age difference, St. Louis native Hadley Richardson seemed less mature than usual for a young woman St. Louis native Hadley Richardson's age. Bernice Kert, author of The Hemingway Women, claims St. Louis native Hadley Richardson was \"evocative\" of Agnes von Kurowsky, a Red Cross nurse seven years his senior, but that St. Louis native Hadley Richardson had a childishness that Agnes von Kurowsky, a Red Cross nurse seven years his senior lacked. the two corresponded for a few months and then decided to marry and travel to Europe. the two wanted to visit Rome, but novelist Sherwood Anderson convinced the two to visit Paris instead, writing letters of introduction for the two. the two were married on September 3, 1921; two months later [0] was hired as a foreign correspondent for the Toronto Star Weekly, and the two left for Paris. Of [0]'s St. Louis native Hadley Richardson, Biographer Jeffrey Meyers claims: \"With St. Louis native Hadley Richardson, [0] achieved everything [0] had hoped for with Agnes von Kurowsky, a Red Cross nurse seven years his senior: the love of St. Louis native Hadley Richardson, a comfortable income, a life in Europe.\"", "Paris": "[0] is our person to focus on. Carlos Baker, [0]'s first biographer, believes that while Anderson suggested Paris because \"the monetary exchange rate\" made Paris an inexpensive place to live, more importantly Paris was where \"the most interesting people in the world\" lived. In Paris, [0] met American writer and art collector Gertrude Stein, Irish novelist James Joyce, American poet Ezra Pound (who \"could help a young writer up the rungs of a career\") and other writers.The Hemingway of the early Paris years was a \"tall, handsome, muscular, broad-shouldered, brown-eyed, rosy-cheeked, square-jawed, soft-voiced young man.\" He and Hadley lived in a small walk-up at 74 rue du Cardinal Lemoine  in the Latin Quarter, and [0] worked in a rented room in a nearby building. American writer and art collector Gertrude Stein became [0]'s mentor and godmother to [0]'s son Jack; American writer and art collector Gertrude Stein introduced [0] to the expatriate artists and writers of the Montparnasse Quarter, whom American writer and art collector Gertrude Stein referred to as the \"Lost Generation\"\u2014a term [0] popularized with the publication of The Sun Also Rises. A regular at American writer and art collector Gertrude Stein's salon, [0] met influential painters such as Pablo Picasso, Joan Mir\u00f3, and Juan Gris. [0] eventually withdrew from American writer and art collector Gertrude Stein's influence, and their relationship deteriorated into a literary quarrel that spanned decades. While living in Paris in 1922, [0] befriended artist Henry Strater who painted two portraits of [0].American poet Ezra Pound (who \"could help a young writer up the rungs of a career\") met [0] by chance at Sylvia Beach's bookshop Shakespeare and Company in 1922. The two toured Italy in 1923 and lived on the same street in 1924. The two forged a strong friendship, and in [0], American poet Ezra Pound (who \"could help a young writer up the rungs of a career\") recognized and fostered a young talent. American poet Ezra Pound (who \"could help a young writer up the rungs of a career\") introduced [0] to James Joyce, with whom [0] frequently embarked on \"alcoholic sprees\".During [0]'s first 20 months in Paris, [0] filed 88 stories for the Toronto Star newspaper. [0] covered the Greco-Turkish War, where [0] witnessed the burning of Smyrna, and wrote travel pieces such as \"Tuna Fishing in Spain\" and \"Trout Fishing All Across Europe: Spain Has the Best, Then Germany\".[0] was devastated on learning that Hadley had lost a suitcase filled with his manuscripts at the Gare de Lyon as Hadley was traveling to Geneva to meet [0] in December 1922. In the following September He and Hadley returned to Toronto, where their son John Hadley Nicanor was born on October 10, 1923. During He and Hadley's absence, Hemingway's first book, Three Stories and Ten Poems, was published. Two of the stories Hemingway's first book, Three Stories and Ten Poems, contained were all that remained after losta suitcase filled with his manuscripts, and the third had been written early the previous year in Italy. Within months a second volume, in our time (without capitals), was published. a second volume, in our time (without capitals) included six vignettes and a dozen stories [0] had written the previous summer during [0]'s first visit to Spain[0] . [0] missed Paris, considered Toronto, where their son John Hadley Nicanor boring, and wanted to return to the life of a writer, rather than live the life of a journalist.[0], Hadley, and their son John Hadley Nicanor returned to Paris in January 1924 and moved into a new apartment on the rue Notre-Dame des Champs. [0] helped Ford Madox Ford edit The Transatlantic Review, which published works by American poet Ezra Pound (who \"could help a young writer up the rungs of a career\"), John Dos Passos, Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven, and American writer and art collector Gertrude Stein, as well as some of [0]'s own early stories such as \"Indian Camp\". When a second volume, in our time (without capitals) was published in 1925, the dust jacket bore comments from Ford Madox Ford. \"Indian Camp\" received considerable praise; Ford Madox Ford saw \"Indian Camp\" as an important early story by a young writer, and critics in the United States praised [0] for reinvigorating the short story genre with [0]'s crisp style and use of declarative sentences. Six months earlier, [0] had met F. Scott Fitzgerald, and the pair formed a friendship of \"admiration and hostility\". F. Scott Fitzgerald had published The Great Gatsby the same year: [0] read The Great Gatsby, liked The Great Gatsby, and decided [0]'s next work had to be a novel.With [0]'s , [0] first visited the Festival of San Ferm\u00edn in Pamplona, Spain, in 1923, where [0] became fascinated by bullfighting. It is at this time that [0] began to be referred to as \"Papa\", even by much older friends. Hadley would much later recall that [0] had [0]'s own nicknames for everyone and that [0] often did things for [0]'s friends; Hadley suggested that [0] liked to be looked up to. Hadley did not remember precisely how \"Papa\" came into being; however, \"Papa\" certainly stuck. The Hemingways returned to Pamplona, Spain in 1924 and a third time in June 1925; 1925 The Hemingways brought with The Hemingways a group of American and British expatriates: [0]'s Michigan boyhood friend Bill Smith, Donald Ogden Stewart, Lady Duff Twysden (recently divorced), Lady Duff Twysden (recently divorced)'s lover Pat Guthrie, and Harold Loeb. A few days after the Festival of San Ferm\u00edn in Pamplona, Spain, ended, on [0]'s birthday (July 21), [0] began to write the draft of what would become The Sun Also Rises, finishing eight weeks later.  A few months later, in December 1925, The Hemingways left to spend the winter in Schruns, Austria, where [0] began revising the manuscript extensively. Pauline Pfeiffer, who was from a wealthy Catholic family in Arkansas and had moved to Paris to work for Vogue magazine where she met the Hemingways, Pauline Pfeiffer, who was from a wealthy Catholic family in Arkansas and had moved to Paris to work for Vogue magazine where she met the Hemingways, joined The Hemingways in January. Against Hadley's advice, Pauline Pfeiffer, who was from a wealthy Catholic family in Arkansas and had moved to Paris to work for Vogue magazine where she met the Hemingways, urged [0] to sign a contract with Scribner's's. [0] left Austria for a quick trip to New York to meet with Scribner's and, on [0]'s return, began an affair with Pauline Pfeiffer, who was from a wealthy Catholic family in Arkansas and had moved to Paris to work for Vogue magazine where she met the Hemingways, during a stop in Paris, before returning to Schruns to finish revising in March.  the manuscript arrived in New York in April; [0] corrected the final proof in Paris in August 1926, and Scribner's's published The Sun Also Rises in October.The Sun Also Rises epitomized the post-war expatriate generation, received good reviews and is \"recognized as [0]'s greatest work\". [0] later wrote to [0]'s editor Max Perkins that the \"point of The Sun Also Rises\" was not so much about a generation being lost, but that \"the earth abideth forever\"; [0] believed the characters in The Sun Also Rises may have been \"battered\" but were not lost.[0]'s marriage to Hadley deteriorated as [0] was working on The Sun Also Rises. In early 1926, Hadley became aware of [0]'s affair with Pauline Pfeiffer, who was from a wealthy Catholic family in Arkansas and had moved to Paris to work for Vogue magazine where she met the Hemingways,. On He and Hadley's return to Paris, Hadley asked for a separation; in November Hadley formally requested a divorce. He and Hadley split He and Hadley's possessions while Hadley accepted [0]'s offer of the proceeds from The Sun Also Rises. He and Hadley were divorced in January 1926, and [0] married Pauline Pfeiffer, who was from a wealthy Catholic family in Arkansas and had moved to Paris to work for Vogue magazine where she met the Hemingways, in May.Before [0]'s marriage to Pauline Pfeiffer, who was from a wealthy Catholic family in Arkansas and had moved to Paris to work for Vogue magazine where she met the Hemingways,, [0] converted to Catholicism. They honeymooned in Le Grau-du-Roi, where [0] contracted anthrax, and [0] planned [0]'s next collection of short stories, Men Without Women, which was published in October 1926, and included his boxing story \"Fifty Grand\". Cosmopolitan magazine editor-in-chief Ray Long praised his boxing story \"Fifty Grand\", calling his boxing story \"Fifty Grand\", \"one of the best short stories that ever came to Cosmopolitan magazine editor-in-chief Ray Long's hands\u00a0... the best prize-fight story Cosmopolitan magazine editor-in-chief Ray Long ever read\u00a0... a remarkable piece of realism.\"By the end of 1926 Pauline, who was pregnant, wanted to move back to the United States. John Dos Passos recommended Key West, and They left Paris in March 1928. [0] suffered a severe injury in They's Paris bathroom when [0] pulled a skylight down on [0]'s head thinking [0] was pulling on a toilet chain. a severe injury left [0] with a prominent forehead scar, which he carried for the rest of his life. When [0] was asked about a prominent forehead scar, which he carried for the rest of his life, [0] was reluctant to answer. After [0]'s departure from Paris, [0] \"never again lived in a big city\".", "Key West and the Caribbean": "[0] is our person to focus on. Hemingway and Pauline traveled to Kansas City, Missouri, where their son Patrick was born on June 28, 1928. Pauline had a difficult delivery; [0] fictionalized a version of a difficult delivery as a part of A Farewell to Arms. After their son Patrick's , Hemingway and Pauline traveled to Wyoming, Massachusetts, and New York. In the winter, [0] was in New York with Bumby, about to board a train to Florida, when [0] received a cable telling [0] that his father had killed himself.[note 2] [0] was devastated, having earlier written to his father telling his father not to worry about financial difficulties; the letter arrived minutes after killed. [0] realized how Hadley must have felt after Hadley's own father's suicide in 1903, and [0] commented, \"[0]'ll probably go the same way.\"Upon [0]'s return to Key West in December, [0] worked on the draft of A Farewell to Arms before leaving for France in January. [0] had finished the draft of A Farewell to Arms in August but delayed the revision. The serialization in Scribner's Magazine was scheduled to begin in May, but as late as April, [0] was still working on the ending, which [0] may have rewritten as many as seventeen times. A Farewell to Arms was published on September 27. Biographer James Mellow believes A Farewell to Arms established [0]'s stature as a major American writer and displayed a level of complexity not apparent in The Sun Also Rises. (The story was turned into a play by war veteran Laurence Stallings that was the basis for the film starring Gary Cooper.) In Spain in mid-1929, [0] researched [0]'s next work, Death in the Afternoon. [0] wanted to write a comprehensive treatise on bullfighting, explaining the toreros and corridas complete with glossaries and appendices, because [0] believed bullfighting was \"of great tragic interest, being literally of life and death.\"During the early 1930s, [0] spent [0]'s winters in Key West and summers in Wyoming[0] [0] . [0] was joined there by Dos Passos, and in November 1930, after bringing Dos Passos to the train station in Billings, Montana, [0] broke his arm in a car accident. The surgeon tended the compound spiral fracture and bound his arm with kangaroo tendon. [0] was hospitalized for seven weeks, with Pauline tending to [0]; the nerves in [0]'s writing hand took as long as a year to heal, during which time [0] suffered intense pain.[0]'s third child, Gloria Hemingway, was born a year later on November 12, 1931, in Kansas City as \"Gregory Hancock Hemingway\". Pauline's uncle bought Hemingway and Pauline a house in Key West with a carriage house, the second floor of which was converted into a writing studio. While in Key West, [0] frequented the local bar Sloppy Joe's. [0] invited friends\u2014including Waldo Peirce, Dos Passos, and Max Perkins\u2014to join [0] on fishing trips and on an all-male expedition to the Dry Tortugas. Meanwhile, [0] continued to travel to Europe and to Cuba, and\u2014although in 1933 [0] wrote of Key West, \"Hemingway and Pauline have a fine house here, and kids are all well\"\u2014Mellow believes [0] \"was plainly restless\".In 1933, Hemingway and Pauline went on safari to Kenya. safari to Kenya provided material for Green Hills of Africa, as well as for the short stories \"The Snows of Kilimanjaro\" and \"The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber\". Hemingway and Pauline visited Mombasa, Nairobi, and Machakos in Kenya; then moved on to Tanganyika Territory, where Hemingway and Pauline hunted in the Serengeti, around Lake Manyara, and west and southeast of present-day Tarangire National Park. Hemingway and Pauline's guide was the noted \"white hunter\" Philip Percival who had guided Theodore Roosevelt on Theodore Roosevelt's 1909 safari. During these travels, [0] contracted amoebic dysentery that caused a prolapsed intestine, and [0] was evacuated by plane to Nairobi, an experience reflected in \"The Snows of Kilimanjaro\". On [0]'s return to Key West in early 1934, [0] began work on Green Hills of Africa, which [0] published in 1935 to mixed reviews.[0] bought a boat in 1934, named a boat the Pilar, and began sailing the Caribbean. In 1935 [0] first arrived at Bimini, where [0] spent a considerable amount of time. During this period [0] also worked on To Have and Have Not, published in 1937 while [0] was in Spain, the only novel [0] wrote during the 1930s.", "Spanish Civil War": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 1937, [0] left for Spain to cover the Spanish Civil War for the North American Newspaper Alliance (NANA), despite Pauline's's reluctance to have [0] working in a war zone. He and Dos Passos He and Dos Passos signed on to work with Dutch filmmaker Joris Ivens as screenwriters for The Spanish Earth. Dos Passos left The Spanish Earth after the execution of Jos\u00e9 Robles, Dos Passos's friend and Spanish translator, which caused a rift between He and Dos Passos.[0] was joined in Spain by journalist and writer Martha Gellhorn, whom he had met in Key West a year earlier. Like Hadley, journalist and writer Martha Gellhorn, whom he had met in Key West a year earlier was a St. Louis native and, like Pauline's, journalist and writer Martha Gellhorn, whom he had met in Key West a year earlier had worked for Vogue in Paris. Of journalist and writer Martha Gellhorn, whom he had met in Key West a year earlier, Kert explains, \"journalist and writer Martha Gellhorn, whom he had met in Key West a year earlier never catered to [0] the way other women did\". In July 1937 [0] attended the Second International Writers' Congress, the purpose of which was to discuss the attitude of intellectuals to the Spanish Civil War, held in Valencia, Barcelona and Madrid and attended by many writers including Andr\u00e9 Malraux, Stephen Spender and Pablo Neruda. Late in 1937, while in Madrid with journalist and writer Martha Gellhorn, whom he had met in Key West a year earlier, [0] wrote [0]'s only play, The Fifth Column, as Madrid was being bombarded by Francoist forces. [0] returned to Key West for a few months, then back to Spain twice in 1938, where [0] was present at the Battle of the Ebro, the last republican stand, and [0] was among the British and American journalists who were some of the last to leave the battle as they crossed the riverthe British and American journalists who were some of the last to leave the battle as they crossed the river .", "Cuba": "[0] is our person to focus on. In early 1939, [0] crossed to Cuba in [0]'s boat to live in the Hotel Ambos Mundos in Havana. This was the separation phase of a slow and painful split from Pauline, which began when [0] met Martha Gellhorn. Martha Gellhorn soon joined [0] in Cuba, and they rented \"Finca Vig\u00eda\" (\"Lookout Farm\"), a 15-acre (61,000\u00a0m2) property 15 miles (24\u00a0km) from Havana. Pauline and the children left [0] that summer, after the family was reunited during a visit to Wyoming; when [0]'s divorce from Pauline was finalized, [0] Martha Gellhorn were married on November 20, 1940, in Cheyenne, Wyoming.[0] moved [0]'s primary summer residence to Ketchum, Idaho, just outside the newly built resort of Sun Valley, and moved [0]'s winter residence to Cuba. [0] had been disgusted when a Parisian friend allowed his cats to eat from the table, but [0] became enamored of cats in Cuba and kept dozens of his cats on \"Finca Vig\u00eda\" (\"Lookout Farm\"), a 15-acre (61,000\u00a0m2) property 15 miles (24\u00a0km) from Havana. Descendants of his cats live at [0]'s Key West home.Martha Gellhorn inspired [0] to write his most famous novel, For Whom the Bell Tolls, which he began in March 1939 and finished in July 1940. his most famous novel, For Whom the Bell Tolls, which he began in March 1939 and finished in July 1940 was published in October 1940. [0]'s pattern was to move around while working on a manuscript, and [0] wrote For Whom the Bell Tolls in Cuba, Wyoming, and the newly built resort of Sun Valley. his most famous novel, For Whom the Bell Tolls, which he began in March 1939 and finished in July 1940 became a Book-of-the-Month Club choice, sold half a million copies within months, was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize and, in the words of Meyers, \"triumphantly re-established [0]'s literary reputation\".In January 1941, Martha Gellhorn was sent to China on assignment for Collier's magazine. [0] went with Martha Gellhorn, sending in dispatches for the newspaper PM, but in general [0] disliked China.A 2009 book by former KGB officer Alexander Vassiliev suggests during that period [0] may have been recruited to work for NKVD \"on ideological grounds\" under the code name \"Argo\".they returned to Cuba before the declaration of war by the United States that December, when [0] convinced Cuba to help [0] refit the Pilar, which [0] intended to use to ambush German submarines off the coast of Cuba.", "World War II": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was in Europe from May 1944 to March 1945. When [0] arrived in London, [0] met Time magazine correspondent Mary Welsh, with whom he became infatuated. Time magazine correspondent Mary Welsh, with whom he became infatuated had been forced to cross the Atlantic in a ship filled with explosives because [0] refused to help Time magazine correspondent Mary Welsh, with whom he became infatuated get a press pass on a plane, and Time magazine correspondent Mary Welsh, with whom he became infatuated arrived in London to find [0] hospitalized with a concussion from a car accident. Time magazine correspondent Mary Welsh, with whom he became infatuated was unsympathetic to [0]'s plight; Time magazine correspondent Mary Welsh, with whom he became infatuated accused [0] of being a bully and told [0] that Time magazine correspondent Mary Welsh, with whom he became infatuated was \"through, absolutely finished\". The last time that [0] saw Time magazine correspondent Mary Welsh, with whom he became infatuated was in March 1945 as [0] was preparing to return to Cuba, and their's divorce was finalized later that year. Meanwhile, [0] had asked Time magazine correspondent Mary Welsh, with whom he became infatuated to marry [0] on their's third meeting.[0] accompanied the troops to the Normandy Landings wearing a large head bandage, according to Meyers, but [0] was considered \"precious cargo\" and not allowed ashore. The landing craft came within sight of Omaha Beach before coming under enemy fire and turning back. [0] later wrote in Collier's that [0] could see \"the first, second, third, fourth and fifth waves of [landing troops] lay where the first, second, third, fourth and fifth waves of [landing troops had fallen, looking like so many heavily laden bundles on the flat pebbly stretch between the sea and first cover\". Meyers explains that, on that first day, none of the correspondents were allowed to land and [0] was returned to the Dorothea Dix.Late in July, [0] attached [0] to \"the 22nd Infantry Regiment commanded by Col. Charles \"Buck\" Lanham, as the 22nd Infantry Regiment commanded by Col. Charles \"Buck\" Lanham drove toward Paris\", and [0] became de facto leader to a small band of village militia in Rambouillet outside of Paris. Paul Fussell remarks: \"[0] got into considerable trouble playing infantry captain to a group of Resistance people that [0] gathered because a correspondent is not supposed to lead troops, even if a correspondent does lead well.\" lead was in fact in contravention of the Geneva Convention,  and [0] was brought up on formal charges; [0] said that [0] \"beat the rap\" by claiming that [0] only offered advice.On August 25, [0] was present at the liberation of Paris as a journalist; contrary to the [0] legend, [0] was not the first into Paris, nor did [0] liberate the Ritz. In Paris, [0] visited Sylvia Beach and Pablo Picasso with Mary Welsh, who joined [0] there; in a spirit of happiness, [0] forgave Gertrude Stein. Later that year, [0] observed heavy fighting in the Battle of H\u00fcrtgen Forest. On December 17, 1944, [0] had [0] driven to Luxembourg in spite of illness to cover The Battle of the Bulge. As soon as [0] arrived, however, Col. Charles \"Buck\" Lanham handed [0] to the doctors, who hospitalized [0] with pneumonia; [0] recovered a week later, but most of the fighting was over.In 1947, [0] was awarded a Bronze Star for [0]'s bravery during World War II. [0] was recognized for having been \"under fire in combat areas in order to obtain an accurate picture of conditions\", with the commendation that \"through [0]'s talent of expression, [0] enabled readers to obtain a vivid picture of the difficulties and triumphs of the front-line soldier and the front-line soldier's organization in combat\".", "Cuba and the Nobel Prize": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] said [0] \"was out of business as a writer\" from 1942 to 1945 during [0]'s residence in Cuba. In 1946 [0] married Mary, who had an ectopic pregnancy five months later. The Hemingway family suffered a series of accidents and health problems in the years following the war: in a 1945 car accident, [0] \"smashed [0]'s knee\" and sustained another \"deep wound on [0]'s forehead\"; Mary, who had an ectopic pregnancy five months later broke first Mary, who had an ectopic pregnancy five months later's right ankle and then Mary, who had an ectopic pregnancy five months later left in successive skiing accidents. A 1947 car accident left Patrick with a head wound and severely ill. [0] sank into depression as [0]'s literary friends began to die: in 1939 William Butler Yeats and Ford Madox Ford; in 1940 F. Scott Fitzgerald; in 1941 Sherwood Anderson and James Joyce; in 1946 Gertrude Stein; and the following year in 1947, Max Perkins, [0]'s long-time Scribner's editor, and friend. During this period, [0] suffered from severe headaches, high blood pressure, weight problems, and eventually diabetes\u2014much of which was the result of previous accidents and many years of heavy drinking. Nonetheless, in January 1946, [0] began work on The Garden of Eden, finishing 800 pages by June.[note 3] During this period, [0] also began work on a trilogy tentatively titled \"The Land\", \"The Sea\" and \"The Air\", which [0] wanted to combine in one novel titled The Sea Book.  However, both projects stalled, and Mellow says that [0]'s inability to continue was \"a symptom of [0]'s troubles\" during these years.[note 4]In 1948, Hemingway and Mary Mary, who had an ectopic pregnancy five months later traveled to Europe, staying in Venice for several months. While there, [0] fell in love with the then 19-year-old Adriana Ivancich. The platonic love affair inspired the novel Across the River and into the Trees, written in Cuba during a time of strife with Mary, and published in 1950 to negative reviews. The following year, furious at the critical reception of the novel Across the River and into the Trees, written in Cuba during a time of strife with Mary, and published in 1950 to negative reviews, [0] wrote the draft of The Old Man and the Sea in eight weeks, saying that the draft of The Old Man and the Sea was \"the best [0] can write ever for all of [0]'s life\". the novel Across the River and into the Trees, written in Cuba during a time of strife with Mary, and published in 1950 to negative reviews became a book-of-the-month selection, made [0] an international celebrity, and won the Pulitzer Prize in May 1953, a month before [0] left for [0]'s second trip to Africa.In January 1954, while in Africa, [0] was almost fatally injured in two successive plane crashes. [0] chartered a sightseeing flight over the Belgian Congo as a Christmas present to Mary, who had an ectopic pregnancy five months later. On Hemingway and Mary's way to photograph Murchison Falls from the air, a sightseeing flight over the Belgian Congo struck an abandoned utility pole and \"crash landed in heavy brush\". Hemingway's injuries included a head wound, while Mary, who had an ectopic pregnancy five months later broke two ribs. The next day, attempting to reach medical care in Entebbe, Hemingway and Mary boarded a second plane that exploded at take-off, with [0] suffering burns and another concussion, this one serious enough to cause leaking of cerebral fluid. Hemingway and Mary eventually arrived in Entebbe to find reporters covering the story of Hemingway's death. [0] briefed reporters covering the story of Hemingway's death and spent the next few weeks recuperating and reading [0]'s erroneous obituaries. Despite Hemingway's injuries, [0] accompanied Patrick and Patrick's wife on a planned fishing expedition in February, but pain caused [0] to be irascible and difficult to get along with. When a bushfire broke out, [0] was again injured, sustaining second-degree burns on [0]'s legs, front torso, lips, left hand and right forearm. Months later in Venice, Mary, who had an ectopic pregnancy five months later reported to friends the full extent of Hemingway's injuries: two cracked discs, a kidney and liver rupture, a dislocated shoulder and a broken skull. two successive plane crashes may have precipitated the physical deterioration that was to follow. After two successive plane crashes, [0][0]'s , drank more heavily than usual to combat the pain of Hemingway's injuries.\"In October 1954, [0] received the Nobel Prize in Literature. [0] modestly told the press that Carl Sandburg, Isak Dinesen and Bernard Berenson deserved the Nobel Prize in Literature, but [0] gladly accepted the prize money. Mellow says [0] \"had coveted the Nobel Prize in Literature\", but when [0] won the Nobel Prize in Literature, months after two successive plane crashes and the ensuing worldwide press coverage, \"there must have been a lingering suspicion in [0]'s mind that [0]'s obituary notices had played a part in the academy's decision.\" Because [0] was suffering pain from the African accidents, [0] decided against traveling to Stockholm. Instead [0] sent a speech to be read, defining [0]'s life:Writing, at Writing's best, is a lonely life. Organizations for writers palliate [0]'s loneliness but [0] doubt if Organizations for writers improve [0]'s writing. [0] grows in public stature as [0] sheds [0]'s loneliness and often his work deteriorates. For [0] does his work alone and if [0] is a good enough writer [0] must face eternity, or the lack of eternity, each day. From the end of the year in 1955 to early 1956, [0] was bedridden. [0] was told to stop drinking to mitigate liver damage, advice [0] initially followed but then disregarded. In October 1956, [0] returned to Europe and met Basque writer Pio Baroja, who was seriously ill and died weeks later. During the trip, [0] became sick again and was treated for \"high blood pressure, liver disease, and arteriosclerosis\".In November 1956, while staying in Paris, [0] was reminded of trunks he had stored in the Ritz Hotel in 1928 and never retrieved. Upon re-claiming and opening trunks he had stored in the Ritz Hotel in 1928 and never retrieved, [0] discovered trunks he had stored in the Ritz Hotel in 1928 and never retrieved were filled with notebooks and writing from his Paris years. Excited about the discovery, when [0] returned to Cuba in early 1957, [0] began to shape notebooks and writing from his Paris years into [0]'s memoir A Moveable Feast. By 1959 [0] ended a period of intense activity: [0] finished A Moveable Feast (scheduled to be released the following year); brought True at First Light to 200,000 words; added chapters to The Garden of Eden; and worked on Islands in the Stream. The last three were stored in a safe deposit box in Havana, as [0] focused on the finishing touches for A Moveable Feast. Author Michael Reynolds claims it was during this period that [0] slid into depression, from which [0] was unable to recover.The Finca Vig\u00eda became crowded with guests and tourists, as [0], beginning to become unhappy with life there, considered a permanent move to Idaho. In 1959 [0] bought a home overlooking the Big Wood River, outside Ketchum, and left Cuba\u2014although [0] apparently remained on easy terms with CubaCastro , telling The New York Times [0] was \"delighted\" with Castro's overthrow of Batista. [0] was in Cuba in November 1959, between returning from Pamplona and traveling west to Idaho, and the following year for [0]'s 61st birthday; however, the following year Hemingway and Mary Mary, who had an ectopic pregnancy five months later decided to leave after hearing the news that Castro wanted to nationalize property owned by Americans and other foreign nationals. On July 25, 1960, Hemingway and Mary left Cuba for the last time, leaving art and manuscripts in a bank vault in Havana. After the 1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion, The Finca Vig\u00eda was expropriated by Cuba, complete with [0]'s collection of \"four to six thousand books\". President Kennedy arranged for Mary, who had an ectopic pregnancy five months later to travel to Cuba Mary, who had an ectopic pregnancy five months later Castro Mary, who had an ectopic pregnancy five months later's in return for donating The Finca Vig\u00eda to Cuba.[clarification needed]", "Idaho and suicide": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] continued to rework the material that was published as A Moveable Feast through the 1950s. In mid-1959, [0] visited Spain to research a series of bullfighting articles commissioned by Life magazine. Life magazine wanted only 10,000\u00a0words, but the manuscript grew out of control. [0] was unable to organize [0]'s writing for the first time in his life, so [0] asked A. E. Hotchner to travel to Cuba to help [0]. A. E. Hotchner helped [0] trim a series of bullfighting articles commissioned by Life magazine down to 40,000 words, and Scribner's agreed to a full-length book version (The Dangerous Summer) of almost 130,000 words. A. E. Hotchner found [0] to be \"unusually hesitant, disorganized, and confused\", and suffering badly from failing eyesight.Hemingway and Mary left Cuba for the last time on July 25, 1960. [0] set up a small office in his New York City apartment and attempted to work, but [0] left soon after. [0] then traveled alone to Spain to be photographed for the front cover of Life magazine. A few days later, the news reported that [0] was seriously ill and on the verge of dying, which panicked Mary until Mary received a cable from [0] telling Mary, \"Reports false. Enroute Madrid. Love [0].\" [0] was, in fact, seriously ill, and believed [0] to be on the verge of a breakdown. Feeling lonely, [0] took to [0]'s bed for days, retreating into silence, despite having the first installments of The Dangerous Summer published in Life magazine in September 1960 to good reviews. In October, [0] left Spain for New York, where [0] refused to leave his New York City apartment, presuming that [0] was being watched. Mary quickly took [0] to Idaho, where physician George Saviers met Hemingway and Mary at the train.[0] was constantly worried about money and [0]'s safety. [0] worried about [0]'s taxes and that [0] would never return to Cuba to retrieve the manuscripts that [0] had left in a bank vault. [0] became paranoid, thinking that the FBI was actively monitoring [0]'s movements in Ketchum.[clarification needed] the FBI had opened a file on [0] during World War II, when [0] used the Pilar to patrol the waters off Cuba, and J. Edgar Hoover had an agent in Havana watch [0] during the 1950s. Unable to care for [0], Mary had physician George Saviers fly [0] to the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota at the end of November for hypertension treatments, as physician George Saviers told physician George Saviers's patient.  the FBI knew that [0] was at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, as an agent later documented in a letter written in January [0] was checked in under physician George Saviers's name to maintain anonymity. Meyers writes that \"an aura of secrecy surrounds [0]'s treatment at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota\" but confirms that [0] was treated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) as many as 15 times in December 1960 and was \"released in ruins\" in January 1961. Reynolds gained access to [0]'s records at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, which document ten ECT sessions. The doctors in Rochester told [0] the depressive state for which [0] was being treated may have been caused by [0]'s long-term use of Reserpine and Ritalin. Of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), [0] told A. E. Hotchner, \"What is the sense of ruining [0]'s head and erasing [0]'s memory, which is [0]'s capital, and putting [0] out of business? electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) was a brilliant cure, but we lost the patient.[0] was back in Ketchum.[clarification in April 1961, three months after being released from the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, when Mary \"found [0] holding a shotgun\" in the kitchen one morning. Mary called physician George Saviers and once the weather cleared physician George Saviers flew again to Rochester with physician George Saviers's . [0] underwent three electroshock treatments during that visit. [0] was released at the end of June and was home in Ketchum.[clarification on June 30. Two days later [0] \"quite deliberately\" shot [0] with his favorite shotgun in the early morning hours of July 2, 1961.

His sister Ursula and his brother Leicester also killed His sister Ursula and his brother Leicester.  [0]'s health was further complicated by heavy drinking throughout most of his life.A memorial to [0] just north of Sun Valley is inscribed on the base with a eulogy [0] had written for a friend several decades earlier:"}, "Writing style": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. The New York Times wrote in 1926 of [0]'s first novel,  \"No amount of analysis can convey the quality of The Sun Also Rises. The Sun Also Rises is a truly gripping story, told in a lean, hard, athletic narrative prose that puts more literary English to shame.\" The Sun Also Rises is written in the spare, tight prose that made [0] famous, and, according to James Nagel, \"changed the nature of American writing\". In 1954, when [0] was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, awarded was for \"[0]'s mastery of the art of narrative, most recently demonstrated in The Old Man and the Sea, and for the influence that [0] has exerted on contemporary style.\"If a writer of prose knows enough of what a writer of prose is writing about a writer of prose may omit things that he knows and the reader, if a writer of prose is writing truly enough, will have a feeling of things that he knows as strongly as though a writer of prose had stated things that he knows. The dignity of movement of an ice-berg is due to only one-eighth of an ice-berg being above water. A writer who omits things because he does not know them A writer who omits things because he does not know them only makes hollow places in A writer who omits things because he does not know them's writing.\u2014Ernest Hemingway in Death in the AfternoonHenry Louis Gates believes Hemingway's style was fundamentally shaped \"in reaction to [[0]'s] experience of world war\". After world war, [0] and other modernists \"lost faith in the central institutions of Western civilization\" by reacting against the elaborate style of 19th-century writers and by creating a style \"in which meaning is established through dialogue, through action, and silences\u2014a fiction in which nothing crucial\u2014or at least very little\u2014is stated explicitly.\"Because [0] began as a writer of short stories, Louis Gates believes [0] learned to \"get the most from the least, how to prune language, how to multiply intensities and how to tell nothing but the truth in a way that allowed for telling more than the truth.\" [0] called Hemingway's style the iceberg theory: the facts float above water; the supporting structure and symbolism operate out of sight. The concept of the iceberg theory is sometimes referred to as the \"theory of omission\". [0] believed [0] could describe one thing (such as Nick Adams fishing in \"Big Two-Hearted River\") though an entirely different thing occurs below the surface (Nick Adams concentrating on fishing to the extent that Nick Adams does not have to think about anything else).  Paul Smith writes that [0]'s first stories, collected as In Our Time, showed [0] was still experimenting with [0]'s writing style, and when [0] wrote about Spain or other countries [0] incorporated foreign words into the text, which sometimes appears directly in the other language (in italics, as occurs in The Old Man and the Sea) or in English as literal translations. [0] also often used bilingual puns and crosslingual wordplay as stylistic devices. In general, [0] avoided complicated syntax. About 70 percent of the sentences are simple sentences without subordination\u2014a simple childlike grammar structure.Jackson Benson believes [0] used autobiographical details as framing devices about life in general\u2014not only about [0]'s life. For example, Jackson Benson postulates that [0] used his experiences and drew his experiences out with \"what if\" scenarios: \"what if [0] were wounded in such a way that [0] could not sleep at night? What if [0] were wounded and made crazy, what would happen if [0] were sent back to the front?\"  Writing in \"The Art of the Short Story\", [0] explains: \"A few things [0] have found to be true. If you leave out important things or events that you know about, the story is strengthened. If you leave or skip something because you do not know something, the story will be worthless. The test of any story is how very good the stuff that you, not your editors, omit.\"The simplicity of the prose is deceptive. Zoe Trodd believes [0] crafted skeletal sentences in response to Henry James's observation that world war had \"used up words\". [0] offers a \"multi-focal\" photographic reality. [0]'s iceberg theory of omission is the foundation on which [0] builds. The syntax, which lacks subordinating conjunctions, creates static sentences. The photographic \"snapshot\" style creates a collage of images. Many types of internal punctuation (colons, semicolons, dashes, parentheses) are omitted in favor of short declarative sentences. short declarative sentences build on each other, as events build to create a sense of the whole. Multiple strands exist in one story; an \"embedded text\" bridges to a different angle. [0] also uses other cinematic techniques of \"cutting\" quickly from one scene to the next; or of \"splicing\" a scene into another. Intentional omissions allow the reader to fill the gap, as though responding to instructions from [0] and create three-dimensional prose.In the late summer that year we lived in a house in a village that looked across the river and the plain to the mountains. In the bed of the river there were pebbles and boulders, dry and white in the sun, and the water was clear and swiftly moving and blue in the channels. Troops went by a house and down the road and the dust Troops raised powdered the trees.\u2014Opening passage of A Farewell to Arms showing [0]'s use of the word [0] habitually used the word \"and\" in place of commas. This use of polysyndeton may serve to convey immediacy. Hemingway's polysyndetonic sentence\u2014or in later works [0]'s use of subordinate clauses\u2014uses conjunctions to juxtapose startling visions and images.  Jackson Benson compares Hemingway's polysyndetonic sentence to haikus. Many of [0]'s followers misinterpreted [0]'s lead and frowned upon all expression of emotion; Saul Bellow satirized this style as \"Do you have emotions? Strangle emotions.\" However, [0]'s intent was not to eliminate emotion, but to portray emotion more scientifically. [0] thought it would be easy, and pointless, to describe emotions; [0] sculpted collages of images in order to grasp \"the real thing, the sequence of motion and fact which made the emotion and which would be as valid in a year or in ten years or, with luck and if you stated the emotion purely enough, always\". This use of an image as an objective correlative is characteristic of Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot, James Joyce, and Marcel Proust. [0]'s letters refer to Marcel Proust's Remembrance of Things Past several times over the years, and indicate Marcel Proust read the book at least twice."}, "Themes": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. Hemingway's writing includes themes of love, war, travel, wilderness, and loss. Critic Leslie Fiedler sees the theme Critic Leslie Fiedler defines as \"The Sacred Land\"\u2014the American West\u2014extended in Hemingway's writing to include mountains in Spain, Switzerland and Africa, and to the streams of Michigan. The American West is given a symbolic nod with the naming of the \"Hotel Montana\" in The Sun Also Rises and For Whom the Bell Tolls.  According to Stoltzfus and Critic Leslie Fiedler, in Hemingway's writing, nature is a place for rebirth and rest; and nature is where the hunter or fisherman might experience a moment of transcendence at the moment the hunter or fisherman kill the hunter or fisherman's prey. nature is where men exist without women: men fish; men hunt; men find redemption in nature. Although [0] does write about sports, such as fishing, Carlos Baker notes the emphasis is more on the athlete than sports, such as fishing. At its core, much of [0]'s work can be viewed in the light of American naturalism, evident in detailed descriptions such as those in \"Big Two-Hearted River\".[0] often wrote about Americans abroad. In [0]'s Expatriate Nationalism, Jeffrey Herlihy describes \"[0]'s Transnational Archetype\" as one that involves characters who are \"multilingual and bicultural, and have integrated new cultural norms from the host community into their daily lives by the time plots begincharacters who are \"multilingual and bicultural, and have integrated new cultural norms from the host community into their daily lives by the time plots begin's .\" In this way, \"foreign scenarios, far from being mere exotic backdrops or cosmopolitan milieus, are motivating factors in-character action.\" Donald Monk comments that [0]'s use of \"expatriation comes to be not so much a psychological as a metaphysical reality. expatriation guarantees [0]'s world-view of [0]'s heroes, based on a type of rootless outsider.Critic Leslie Fiedler believes [0] inverts the American literary theme of the evil \"Dark Woman\" versus the good \"Light Woman\". The dark woman\u2014Brett Ashley of The Sun Also Rises\u2014is a goddess; the light woman\u2014Margot Macomber of \"The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber\"\u2014is a murderess. Robert Scholes says early [0] stories, such as \"A Very Short Story\", present \"a male character favorably and a female unfavorably\".  According to Rena Sanderson, early [0] critics lauded [0]'s male-centric world of masculine pursuits, and the fiction divided women into \"castrators or love-slaves\". Feminist critics attacked [0] as \"public enemy number one\", although more recent re-evaluations of [0]'s work \"have given new visibility to Hemingway's female characters (and Hemingway's female characters's strengths) and have revealed [0]'s own sensitivity to gender issues, thus casting doubts on the old assumption that [0]'s writings were one-sidedly masculine.\" Nina Baym believes that Brett Ashley of The Sun Also Rises and Margot Macomber of \"The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber\"\u2014is \"are the two outstanding examples of [0]'s 'bitch women.'\"The world breaks everyone and afterward many are strong in the broken places. But those that will not break it kills. it kills the very good and the very gentle and the very brave impartially. If you are none of the very good and the very gentle and the very brave you can be sure it will kill you too but there will be no special hurry.\u2014Ernest Hemingway in A Farewell to ArmsThe theme of women and death is evident in stories as early as \"Indian Camp\". The theme of death permeates Hemingway's writing. Young believes the emphasis in \"Indian Camp\" was not so much on the woman who gives birth or the father who kills himselfthe father who kills himself, but on Nick Adams who witnesses these events as a child, and becomes a \"badly scarred and nervous young man\". [0] sets the events in \"Indian Camp\" that shape the Nick Adams who witnesses these events as a child, and becomes a \"badly scarred and nervous young man\" persona. Young believes \"Indian Camp\" holds the \"master key\" to \"what \"Indian Camp\"'s was up to for some thirty-five years of [0]'s writing career\". Stoltzfus considers Hemingway's writing to be more complex with a representation of the truth inherent in existentialism: if \"nothingness\" is embraced, then redemption is achieved at the moment of death. Those who face death with dignity and courage live an authentic life. Margot Macomber of \"The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber\"\u2014is dies happy because the last hours of Margot Macomber of \"The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber\"\u2014is's life are authentic; the bullfighter in the corrida represents the pinnacle of a life lived with authenticity. In his's paper The Uses of Authenticity: [0] and the Literary Field, his writes that [0]'s fiction is successful because the characters live an \"authentic life\", and the \"soldiers, fishers, boxers and backwoodsmen are among the archetypes of authenticity in modern literature\".The theme of emasculation is prevalent in Hemingway's work, notably in God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen and The Sun Also Rises. Emasculation, according to Critic Leslie Fiedler, is a result of a generation of wounded soldiers; and of a generation in which women such as Brett Ashley of The Sun Also Rises gained emancipation. This also applies to the minor character, Frances Clyne, Cohn's girlfriend in the beginning of The Sun Also Rises. the minor character, Frances Clyne, Cohn's girlfriend in the beginning of The Sun Also Rises supports The theme of emasculation not only because The theme of emasculation was presented early on in The Sun Also Rises but also the impact the minor character, Frances Clyne, Cohn's girlfriend in the beginning of The Sun Also Rises had on Cohn's in the start of The Sun Also Rises while only appearing a small number of times. In God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen, the emasculation is literal, and related to religious guilt. Carlos Baker believes Hemingway's work emphasizes the \"natural\" versus the \"unnatural\". In \"Indian Camp\" the \"unnaturalness\" of skiing in the high country late spring snow is juxtaposed against the \"unnaturalness\" of the peasant who allowed his wife's dead body to linger too long in the shed during the winterthe peasant who allowed his wife's dead body to linger too long in the shed during the winter's . The skiers and peasant retreat to the valley to the \"natural\" spring for redemption.Descriptions of food and drink feature prominently in many of [0]'s works. In the short story \"Big Two-Hearted River\" [0] describes a hungry Nick Adams cooking a can of pork and beans and a can of spaghetti over a fire in a heavy cast iron pot. The primitive act of preparing the meal in solitude is a restorative act and one of [0]'s narratives of post-war integration.Susan Beegel reports that Charles Stetler and Gerald Locklin read [0]'s The Mother of a Queen as both misogynistic and homophobic, and Ernest Fontana thought that a \"horror of homosexuality\" drove the short story \"A Pursuit Race\". Susan Beegel found that \"despite the academy's growing interest in multiculturalism ... during the 1980s ... critics interested in multiculturalism tended to ignore [0] as 'politically incorrect.'\", listing just two \"apologetic articles on [[0]'s] handling of race\". Barry Gross, comparing Jewish characters in literature of the period, commented that \"[0] never lets the reader forget that Cohn's is a Jew, not an unattractive character who happens to be a Jew but a character who is unattractive because Cohn's is a Jew.\""}, "Influence and legacy": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0]'s legacy to American literature is his style: writers who came after [0] either emulated or avoided his style. After [0]'s reputation was established with the publication of The Sun Also Rises, [0] became the spokesperson for the post-World War\u00a0I generation, having established a style to follow. [0]'s books were burned in Berlin in 1933, \"as being a monument of modern decadence\", and disavowed by [0]'s parents as \"filth\". Reynolds asserts the legacy is that \"[[0]] left stories and novels so starkly moving that some have become part of our cultural heritage.\"Benson believes the details of [0]'s life have become a \"prime vehicle for exploitation\", resulting in a [0] industry. [0] scholar Hallengren believes the \"hard-boiled style\" and the machismo must be separated from [0]. \"Benson agrees, describing [0] as introverted and private as J. D. Salinger, although [0] masked [0]'s nature with braggadocio. During World War\u00a0II, J. D. Salinger met and corresponded with [0]J. D. Salinger .  In a letter to [0], J. D. Salinger claimed their talks \"had given J. D. Salinger J. D. Salinger's only hopeful minutes of World War\u00a0II\" and jokingly \"named J. D. Salinger national chairman of the [0] Fan Clubs\".The extent of his influence is seen from the enduring and varied tributes to [0] and [0]'s works. 3656 Hemingway, a minor planet discovered in 1978 by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Chernykh, was named for [0], and in 2009, a crater on Mercury was also named in [0]'s honor.
