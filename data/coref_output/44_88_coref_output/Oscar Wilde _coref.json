{"summary": {"": "[0]  is our person to focus on. [0] (16 October 1854\u00a0\u2013 30 November 1900) was an Irish poet and playwright. After writing in different forms throughout the 1880s, [0] became one of the most popular playwrights in London in the early 1890s. [0] is best remembered for [0]'s epigrams and plays, his novel The Picture of Dorian Gray, and [0]'s criminal conviction for gross indecency for homosexual acts.[0]'s parents were Anglo-Irish intellectuals in Dublin. In [0]'s youth [0] learned to speak fluent French and German. At university, [0] read Greats; [0] demonstrated [0] to be an exceptional classicist, first at Trinity College Dublin, then at Magdalen College, Oxford. [0] became associated with the emerging philosophy of aestheticism, led by two of [0]'s tutors, Walter Pater and John Ruskin. After university, [0] moved to London into fashionable cultural and social circles.As a spokesman for aestheticism, [0] tried [0]'s hand at various literary activities: [0] published a book of poems, lectured in the United States and Canada on the new \"English Renaissance in Art\" and interior decoration, and then returned to London[0] . Known for [0]'s biting wit, flamboyant dress and glittering conversational skill, [0] became one of the best-known personalities of [0]'s day. At the turn of the early 1890s [0] refined [0]'s ideas about the supremacy of art in a series of dialogues and essays, and incorporated themes of decadence, duplicity, and beauty into what would be his novel The Picture of Dorian Gray. The opportunity to construct aesthetic details precisely, and combine aesthetic details with larger social themes, drew [0] to write drama. [0] wrote Salome (1891) in French while in Paris, but Salome (1891) was refused a licence for the United States due to an absolute prohibition on the portrayal of Biblical subjects on the English stage. Undiscouraged, [0] produced four society comedies in the early 1890s, which made [0] one of the most successful playwrights of London.At the height of [0]'s fame and success, while The Importance of Being Earnest (1895) was still being performed in London, [0] prosecuted the Marquess of Queensberry for criminal libel. the Marquess of Queensberry was the father of [0]'s lover, Lord Alfred Douglas. prosecuted unearthed evidence that caused [0] to drop [0]'s charges and led to [0]'s own arrest and trial for gross indecency with men. After two more trials [0] was convicted and sentenced to two years' hard labour, the maximum penalty, and was jailed from 1895 to 1897. During [0]'s last year in prison [0] wrote De Profundis (published posthumously in 1905), a long letter that discusses [0]'s spiritual journey through [0]'s trials, forming a dark counterpoint to [0]'s earlier philosophy of pleasure. On [0]'s release, [0] left immediately for France, and never returned to Ireland or Britain. There [0] wrote [0]'s last work, The Ballad of Reading Gaol (1898), a long poem commemorating the harsh rhythms of prison life."}, "Early life": {"": "[0]  is our person to focus on. [0] was born at 21 Westland Row, Dublin (now home of the Oscar Wilde Centre, Trinity College), the second of three children born to an Anglo-Irish couple: Jane, n\u00e9e Elgee, and Sir William Wilde. [0] was two years younger than his brother, William (Willie) Wilde.Jane was a niece (by marriage) of the novelist, playwright and clergyman Charles Maturin (1780\u20131824), who may have influenced Jane's own literary career. Jane believed, mistakenly, that Jane was of Italian ancestry, and under the pseudonym \"Speranza\" (the Italian word for 'hope'), Jane wrote poetry for the revolutionary Young Irelanders in 1848; Jane was a lifelong Irish nationalist. Jane read the Young Irelanders' poetry to Oscar and Williehis brother, William (Willie) Wilde, inculcating a love of the Young Irelanders' poetry in Oscar and Willie. Jane's interest in the neo-classical revival showed in the paintings and busts of ancient Greece and Rome in Jane's home.Sir William Wilde was Ireland's's leading oto-ophthalmologic (ear and eye) surgeon and was knighted in 1864 for Sir William Wilde's services as medical adviser and assistant commissioner to the censuses of Ireland's. Sir William Wilde also wrote books about Irish archaeology and peasant folklore. Sir William Wilde, Sir William Wilde's dispensary for the care of Dublin's poor at the rear of Trinity College, Dublin (TCD), was the forerunner of the Dublin Eye and Ear Hospital, now located at Adelaide Road. On his father's's side [0] was descended from a Dutchman, Colonel de Wilde, who went to Ireland's with King William of Orange's invading army in 1690, and numerous Anglo-Irish ancestors. On [0]'s mother's side, [0]'s ancestors included a bricklayer from County Durham, who emigrated to Ireland's sometime in the 1770s.[0] was baptised as an infant in St. Mark's Church, Dublin, the local Church of Ireland (Anglican) church. When St. Mark's Church, Dublin, the local Church of Ireland (Anglican) church was closed, the records were moved to the nearby St. Ann's Church, Dawson Street. Davis Coakley mentions a second baptism by a Catholic priest, Father Prideaux Fox, who befriended Oscar's mother c. 1859. According to a Catholic priest, Father Prideaux Fox, who befriended Oscar's mother c. 1859's testimony in Donahoe's Magazine in 1905, Jane would visit a Catholic priest, Father Prideaux Fox, who befriended Oscar's mother c. 1859's chapel in Glencree, County Wicklow, for Mass, and would take Oscar and Willie with Jane. Jane asked a Catholic priest, Father Prideaux Fox, who befriended Oscar's mother c. 1859 in this period to baptise Oscar and Willie.a Catholic priest, Father Prideaux Fox, who befriended Oscar's mother c. 1859 described asked in this way:a Catholic priest, Father Prideaux Fox, who befriended Oscar's mother c. 1859 am not sure if Jane ever became a Catholic Jane but it was not long before Jane asked a Catholic priest, Father Prideaux Fox, who befriended Oscar's mother c. 1859 to instruct two of her children, one of two of her children being [0]. After a few weeks a Catholic priest, Father Prideaux Fox, who befriended Oscar's mother c. 1859 baptized two of her children, Jane being present on baptized. In addition to [0]'s two full siblings, [0] had three half-siblings, who were born out of wedlock before the marriage of his father's: Henry Wilson, born in 1838 to one woman, and Emily and Mary Wilde, born in 1847 and 1849, respectively, to a second woman. Sir William Wilde acknowledged paternity of his illegitimate or \"natural\" children and provided for his illegitimate or \"natural\" children's education, arranging for his illegitimate or \"natural\" children to be reared by Sir William Wilde's relatives rather than with Sir William Wilde's legitimate children in Sir William Wilde's family household with Sir William Wilde's .The family moved to No. 1 Merrion Square in 1855. With both Sir William and Lady Wilde's's success and delight in social life, No. 1 Merrion Square soon became the site of a \"unique medical and cultural milieu\". Guests at both Sir William and Lady Wilde's's salon included Sheridan Le Fanu, Charles Lever, George Petrie, Isaac Butt, William Rowan Hamilton and Samuel Ferguson.Wilde's sister, Isola Francesca Emily Wilde, was born on 2 April 1857. Wilde's sister, Isola Francesca Emily Wilde, was named in tribute to Iseult of Ireland, wife of Mark of Cornwall and lover of the Cornish knight, Sir Tristan. Wilde's sister, Isola Francesca Emily Wilde, shared the name Francesca with Wilde's sister, Isola Francesca Emily Wilde,'s , while Emily was the name of Wilde's sister, Isola Francesca Emily Wilde,'s maternal aunt. [0] would later describe how Wilde's sister, Isola Francesca Emily Wilde, was like \"a golden ray of sunshine dancing about The family's home\" and [0] was grief stricken when Wilde's sister, Isola Francesca Emily Wilde, died at the age of nine of a febrile illness. [0]'s poem \"Requiescat\" was written in Wilde's sister, Isola Francesca Emily Wilde,'s memory; the first stanza reads:\"Tread lightly, Wilde's sister, Isola Francesca Emily Wilde, is nearUnder the snowSpeak gently, Wilde's sister, Isola Francesca Emily Wilde, can hearthe daisies grow\"Until [0] was nine [0] was educated at home, where a French nursemaid and a German governess taught [0] a French nursemaid and a German governess's languages. [0] joined his brother, William (Willie) Wilde at Portora Royal School in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, which he attended from 1864 to 1871. At Portora Royal School in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, which he attended from 1864 to 1871, although [0] was not as popular as his brother, William (Willie) Wilde, [0] impressed [0]'s peers with the humorous and inventive school stories [0] told. Later in life [0] claimed that [0]'s fellow students had regarded [0] as a \"prodigy\" for [0]'s ability to speed read, claiming that [0] could read two facing pages simultaneously and consume a three-volume book in half an hour, retaining enough information to give a basic account of the plot. [0] excelled academically, particularly in the subject of Classics, in which [0] ranked fourth in Portora Royal School in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, which he attended from 1864 to 1871 in 1869. [0]'s aptitude for giving oral translations of Greek and Latin texts won [0] multiple prizes, including the Carpenter Prize for Greek Testament. [0] was one of only three students at Portora Royal School in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, which he attended from 1864 to 1871 to win a Royal School scholarship to Trinity in 1871.Until [0]'s early twenties, [0] summered at the villa, Moytura House, which his father's had built in Cong, County Mayo. There [0] and his brother, William (Willie) Wilde played with George Moore."}, "University education: 1870s": {"Trinity College, Dublin": "[0]  is our person to focus on. [0] left Portora with a royal scholarship to read classics at Trinity College, Dublin (TCD), from 1871 to 1874, sharing rooms with [0]'s older brother Willie Wilde. Trinity College, Dublin (TCD), placed [0] with scholars such as R. Y. Tyrell, Arthur Palmer, Edward Dowden and his tutor, Professor J. P. Mahaffy, who inspired his interest in Greek literature. As a student [0] worked with his tutor, Professor J. P. Mahaffy, who inspired his interest in Greek literature on his tutor, Professor J. P. Mahaffy, who inspired his interest in Greek literature's book Social Life in Greece. [0], despite later reservations, called his tutor, Professor J. P. Mahaffy, who inspired his interest in Greek literature \"[0]'s first and best teacher\" and \"the scholar who showed [0] how to love Greek things\". For his tutor, Professor J. P. Mahaffy, who inspired his interest in Greek literature's part, his tutor, Professor J. P. Mahaffy, who inspired his interest in Greek literature boasted of having created [0]; later, his tutor, Professor J. P. Mahaffy, who inspired his interest in Greek literature said [0] was \"the only blot on his tutor, Professor J. P. Mahaffy, who inspired his interest in Greek literature's tutorship\".The University Philosophical Society also provided an education, as members discussed intellectual and artistic subjects such as Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Algernon Charles Swinburne weekly. [0] quickly became an established member\u00a0\u2013 the members' suggestion book for 1874 contains two pages of banter (sportingly) mocking [0]'s emergent aestheticism.

At Trinity College, Dublin (TCD),, [0] established [0] as an outstanding student: [0] came first in [0]'s class in [0]'s first year, won a scholarship by competitive examination in [0]'s second and, in [0]'s finals, won the Berkeley Gold Medal in Greek, the University's highest academic award. [0] was encouraged to compete for a demyship (a half-scholarship worth \u00a395 (\u00a39,400 today) per year) to Magdalen College, Oxford\u00a0\u2013 which [0] won easily.", "Magdalen College, Oxford": "[0]  is our person to focus on. At Magdalen, [0] read Greats from 1874 to 1878, and from there [0] applied to join the Oxford Union, but failed to be elected.Attracted by the Oxford Union's dress, secrecy, and ritual, [0] petitioned the Apollo Masonic Lodge at Oxford, and was soon raised to the \"Sublime Degree of Master Mason\". During a resurgent interest in Freemasonry in [0]'s third year, [0] commented [0] \"would be awfully sorry to give Freemasonry up if [0] secede from the Protestant Heresy\". [0]'s active involvement in Freemasonry lasted only for the time [0] spent at Oxford; [0] allowed [0]'s membership of the Apollo Masonic Lodge at Oxford to lapse after failing to pay subscriptions.Catholicism deeply appealed to [0], especially Catholicism's rich liturgy, and [0] discussed converting to Catholicism with clergy several times. In 1877, [0] was left speechless after an audience with Pope Pius\u00a0IX in Rome. [0] eagerly read the books of Cardinal Newman, a noted Anglican priest who had converted to Catholicism and risen in the church hierarchy. [0] became more serious in 1878, when [0] met the Reverend Sebastian Bowden, a priest in the Brompton Oratory who had received some high-profile converts. Neither [0]'s father, who threatened to cut off [0]'s funds, nor Mahaffy thought much of the plan; but [0] balked at the last minute from pledging [0] to any formal creed, and on the appointed day of [0]'s baptism into Catholicism, sent the Reverend Sebastian Bowden, a priest in the Brompton Oratory who had received some high-profile converts a bunch of altar lilies instead. [0] did retain a lifelong interest in Catholic theology and liturgy.While at Magdalen, [0] became particularly well known for [0]'s role in the aesthetic and decadent movements. [0] wore [0]'s hair long, openly scorned \"manly\" sports though [0] occasionally boxed, and [0] decorated [0]'s rooms with peacock feathers, lilies, sunflowers, blue china and other objets d'art. [0] once remarked to friends, whom [0] entertained lavishly, \"[0] find it harder and harder every day to live up to [0]'s blue china.\" The line quickly became famous, accepted as a slogan by aesthetes but used against aesthetes by critics who sensed in it a terrible vacuousness. Some elements disdained the aesthetes, but the aesthetes's languishing attitudes and showy costumes became a recognised pose. [0] was once physically attacked by a group of four fellow students, and dealt with a group of four fellow students single-handedly, surprising critics. By his third year [0] had truly begun to develop [0] and [0]'s myth, and considered [0]'s learning to be more expansive than what was within the prescribed texts. considered resulted in [0]'s being rusticated for one term, after [0] had returned late to a college term from a trip to Greece with Mahaffy.[0] did not meet Walter Pater until his third year, but had been enthralled by his Studies in the History of the Renaissance, published during Wilde's final year in Trinity. Walter Pater argued that man's sensibility to beauty should be refined above all else, and that each moment should be felt to each moment's fullest extent. Years later, in De Profundis, [0] described his Studies in the History of the Renaissance, published during Wilde's final year in Trinity... as \"that book that has had such a strange influence over [0]'s life\". [0] learned tracts of his Studies in the History of the Renaissance, published during Wilde's final year in Trinity by heart, and carried his Studies in the History of the Renaissance, published during Wilde's final year in Trinity with [0] on travels in later years. Walter Pater gave [0] his sense of almost flippant devotion to art, though [0] gained a purpose for his sense of almost flippant devotion to art through the lectures and writings of critic John Ruskin. critic John Ruskin despaired at the self-validating aestheticism of Walter Pater, arguing that the importance of art lies in art's potential for the betterment of society. critic John Ruskin admired beauty, but believed beauty must be allied with, and applied to, moral good. When [0] eagerly attended critic John Ruskin's lecture series The Aesthetic and Mathematic Schools of Art in Florence, [0] learned about aesthetics as the non-mathematical elements of painting. Despite being given to neither early rising nor manual labour, [0] volunteered for critic John Ruskin's project to convert a swampy country lane into a smart road neatly edged with flowers.[0] won the 1878 Newdigate Prize for his poem \"Ravenna\", which reflected on his visit there in the previous year, and [0] duly read his poem \"Ravenna\", which reflected on his visit there in the previous year at Encaenia. In November 1878, [0] graduated with a double first in [0]'s B.A. of Classical Moderations and Literae Humaniores (Greats).

After graduation from Oxford, [0] returned to Dublin, where [0] met again Florence Balcombe, a childhood sweetheart. Florence Balcombe, a childhood sweetheart became engaged to Bram Stoker and they married in 1878. [0] was disappointed but stoic: [0] wrote to Florence Balcombe, a childhood sweetheart, remembering \"the two sweet years\u00a0\u2013 the sweetest years of all [0]'s youth\" during which they had been close. [0] also stated [0]'s intention to \"return to England, probably for good\". return [0] did in 1878, only briefly visiting Ireland twice after 1878.Unsure of [0]'s next step, [0] wrote to various acquaintances enquiring about Classics positions at Oxford or Cambridge.

Unusually, no prize was awarded 1879.With the last of [0]'s inheritance from the sale of [0]'s father's houses, [0] set [0] up as a bachelor in London. The 1881 British Census listed [0] as a boarder at 1 (now 44) Tite Street, Chelsea, where Frank Miles, a society painter, was the head of the household.Celebrated in London's high society, Lillie Langtry was introduced to [0] at Frank Miles, a society painter,'s studio in 1877. Lillie Langtry Lillie Langtry assumed great importance to [0] during [0]'s early years in London, and they remained close friends for many years; [0] tutored Lillie Langtry in Latin and later encouraged Lillie Langtry to pursue acting. Lillie Langtry wrote in Lillie Langtry's autobiography that [0] \"possessed a remarkably fascinating and compelling personality\", and \"the cleverness of his remarks received added value from [0]'s manner of delivering his remarks.[0] regularly attended the theatre and was especially taken with star actresses such as Ellen Terry and Sarah Bernhardt.

A one-off performance in London was advertised in November 1881 with Mrs. Bernard Beere as Vera, but withdrawn by [0] for what was claimed to be consideration for political feeling in England.[0] had been publishing lyrics and poems in magazines since entering Trinity College, especially in Kottabos and the Dublin University Magazine. In mid-1881, at 27 years old, [0] published Poems, which collected, revised and expanded his poems.Though Poems, which collected, revised and expanded his poems sold out Poems, which collected, revised and expanded his poems's first print run of 750 copies, Poems, which collected, revised and expanded his poems was not generally well received by the critics: Punch, for example, said that \"[0] is [0], but [0]'s poetry's tame\". By a tight vote, the Oxford Union condemned Poems, which collected, revised and expanded his poems for alleged plagiarism. The librarian, who had requested Poems, which collected, revised and expanded his poems for the library, returned the presentation copy to [0] with a note of apology. Biographer Richard Ellmann argues that [0]'s poem \"H\u00e9las!\" was a sincere, though flamboyant, attempt to explain the dichotomies [0] saw in [0]; one line reads: \"To drift with every passion till [0]'s soul / Is a stringed lute on which all winds can play\".Poems, which collected, revised and expanded his poems had further printings in 1882. Poems, which collected, revised and expanded his poems was bound in a rich, enamel parchment cover (embossed with gilt blossom) and printed on hand-made Dutch paper; over the next few years, [0] presented many copies to the dignitaries and writers who received [0] during [0]'s lecture tours.", "North America: 1882": "[0]  is our person to focus on. Aestheticism was sufficiently in vogue to be caricatured by Gilbert and Sullivan in Patience (1881). Richard D'Oyly Carte, an English impresario, invited [0] to make a lecture tour of North America, simultaneously priming the pump for a lecture tour of North America and selling [0] to the American public. [0] journeyed on the SS Arizona, arriving 2 January 1882, and disembarking the following day. Originally planned to last four months, a lecture tour of North America continued for almost a year owing to a lecture tour of North America's commercial success. [0] sought to transpose the beauty [0] saw in art into daily life. sought was a practical as well as philosophical project: in Oxford [0] had surrounded [0] with blue china and lilies, and now one of [0]'s lectures was on interior design. In a British Library article on aestheticism and decadence, Carolyn Burdett writes, \"[0] teased [0]'s readers with the claim that life imitates art rather than the other way round. [0]'s point was a serious one: we notice London fogs, [0] argued, because art and literature has taught us to do so. [0], among others, 'performed' these maxims.

[0] believed that the artist should hold forth higher ideals, and that pleasure and beauty would replace utilitarian ethics.[0] and aestheticism were both mercilessly caricatured and criticised in the press: the Springfield Republican, for instance, commented on [0]'s behaviour during [0]'s visit to Boston to lecture on aestheticism, suggesting that [0]'s conduct was more a bid for notoriety rather than devotion to beauty and the aesthetic. T. W. Higginson, a cleric and abolitionist, wrote in \"Unmanly Manhood\" of T. W. Higginson, a cleric and abolitionist,'s general concern that [0] [0] would improperly influence the behaviour of men and women.According to biographer Mich\u00e8le Mendelssohn, [0] was the subject of anti-Irish caricature and was portrayed as a monkey, a blackface performer and a Christy's Minstrel throughout [0]'s career. \"Harper's Weekly put a sunflower-worshipping monkey dressed as [0] on the front of the January 1882 issue.

In August [0] briefly returned to New York for the production of Vera, the rights of which he had sold to the American actress Marie Prescott. Vera, the rights of which he had sold to the American actress Marie Prescott was initially well received by the audience, but when the critics wrote lukewarm reviews, attendance fell sharply and Vera, the rights of which he had sold to the American actress Marie Prescott closed a week after Vera, the rights of which he had sold to the American actress Marie Prescott had opened.In London, [0] had been introduced in 1881 to Constance Lloyd, daughter of Horace Lloyd, a wealthy Queen's Counsel. Constance Lloyd, daughter of Horace Lloyd, a wealthy Queen's Counsel happened to be visiting Dublin in 1884, when [0] was lecturing at the Gaiety Theatre. [0] proposed to Constance Lloyd, daughter of Horace Lloyd, a wealthy Queen's Counsel, and they married on 29 May 1884 at the Anglican St James's Church, Paddington, in London. Although Constance Lloyd, daughter of Horace Lloyd, a wealthy Queen's Counsel had an annual allowance of \u00a3250, which was generous for a young woman (equivalent to \u00a327,700 in 2021), they had relatively luxurious tastes. they had preached to others for so long on the subject of design that people expected their home to set new standards. their home was duly renovated in seven months at considerable expense. they had two sons together, Cyril (1885) and Vyvyan (1886). [0] became the sole literary signatory of George Bernard Shaw's petition for a pardon of the anarchists arrested (and later executed) after the Haymarket massacre in Chicago in 1886. In 1886 at Oxford, [0] met Robert Ross. Robert Ross seemed unrestrained by the Victorian prohibition against homosexuality. By Richard Ellmann's account, Robert Ross was a precocious seventeen-year-old who \"so young and yet so knowing, was determined to seduce [0]\".

Like [0]'s parents before [0], [0] supported the cause of Irish nationalism and, when Charles Stewart Parnell was falsely accused of inciting murder, [0] wrote a series of astute columns defending Charles Stewart Parnell in the Daily Chronicle.[0]'s flair, having previously been put mainly into socialising, suited journalism and rapidly attracted notice. With [0]'s youth nearly over, and a family to support, in mid-1887 [0] became the editor of The Lady's World magazine, [0]'s name prominently appearing on the cover. [0] promptly renamed The Lady's World magazine as The Woman's World and raised The Lady's World magazine's tone, adding serious articles on parenting, culture, and politics, while keeping discussions of fashion and arts. Two pieces of fiction were usually included, one to be read to children, the other for the women themselves. [0] worked hard to solicit good contributions from [0]'s wide artistic acquaintance, including those of Wilde's wife and [0]'s wife Constance, while his own \"Literary and Other Notes\" were his own \"Literary and Other Notes\" popular and amusing.The initial vigour and excitement which [0] brought to the editor of The Lady's World magazine began to fade as administration, commuting and office life became tedious. At the same time as [0]'s interest flagged, the publishers became concerned anew about circulation: sales, at the relatively high price of one shilling, remained low. Increasingly sending instructions to The Lady's World magazine by letter, [0] began a new period of creative work and [0]'s own column appeared less regularly. In October 1889, [0] had finally found [0]'s voice in prose and, at the end of the second volume, [0] left The Lady's World magazine. The Lady's World magazine outlasted [0] by only one year.If Wilde's period at the helm of the magazine was a mixed success from an organizational point of view, Wilde's period at the helm of the magazine played a pivotal role in [0]'s development as a writer and facilitated [0]'s ascent to fame. Whilst [0] supplied articles under the guidance of [0]'s editors, [0] was forced to learn to manipulate the literary marketplace on [0]'s own terms.During the 1880s, [0] was a close friend of the artist James McNeill Whistler and they dined together on many occasions. At one of these dinners, the artist James McNeill Whistler said a bon mot that Wilde found particularly witty, [0] exclaimed that [0] wished that [0] had said a bon mot that Wilde found particularly witty, and the artist James McNeill Whistler retorted \"[0] will, [0], [0] will.\" Herbert Vivian\u2014a mutual friend of Wilde and Whistler\u2014attended one of these dinners and recorded one of these dinners in his article The Reminiscences of a Short Life, which appeared in The Sun in 1889. his article The Reminiscences of a Short Life, which appeared in The Sun in 1889 alleged that [0] had a habit of passing off other people's witticisms as [0]'s own\u2014especially Whistler's. [0] considered his article The Reminiscences of a Short Life, which appeared in The Sun in 1889 to be a scurrilous betrayal, and his article The Reminiscences of a Short Life, which appeared in The Sun in 1889 directly caused the broken friendship between [0] the artist James McNeill Whistler. his article The Reminiscences of a Short Life, which appeared in The Sun in 1889 also caused great acrimony between [0] and Herbert Vivian\u2014a mutual friend of Wilde and Whistler\u2014, [0] accusing Herbert Vivian\u2014a mutual friend of Wilde and Whistler\u2014 of \"the inaccuracy of an eavesdropper with the method of a blackmailer\" and banishing Herbert Vivian\u2014a mutual friend of Wilde and Whistler\u2014 from [0]'s circle. Herbert Vivian\u2014a mutual friend of Wilde and Whistler\u2014's allegations did not diminish [0]'s reputation as an epigrammatist. London theatre director Luther Munday recounted some of [0]'s typical quips: London theatre director Luther Munday said of the artist James McNeill Whistler that \"the artist James McNeill Whistler had no enemies, but was intensely disliked by the artist James McNeill Whistler's friends.\" Of Hall Caine that \"the artist James McNeill Whistler wrote at the top of the artist James McNeill Whistler's voice.\" Of Rudyard Kipling that \"the artist James McNeill Whistler revealed life by splendid flashes of vulgarity.\" Of Henry James that \"the artist James McNeill Whistler wrote fiction as if fiction were a painful duty,\" and of Marion Crawford that \"the artist James McNeill Whistler immolated the artist James McNeill Whistler on the altar of local colour.\"", "Shorter fiction": "[0]  is our person to focus on. [0] published The Happy Prince and Other Tales in 1888, and had been regularly writing fairy stories for magazines. In 1891 [0] published two more collections, Lord Arthur Savile's Crime and Other Stories, and in September A House of Pomegranates was dedicated \"To [0]\". \"The Portrait of Mr. W. H.\", which Wilde had begun in 1887, was first published in Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine in July 1889. \"The Portrait of Mr. W. H.\", which Wilde had begun in 1887 is a short story, which reports a conversation, in which the theory that Shakespeare's sonnets were written out of the poet's love of the boy actor \"Willie Hughes\", is advanced, retracted, and then propounded again. The only evidence for the theory that Shakespeare's sonnets were written out of the poet's love of the boy actor \"Willie Hughes\" is two supposed puns within Shakespeare's sonnets.The anonymous narrator is at first sceptical, then believing, finally flirtatious with the reader: The anonymous narrator concludes that \"there is really a great deal to be said of the theory that Shakespeare's sonnets were written out of the poet's love of the boy actor \"Willie Hughes\".\" By the end fact and fiction have melded together. Arthur Ransome wrote that [0] \"read something of [0] into Shakespeare's sonnets\" and became fascinated with the theory that Shakespeare's sonnets were written out of the poet's love of the boy actor \"Willie Hughes\" despite the lack of biographical evidence for the boy actor \"Willie Hughes\"'s existence. Instead of writing a short but serious essay on the question, [0] tossed the theory that Shakespeare's sonnets were written out of the poet's love of the boy actor \"Willie Hughes\" amongst the three characters of \"The Portrait of Mr. W. H.\", which Wilde had begun in 1887, allowing the theory that Shakespeare's sonnets were written out of the poet's love of the boy actor \"Willie Hughes\" to unfold as background to the plot. \"The Portrait of Mr. W. H.\", which Wilde had begun in 1887 thus is an early masterpiece of [0]'s combining many elements that interested [0]: conversation, literature and the idea that to shed oneself of an idea one must first convince another of an idea's truth. Arthur Ransome concludes that [0] succeeds precisely because the literary criticism is unveiled with such a deft touch.Though containing nothing but \"special pleading\", it would not, Arthur Ransome says \"be possible to build an airier castle in Spain than this of the boy actor \"Willie Hughes\"\" we continue listening nonetheless to be charmed by the telling. \"You must believe in the boy actor \"Willie Hughes\",\" [0] told an acquaintance, \"[0] almost do, [0].\"", "Essays and dialogues ": "[0]  is our person to focus on. [0], having tired of journalism, had been busy setting out [0]'s aesthetic ideas more fully in a series of longer prose pieces which were published in the major literary-intellectual journals of the day. In January 1889, The Decay of Lying: A Dialogue appeared in The Nineteenth Century, and Pen, Pencil and Poison, a satirical biography of Thomas Griffiths Wainewright, in The Fortnightly Review, edited by [0]'s friend Frank Harris. Two of [0]'s four writings on aesthetics are dialogues: though [0] had evolved professionally from lecturer to writer, [0] retained an oral tradition of sorts. Having always excelled as a wit and raconteur, [0] often composed by assembling phrases, bons mots and witticisms into a longer, cohesive work.[0] was concerned about the effect of moralising on art; [0] believed in art's redemptive, developmental powers: \"Art is individualism, and individualism is a disturbing and disintegrating force. There lies individualism's immense value. For what individualism seeks is to disturb monotony of type, slavery of custom, tyranny of habit, and the reduction of man to the level of a machine.\" In [0]'s only political text, The Soul of Man Under Socialism, [0] argued political conditions should establish this primacy \u2013 private property should be abolished, and cooperation should be substituted for competition. [0] wrote \"Socialism, Communism, or whatever one chooses to call itSocialism, Communism, or whatever one chooses to call it, by converting private property into public wealth, and substituting co-operation for competition, will restore society to society's proper condition of a thoroughly healthy organism, and insure the material well-being of each member of the community. Socialism, Communism, or whatever one chooses to call it will, in fact, give Life Life's proper basis and Life's proper environment\". At the same time, [0] stressed that the government most amenable to artists was no government at all. [0] envisioned a society where mechanisation has freed human effort from the burden of necessity, effort which can instead be expended on artistic creation. George Orwell summarised, \"In effect, the world will be populated by artists, each striving after perfection in the way that seems best to each.\"This point of view did not align [0] with the Fabians, intellectual socialists who advocated using state apparatus to change social conditions, nor did \"This point of view endear [0] to the monied classes whom [0] had previously entertained. Hesketh Pearson, introducing a collection of [0]'s essays in 1950, remarked how The Soul of Man Under Socialism had been an inspirational text for revolutionaries in Tsarist Russia but laments that in the Stalinist era \"it is doubtful whether there are any uninspected places in which The Soul of Man Under Socialism could now be hidden\".Man is least Man when Man talks in Man's own person. Give Man a mask, and Man will tell you the truth.\u2014From \"The Critic as Artist\" published in Intentions (1891)Wilde considered including \"The Critic as Artist\" published in Intentions (1891)Wilde and \"The Portrait of Mr. W. H.\", [0]'s essay-story on Shakespeare's sonnets, in a new anthology in 1891, but eventually decided to limit a new anthology to purely aesthetic subjects. Intentions packaged revisions of four essays: The Decay of Lying; Pen, Pencil and Poison; The Truth of Masks (first published 1885); and The Critic as Artist in two parts. For Hesketh Pearson, the essays and dialogues exhibit every aspect of [0]'s genius and character: wit, romancer, talker, lecturer, humanist and scholar and concludes that \"no other productions of [0]'s have as varied an appeal\". 1891 turned out to be [0]'s annus mirabilis; apart from [0]'s three collections [0] also produced [0]'s only novel.", "The Picture of Dorian Gray": "Oscar Wilde  is our person to focus on. [0] was published as the lead story in the July 1890 edition of Lippincott's Monthly Magazine, along with five others. [0] begins with a man painting The Picture of Dorian Gray. When Dorian Gray sees The Picture of Dorian Gray, Dorian Gray breaks down. Distraught that Dorian Gray's beauty will fade while The Picture of Dorian Gray stays beautiful, Dorian Gray inadvertently makes a Faustian bargain in which The Picture of Dorian Gray grows old while Dorian Gray stays beautiful and young. For Oscar Wilde, the purpose of art would be to guide life as if beauty alone were life's object. As The Picture of Dorian Gray allows Dorian Gray to escape the corporeal ravages of Dorian Gray's hedonism, Oscar Wilde sought to juxtapose the beauty Oscar Wilde saw in art with daily life.Reviewers immediately criticised the novel's's decadence and homosexual allusions; The Daily Chronicle for example, called the novel's \"unclean\", \"poisonous\", and \"heavy with the mephitic odours of moral and spiritual putrefaction\". Oscar Wilde vigorously responded, writing to the editor of the Scots Observer, in which Oscar Wilde clarified Oscar Wilde's stance on ethics and aesthetics in art \u2013 \"If a work of art is rich and vital and complete, those who have artistic instincts will see a work of art's beauty and those to whom ethics appeal more strongly will see a work of art's moral lesson.\" Oscar Wilde nevertheless revised the novel's extensively for book publication in 1891: six new chapters were added, some overtly decadent passages and homo-eroticism excised, and a preface was included consisting of twenty-two epigrams, such as \"Books are well written, or badly written. That is all.\"Contemporary reviewers and modern critics have postulated numerous possible sources of [0], a search Jershua McCormack argues is futile because Oscar Wilde \"has tapped a root of Western folklore so deep and ubiquitous that [0] has escaped [0]'s origins and returned to the oral tradition\". Oscar Wilde claimed the plot was \"an idea that is as old as the history of literature but to which Oscar Wilde have given a new form\". Modern critic Robin McKie considered the novel's to be technically mediocre, saying that the conceit of the plot had guaranteed the plot's fame, but the device is never pushed to the device's full. On the other hand, Robert McCrum of The Guardian lists the novel's among the 100 best novels ever written in English, calling the novel's \"an arresting, and slightly camp, exercise in late-Victorian gothic\". the novel's has been the subject of many adaptations to film and stage, and one of the novel's's most quoted lines, \"there is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and only one thing in the world worse than being talked about is not being talked about\", features in Monty Python's's \"Oscar Wilde sketch\" in an episode of Monty Python's's Flying Circus.", "": ""}, "Theatrical career: 1892\u20131895": {"Salom\u00e9": "[0]  is our person to focus on. The 1891 census records the Wildes' residence at 16 Tite Street, where [0] lived with [0]'s wife Constance and two sons. Not content with being better known than ever in London, though, [0] returned to Paris in October 1891, this time as a respected writer. [0] was received at the salons litt\u00e9raires, including the famous mardis of St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9, a renowned symbolist poet of the time. [0]'s two plays during the 1880s, Vera; or, The Nihilists and The Duchess of Padua, had not met with much success. [0] had continued [0]'s interest in the theatre and now, after finding [0]'s voice in prose, [0]'s thoughts turned again to the dramatic form as the biblical iconography of Salome filled [0]'s mind. One evening, after discussing depictions of Salome throughout history, [0] returned to [0]'s hotel and noticed a blank copybook lying on the desk, and it occurred to [0] to write in a blank copybook what [0] had been saying. The result was a new play, Salom\u00e9, written rapidly and in French.A tragedy, a new play, Salom\u00e9, written rapidly and in French tells the story of Salome, the stepdaughter of the tetrarch Herod Antipas, who, to the tetrarch Herod Antipas's dismay but mother's delight, requests the head of Jokanaan (John the Baptist) on a silver platter as a reward for dancing the Dance of the Seven Veils. When [0] returned to London just before Christmas the Paris Echo referred to [0] as \"le great event\" of the season. Rehearsals of the play, starring Sarah Bernhardt, began but a new play, Salom\u00e9, written rapidly and in French was refused a licence by the Lord Chamberlain, since a new play, Salom\u00e9, written rapidly and in French depicted biblical characters. a new play, Salom\u00e9, written rapidly and in French was published jointly in Paris and London in 1893, but was not performed until 1896 in Paris, during [0]'s later incarceration.", "Comedies of society": "[0]  is our person to focus on. Wilde, who had first set out to irritate Victorian society with [0]'s dress and talking points, then to outrage Victorian society with Dorian Gray, [0]'s novel of vice hidden beneath art, finally found a way to critique society on society's own terms. Lady Windermere's Fan was first performed on 20 February 1892 at St James's Theatre, packed with the cream of society. On the surface a witty comedy, there is subtle subversion underneath: \"Lady Windermere's Fan concludes with collusive concealment rather than collective disclosure\". The audience, like Lady Windermere, are forced to soften harsh social codes in favour of a more nuanced view. Lady Windermere's Fan was enormously popular, touring the country for months, but largely trashed by conservative critics. The success of Lady Windermere's Fan saw [0] earn \u00a37,000 in the first year alone (worth \u00a3809,900 as of June 2022).His first hit play was followed by A Woman of No Importance in 1893, another Victorian comedy, revolving around the spectre of illegitimate births, mistaken identities and late revelations. [0] was commissioned to write two more plays and An Ideal Husband, written in 1894, followed in January 1895.Peter Raby said two more plays were well-pitched: \"[0], with one eye on the dramatic genius of Ibsen, and the other on the commercial competition in London's West End, targeted [0]'s audience with adroit precision\".", "Queensberry family": "[0]  is our person to focus on. In mid-1891 Lionel Johnson introduced [0] to Lord Alfred Douglas, Johnson's cousin, who was at the time an undergraduate at Oxford. Known to Lord Alfred Douglas, Johnson's cousin, who was at the time an undergraduate at Oxford's family and friends as \"Bosie\", Lord Alfred Douglas, Johnson's cousin, who was at the time an undergraduate at Oxford was a handsome and spoilt young man. An intimate friendship sprang up between Wilde and Douglas Lord Alfred Douglas, Johnson's cousin, who was at the time an undergraduate at Oxford and by 1893 [0] was infatuated with Lord Alfred Douglas, Johnson's cousin, who was at the time an undergraduate at Oxford and Wilde and Douglas consorted together regularly in a tempestuous affair. If [0] was relatively indiscreet, even flamboyant, in the way [0] acted, Lord Alfred Douglas, Johnson's cousin, who was at the time an undergraduate at Oxford was reckless in public. Wilde, who was earning up to \u00a3100 a week from [0]'s plays ([0]'s salary at The Woman's World had been \u00a36), indulged Lord Alfred Douglas, Johnson's cousin, who was at the time an undergraduate at Oxford's every whim: material, artistic, or sexual.Lord Alfred Douglas, Johnson's cousin, who was at the time an undergraduate at Oxford soon initiated [0] into the Victorian underground of gay prostitution, and [0] was introduced to a series of young working-class male prostitutes (rent boys) from 1892 onwards by Alfred Taylor. These infrequent rendezvous usually took the same form: [0] would meet the boy, offer the boy gifts, dine the boy privately and then take the boy to a hotel room. Unlike [0]'s idealised relations with Ross, John Gray, and Lord Alfred Douglas, Johnson's cousin, who was at the time an undergraduate at Oxford, all of whom remained part of [0]'s aesthetic circle, a series of young working-class male prostitutes (rent boys) were uneducated and knew nothing of literature. Soon [0]'s public and private lives had become sharply divided; in De Profundis [0] wrote to Lord Alfred Douglas, Johnson's cousin, who was at the time an undergraduate at Oxford that \"It was like feasting with panthers; the danger was half the excitement... [0] did not know that when panthers were to strike at [0] strike was to be at another's piping and at another's pay.Lord Alfred Douglas, Johnson's cousin, who was at the time an undergraduate at Oxford and some Oxford friends founded a journal, The Chameleon, to which Wilde \"sent a page of paradoxes originally destined for the Saturday Review\". \"Phrases and Philosophies for the Use of the Young\" was to come under attack six months later at [0]'s trial, where [0] was forced to defend a journal, The Chameleon, to which Wilde \"sent a page of paradoxes originally destined for the Saturday Review. In any case, a journal, The Chameleon, to which Wilde \"sent a page of paradoxes originally destined for the Saturday Review became unique: a journal, The Chameleon, to which Wilde \"sent a page of paradoxes originally destined for the Saturday Review was not published again.Lord Alfred Douglas, Johnson's cousin, who was at the time an undergraduate at Oxford's was known for Lord Alfred's father, the Marquess of Queensberry's outspoken atheism, brutish manner and creation of the modern rules of boxing. Queensberry, who feuded regularly with Lord Alfred's father, the Marquess of Queensberry's , confronted Wilde and Lord Alfred Lord Alfred's father, the Marquess of Queensberry, about the nature of Wilde and Lord Alfred's relationship several times, but [0] was able to mollify Lord Alfred's father, the Marquess of Queensberry. In June 1894, Lord Alfred's father, the Marquess of Queensberry called on [0] at 16 Tite Street, without an appointment, and clarified Lord Alfred's father, the Marquess of Queensberry's stance: \"Lord Alfred's father, the Marquess of Queensberry do not say that [0] are it, but [0] look it, and pose at it, which is just as bad. And if Lord Alfred's father, the Marquess of Queensberry catch [0] and Lord Alfred's father, the Marquess of Queensberry's again in any public restaurant Lord Alfred's father, the Marquess of Queensberry will thrash [0]\" to which [0] responded: \"[0] don't know what the Queensberry rules are, but the [0] rule is to shoot on sight\". [0]'s account in De Profundis was less triumphant: \"It was when, in [0]'s library at Tite Street, waving Lord Alfred's father, the Marquess of Queensberry's small hands in the air in epileptic fury, Lord Alfred's father, the Marquess of Queensberry... stood uttering every foul word Lord Alfred's father, the Marquess of Queensberry's foul mind could think of, and screaming the loathsome threats Lord Alfred's father, the Marquess of Queensberry afterwards with such cunning carried out\". Lord Alfred's father, the Marquess of Queensberry only described the scene once, saying [0] had \"shown Lord Alfred's father, the Marquess of Queensberry the white feather\", meaning [0] had acted in a cowardly way. Though trying to remain calm, [0] saw that [0] was becoming ensnared in a brutal family quarrel. [0] did not wish to bear Lord Alfred's father, the Marquess of Queensberry's insults, but [0] knew to confront Lord Alfred's father, the Marquess of Queensberry could lead to disaster were [0]'s liaisons disclosed publicly.", "The Importance of Being Earnest": "[0]  is our person to focus on. Wilde's final play again returns to the theme of switched identities: the play's two protagonists engage in \"bunburying\" (the maintenance of alternative personas in the town and country) which allows the play's two protagonists to escape Victorian social mores. Wilde's final play is even lighter in tone than [0]'s earlier comedies. While their characters often rise to serious themes in moments of crisis, Wilde's final play lacks the by-now-stock Wildean characters: there is no \"woman with a past\", the principals are neither villainous nor cunning, simply idle cultiv\u00e9s, and the idealistic young women are not that innocent. Mostly set in drawing rooms and almost completely lacking in action or violence, Wilde's final play lacks the self-conscious decadence found in The Picture of Dorian Gray and Salome.Wilde's final play was rapidly written in [0]'s artistic maturity in late 1894. Wilde's final play was first performed on 14 February 1895, at St James's Theatre in London, [0]'s second collaboration with George Alexander, the actor-manager. Both author and George Alexander, the actor-manager assiduously revised, prepared and rehearsed every line, scene and setting in the months before the premiere, creating a carefully constructed representation of late-Victorian society, yet simultaneously mocking late-Victorian society. During rehearsal George Alexander, the actor-manager requested that [0] shorten Wilde's final play from four acts to three, which [0] did. Premieres at St James's Theatre in London's seemed like \"brilliant parties\", and the premiere The Importance of Being Earnest was no exception. Allan Aynesworth (who played Algernon) recalled to Hesketh Pearson, \"In Allan Aynesworth (who played Algernon)'s fifty-three years of acting, Allan Aynesworth (who played Algernon) never remember a greater triumph than [that] first night.\" Wilde's final play's immediate reception as [0]'s best work to date finally crystallised [0]'s fame into a solid artistic reputation. In a review of Wilde's final play for The Pall Mall Gazette H. G. Wells wrote, \"More humorous dealing with theatrical conventions it would be difficult to imagine. [0] has decorated a humour that is Gilbertian with innumerable spangles of that wit that is all [0]'s own\". The Importance of Being Earnest remains [0]'s most popular play.[0]'s professional success was mirrored by an escalation in [0]'s feud with Queensberry. Queensberry had planned to insult [0] publicly by throwing a bouquet of rotting vegetables onto the stage; [0] was tipped off and had Queensberry barred from entering St James's Theatre in London. Fifteen weeks later [0] was in prison.", "": ""}, "Trials": {"Wilde v Queensberry": "Oscar Wilde  is our person to focus on. On 18 February 1895, [0] left [0]'s at Oscar Wilde's club, the Albemarle, inscribed: \"For Oscar Wilde\". Oscar Wilde, encouraged by Douglas and against the advice of Oscar Wilde's friends, initiated a private prosecution against Queensberry for libel, since his calling card amounted to a public accusation that Wilde had committed the crime of sodomy.[0] was arrested for criminal libel, a charge carrying a possible sentence of up to two years in prison. Under the 1843 Libel Act, [0] could avoid conviction for libel only by demonstrating that a public accusation that Wilde had committed the crime of sodomy was in fact true, and furthermore that there was some \"public benefit\" to having made a public accusation that Wilde had committed the crime of sodomy openly. [0]'s lawyers thus hired private detectives to find evidence of Oscar Wilde's homosexual liaisons.Oscar Wilde's friends had advised Oscar Wilde against a private prosecution against Queensberry for libel at a Saturday Review meeting at the Caf\u00e9 Royal on 24 March 1895; Frank Harris warned Oscar Wilde that \"they are going to prove sodomy against Oscar Wilde\" and advised Oscar Wilde to flee to France. Oscar Wilde and Douglas walked out in a huff, Oscar Wilde saying \"it is at such moments as these that one sees who are one's true friends\". The scene was witnessed by George Bernard Shaw who recalled The scene to Arthur Ransome a day or so before Oscar Wilde's trial for libelling Douglas in 1913. To Arthur Ransome The scene confirmed what Arthur Ransome had said in Arthur Ransome's 1912 book on Oscar Wilde: that Douglas's rivalry for Oscar Wilde with Robbie Ross and Douglas's arguments with Douglas's father had resulted in Oscar Wilde's public disaster, as Oscar Wilde wrote in De Profundis. Douglas lost Douglas's case. Shaw included an account of The scene Frank Harrisin the preface to Shaw's play The Dark Lady of the Sonnets.a private prosecution against Queensberry for libel became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre as salacious details of Oscar Wilde's private life with Taylor and Douglas began to appear in the press. A team of private detectives had directed [0]'s lawyers, led by Edward Carson QC, to the world of the Victorian underground. Oscar Wilde's association with blackmailers and male prostitutes, cross-dressers and homosexual brothels was recorded, and various persons involved were interviewed, some being coerced to appear as witnesses since some too were accomplices to the crimes of which Oscar Wilde was accused.a private prosecution against Queensberry for libel opened at the Old Bailey in central London on 3 April 1895 before Justice Richard Henn Collins, a fellow Dubliner, amid scenes of near hysteria both in the press and the public galleries. The extent of the evidence massed against Oscar Wilde forced Oscar Wilde to declare meekly, \"Oscar Wilde am the prosecutor in this case\". Wilde's lawyer, Sir Edward Clarke, opened this case by pre-emptively asking Oscar Wilde about two suggestive letters Wilde had written to Douglas, which the defence had in its possession. Wilde's lawyer, Sir Edward Clarke, characterised the first as a \"prose sonnet\" and admitted that the \"poetical language\" might seem strange to the court but claimed the \"poetical language\"'s intent was innocent. Oscar Wilde stated that two suggestive letters Wilde had written to Douglas, which the defence had in its possession had been obtained by blackmailers who had attempted to extort money from him, but Oscar Wilde had refused, suggesting blackmailers who had attempted to extort money from him should take the \u00a360 (equal to \u00a37,400 today) offered, \"unusual for a prose piece of that length\". Oscar Wilde claimed to regard two suggestive letters Wilde had written to Douglas, which the defence had in its possession as works of art rather than something of which to be ashamed.Carson, who was also a Dubliner who had attended Trinity College, Dublin, at the same time as Wilde, cross-examined Oscar Wilde on how Oscar Wilde perceived the moral content of Oscar Wilde's works. Oscar Wilde replied with characteristic wit and flippancy, claiming that works of art are not capable of being moral or immoral but only well or poorly made, and that only \"brutes and illiterates\", whose views on art \"are incalculably stupid\", would make such judgements about art. Carson, who was also a Dubliner who had attended Trinity College, Dublin, at the same time as Wilde, diverged from the normal practice of asking closed questions. Carson, who was also a Dubliner who had attended Trinity College, Dublin, at the same time as Wilde, pressed Oscar Wilde on each topic from every angle, squeezing out nuances of meaning from Wilde's answers, removing Wilde's answers from Wilde's answers's aesthetic context and portraying Oscar Wilde as evasive and decadent. While Oscar Wilde won the most laughs from the court, Carson, who was also a Dubliner who had attended Trinity College, Dublin, at the same time as Wilde, scored the most legal points. To undermine Oscar Wilde's credibility, and to justify [0]'s description of Oscar Wilde as a \"posing somdomite\", Carson, who was also a Dubliner who had attended Trinity College, Dublin, at the same time as Wilde, drew from Douglas an admission of Oscar Wilde's capacity for \"posing\", by demonstrating that Oscar Wilde had lied about Oscar Wilde's age under oath. Playing on lied, Carson, who was also a Dubliner who had attended Trinity College, Dublin, at the same time as Wilde, returned to the topic throughout Carson, who was also a Dubliner who had attended Trinity College, Dublin, at the same time as Wilde,'s cross-examination. Carson, who was also a Dubliner who had attended Trinity College, Dublin, at the same time as Wilde, also tried to justify [0]'s characterisation by quoting from Oscar Wilde's novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray, referring in particular to a scene in the second chapter, in which Lord Henry Wotton explains Lord Henry Wotton's decadent philosophy to Dorian, an \"innocent young man\", in Carson, who was also a Dubliner who had attended Trinity College, Dublin, at the same time as Wilde,'s words.Carson, who was also a Dubliner who had attended Trinity College, Dublin, at the same time as Wilde, then moved to the factual evidence and questioned Oscar Wilde about his friendships with younger, lower-class men. Oscar Wilde admitted being on a first-name basis and lavishing gifts upon younger, lower-class men, but insisted that nothing untoward had occurred and that younger, lower-class men were merely good friends of Oscar Wilde's. Carson, who was also a Dubliner who had attended Trinity College, Dublin, at the same time as Wilde, repeatedly pointed out the unusual nature of his friendships with younger, lower-class men and insinuated that younger, lower-class men were prostitutes. Oscar Wilde replied that Oscar Wilde did not believe in social barriers, and simply enjoyed the society of young men. Then Carson, who was also a Dubliner who had attended Trinity College, Dublin, at the same time as Wilde, asked Oscar Wilde directly whether Oscar Wilde had ever kissed a certain servant boy, Oscar Wilde responded, \"Oh, dear no. a certain servant boy was a particularly plain boy\u00a0\u2013 unfortunately ugly\u00a0\u2013 Oscar Wilde pitied a certain servant boy for it.\" Carson, who was also a Dubliner who had attended Trinity College, Dublin, at the same time as Wilde, pressed Oscar Wilde on the answer, repeatedly asking why a certain servant boy's ugliness was relevant. Oscar Wilde hesitated, then for the first time became flustered: \"Carson, who was also a Dubliner who had attended Trinity College, Dublin, at the same time as Wilde, sting Oscar Wilde and insult Oscar Wilde and try to unnerve Oscar Wilde; and at times one says things flippantly when one ought to speak more seriously.\"In Carson, who was also a Dubliner who had attended Trinity College, Dublin, at the same time as Wilde,'s opening speech for a private prosecution against Queensberry for libel, Carson, who was also a Dubliner who had attended Trinity College, Dublin, at the same time as Wilde, announced that Carson, who was also a Dubliner who had attended Trinity College, Dublin, at the same time as Wilde, had located several male prostitutes who were to testify that they had had sex with Wildeseveral male prostitutes who were to testify that they had had sex with Wilde . On the advice of Oscar Wilde's lawyers, Oscar Wilde dropped a private prosecution against Queensberry for libel. [0] was found not guilty, as the court declared that a public accusation that Wilde had committed the crime of sodomy was justified, \"true in substance and in fact\". Under the Libel Act 1843, [0]'s acquittal rendered Oscar Wilde legally liable for the considerable expenses [0] had incurred in Oscar Wilde's defence, which left Oscar Wilde bankrupt.", "Regina v Wilde": "[0]  is our person to focus on. After [0] left the court, a warrant for [0]'s arrest was applied for on charges of sodomy and gross indecency. Robbie Ross found [0] at the Cadogan Hotel, Pont Street, Knightsbridge, with Reginald Turner. Both men advised [0] to go at once to Dover and try to get a boat to France; [0]'s mother advised [0] to stay and fight. [0], lapsing into inaction, could only say, \"The train has gone. It's too late.\" On 6 April 1895, [0] was arrested for \"gross indecency\" under Section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885, a term meaning homosexual acts not amounting to buggery (an offence under a separate statute). At [0]'s instruction, Ross and Wilde's butler forced Ross and Wilde's butler's way into the bedroom and library of 16 Tite Street, packing some personal effects, manuscripts, and letters. [0] was then imprisoned on remand at Holloway, where he received daily visits from Douglas.Events moved quickly and his prosecution opened on 26 April 1895, before Mr Justice Charles. [0] pleaded not guilty. [0] had already begged Douglas to leave London for Paris, but Douglas complained bitterly, even wanting to give evidence; Douglas was pressed to go and soon fled to the Hotel du Monde. Fearing persecution, Robbie Ross and many others also left the United Kingdom during this time. Under cross-examination [0] was at first hesitant, then spoke eloquently:Charles Gill (prosecuting): What is \"the love that dare not speak its name\"?Wildethe love that dare not speak its name\"?Wilde's : \"The love that dare not speak the love that dare not speak its name\"?Wilde's name\" in this century is such a great affection of an elder for a younger man as there was between David and Jonathan, such as Plato made the very basis of Plato's philosophy, and such as you find in the sonnets of Michelangelo and Shakespeare. It is that deep spiritual affection that is as pure as that deep spiritual affection is perfect. that deep spiritual affection dictates and pervades great works of art, like those of Shakespeare and Michelangelo, and those two letters of mine, such as those two letters of mine are. that deep spiritual affection is in this century misunderstood, so much misunderstood that that deep spiritual affection may be described as \"the love that dare not speak its namethe love that dare not speak its name's \", and on that account of it [0] am placed where [0] am now. that deep spiritual affection is beautiful, that deep spiritual affection is fine, that deep spiritual affection is the noblest form of affection. There is nothing unnatural about that deep spiritual affection. that deep spiritual affection is intellectual, and that deep spiritual affection repeatedly exists between an older and a younger man, when an older has intellect, and a younger man has all the joy, hope and glamour of life before a younger man. That that deep spiritual affection should be so, the world does not understand. the world mocks at that deep spiritual affection, and sometimes puts one in the pillory for that deep spiritual affection. This response was counter-productive in a legal sense, for This response only served to reinforce the charges of homosexual behaviour. his prosecution ended with the jury unable to reach a verdict. [0]'s counsel, Sir Edward Clarke, was finally able to get a magistrate to allow Wilde and his friends to post bail. The Reverend Stewart Headlam put up most of the \u00a35,000 surety required by the court, having disagreed with [0]'s treatment by the press and the courts. [0] was freed from Holloway, where he received daily visits from Douglas and, shunning attention, went into hiding at the house of Ernest and Ada Leverson, two of [0]'s firm friends. Edward Carson approached Sir Frank Lockwood QC, the Solicitor General, and asked \"Can we not let up on [0] now?\" Sir Frank Lockwood QC, the Solicitor General answered that Sir Frank Lockwood QC, the Solicitor General would like to do so, but feared that the case had become too politicised to be dropped.The final trial was presided over by Mr Justice Charles. On 25 May 1895, Wilde and his friends were convicted of gross indecency and sentenced to two years' hard labour. Mr Justice Charles described two years' hard labour as \"totally inadequate for a case such as the case\", and that the case was \"the worst case Mr Justice Charles have ever tried\". [0]'s response \"And [0]? May [0] say nothing, Mr Justice Charles?\" was drowned out in cries of \"Shame\" in the courtroom.Although it is widely believed that the charges of homosexual behaviour were related to [0]'s consensual activities, The Trials of [0], which includes an original transcript of the libel trial (which came to light in 2000), suggests that [0] took advantage of teenagers. Antony Edmonds feels that [0] would have faced prosecution today: \"For example, [0] certainly paid for sex with youths under the age of 18 which is a criminal offence. But even if [0]'s activities had led only to exposure and not to arrest, [0] would have been savagely pilloried in the media. [0] was 39 when [0] seduced Alphonse Conway, and Alphonse Conway was an inexperienced boy of 16\". However, [0]'s grandson, Merlin Holland, argues: \"One is taking it out of context, [0] was not an odious predator. The boys seemed to be willing partners and there appeared to be a relationship going on between [0] and The boys\". Marriageable age (and the age of consent) in the United Kingdom was 16 at the time, having been 13 as recently as 1885: the 1875 Offences against the Person Act 1875 raised the age of consent to 13 years old, and a decade later, the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 raised the age of consent to 16 years old, just ten years before his prosecution.", "": ""}, "Imprisonment": {"": "[0]  is our person to focus on. When first [0] was put into prison some people advised [0] to try and forget who [0] was. advised was ruinous advice. It is only by realising what [0] am that [0] have found comfort of any kind. Now [0] am advised by others to try on [0]'s release to forget that [0] have ever been in a prison at all. [0] know forget would be equally fatal. forget would mean that [0] would always be haunted by an intolerable sense of disgrace, and that those things that are meant for me as much as for anybody else\u00a0\u2013 the beauty of the sun and moon, the pageant of the seasons, the music of daybreak and the silence of great nights, the rain falling through the leaves, or the dew creeping over the grass and making the grass silver\u00a0\u2013 would all be tainted for [0], and lose those things that are meant for me as much as for anybody else's healing power, and those things that are meant for me as much as for anybody else's power of communicating joy. To regret one's own experiences is to arrest one's own development. To deny one's own experiences is to put a lie into the lips of one's own life. deny is no less than a denial of the soul.De ProfundisHaving been convicted in \"one of the first celebrity trials\", [0] was incarcerated from 25 May 1895 to 18 May 1897.He first entered Newgate Prison in London for processing, then was moved to Pentonville Prison, where the \"hard labour\" to which [0] had been sentenced consisted of many hours of walking a treadmill and picking oakum (separating the fibres in scraps of old navy ropes), and where prisoners were allowed to read only the Bible and The Pilgrim's Progress.A few months later [0] was moved to Wandsworth Prison in London. Inmates there also followed the regimen of \"hard labour, hard fare and a hard bed\", which wore harshly on [0]'s delicate health. In November [0] collapsed during chapel from illness and hunger. [0]'s right ear drum was ruptured in the fall, an injury that later contributed to [0]'s death. [0] spent two months in the infirmary.Richard B. Haldane, the Liberal MP and reformer, visited [0] and had [0] transferred in November to Reading Gaol, 30 miles (48\u00a0km) west of London on 23 November 1895. transferred was the lowest point of [0]'s incarceration, as a crowd jeered and spat at [0] on the platform at Clapham Junction railway station (in 2019 a rainbow plaque was unveiled at Clapham Junction railway station recalling this event). [0] spent the remainder of [0]'s sentence at Reading, addressed and identified only as \"C.3.3\" \u2013 the occupant of the third cell on the third floor of C ward.About five months after [0] arrived at Reading Gaol, 30 miles (48\u00a0km) west of London, Charles Thomas Wooldridge, a trooper in the Royal Horse Guards, was brought to Reading to await Charles Thomas Wooldridge, a trooper in the Royal Horse Guards,'s trial for murdering Charles Thomas Wooldridge, a trooper in the Royal Horse Guards,'s wife on 29 March 1896; on 17 June Charles Thomas Wooldridge, a trooper in the Royal Horse Guards, was sentenced to death and returned to Reading for his execution, which took place on Tuesday, 7 July 1896 \u2013 the first hanging at Reading in 18 years. From his execution, which took place on Tuesday, 7 July 1896, [0] later wrote The Ballad of Reading Reading Gaol, 30 miles (48\u00a0km) west of London.[0] was not, at first, even allowed paper and pen, but Richard B. Haldane, the Liberal MP and reformer, eventually succeeded in allowing access to books and writing materials. [0] requested, among others, the Bible in French; Italian and German grammars; some Ancient Greek texts; Dante's Divine Comedy; Joris-Karl Huysmans's new French novel about Christian redemption, En route; and essays by St Augustine, Cardinal Newman and Walter Pater.Between January and March 1897 [0] wrote a 50,000-word letter to Douglas. [0] was not allowed to send a 50,000-word letter, but was permitted to take a 50,000-word letter with [0] when released from prison. In reflective mode, [0] coldly examines [0]'s career to date, how [0] had been a colourful agent provocateur in Victorian society, [0]'s art, like [0]'s paradoxes, seeking to subvert as well as sparkle. [0]'s own estimation of [0] was: one who \"stood in symbolic relations to the art and culture of [0]'s age\". It was from these heights that his life with Douglas began, and [0] examines his life with Douglas particularly closely, repudiating Douglas for what [0] finally sees as Douglas's arrogance and vanity: [0] had not forgotten Douglas's remark, when Douglas was ill, \"When you are not on your pedestal you are not interesting.\" [0] blamed [0], though, for the ethical degradation of character that [0] allowed Douglas to bring about in [0], and took responsibility for [0]'s own fall: \"[0] am here for having tried to put Douglas in prison.\" The first half concludes with [0] forgiving Douglas, for [0]'s own sake as much as Douglas's. The second half of a 50,000-word letter traces [0]'s spiritual journey of redemption and fulfilment through [0]'s prison reading. [0] realised that [0]'s ordeal had filled his soul with the fruit of experience, however bitter his soul tasted at the time. ... [0] wanted to eat of the fruit of all the trees in the garden of the world ... And so, indeed, [0] went out, and so [0] lived. [0]'s only mistake was that [0] confined [0] so exclusively to the trees of what seemed to [0] the sun-lit side of the garden of the world, and shunned the other side for the other side's shadow and the other side's gloom.[0] was released from prison on 19 May 1897 and sailed that evening for Dieppe, France. [0] never returned to the United Kingdom.On [0]'s , [0] gave a 50,000-word letter to Ross, who may or may not have carried out [0]'s instructions to send a copy to Douglas (who later denied having received a copy). a 50,000-word letter was partially published in 1905 as De Profundis; a 50,000-word letter's complete and correct publication first occurred in 1962 in The Letters of [0]."}, "Decline: 1897\u20131900": {"Exile": "[0]  is our person to focus on. Though [0]'s health had suffered greatly from the harshness and diet of prison, [0] had a feeling of spiritual renewal. [0] immediately wrote to the Society of Jesus requesting a six-month Catholic retreat; when requesting was denied, [0] wept. \"[0] intend to be received into the Catholic Church before long\", [0] told a journalist who asked about [0]'s religious intentions.[0] spent [0]'s last three years impoverished and in exile. [0] took the name \"Sebastian Melmoth\", after Saint Sebastian and the titular character of Melmoth the Wanderer (a Gothic novel by Charles Maturin, [0]'s great-uncle). [0] wrote two long letters to the editor of the Daily Chronicle, describing the brutal conditions of English prisons and advocating penal reform. [0]'s discussion of the dismissal of Warder Martin for giving biscuits to an anaemic child prisoner repeated the themes of the corruption and degeneration of punishment that [0] had earlier outlined in The Soul of Man under Socialism.[0] spent mid-1897 with Robert Ross in the seaside village of Berneval-le-Grand in northern France, where [0] wrote The Ballad of Reading Gaol, narrating the execution of Charles Thomas Wooldridge, who murdered his wife in a rage at her infidelity. The Ballad of Reading Gaol, narrating the execution of Charles Thomas Wooldridge, who murdered his wife in a rage at her infidelity moves from an objective story-telling to symbolic identification with the prisoners. No attempt is made to assess the justice of the laws which convicted the prisoners but rather The Ballad of Reading Gaol, narrating the execution of Charles Thomas Wooldridge, who murdered his wife in a rage at her infidelity highlights the brutality of the punishment that all convicts share. [0] juxtaposes Charles Thomas Wooldridge, who murdered his wife in a rage at her infidelity and [0] with the line \"Yet each man kills the thing each man loves\". [0] adopted the proletarian ballad form and [0] was credited as \"C33\", [0]'s cell number in Reading Gaol. [0] suggested that The Ballad of Reading Gaol, narrating the execution of Charles Thomas Wooldridge, who murdered his wife in a rage at her infidelity be published in Reynolds' Magazine, \"because The Ballad of Reading Gaol, narrating the execution of Charles Thomas Wooldridge, who murdered his wife in a rage at her infidelity circulates widely among the criminal classes\u00a0\u2013 to which [0] now belong\u00a0\u2013 for once [0] will be read by [0]'s peers\u00a0\u2013 a new experience for [0]\". The Ballad of Reading Gaol, narrating the execution of Charles Thomas Wooldridge, who murdered his wife in a rage at her infidelity was an immediate roaring commercial success, going through seven editions in less than two years, only after which \"[Oscar Wilde]\" was added to the title page, though many in literary circles had known [0] to be the author.Although Douglas had been the cause of Douglas's misfortunes, he and Wilde were reunited in August 1897 at Rouen. reunited was disapproved of by the friends and families of he and Wilde. Constance Wilde was already refusing to meet [0] or allow [0] to see he and Wilde's sons, though Constance Wilde sent [0] money \u2013 three pounds a week. During the latter part of 1897, he and Wilde lived together near Naples for a few months until he and Wilde were separated by he and Wilde's families under the threat of cutting off all funds.[0]'s final address was at the dingy H\u00f4tel d'Alsace (now known as L'H\u00f4tel), on rue des Beaux-Arts in Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s, Paris. \"This poverty really breaks one's heart: This poverty is so sale [filthy], so utterly depressing, so hopeless. Pray do what you can\" [0] wrote to [0]'s publisher. [0] corrected and published An Ideal Husband and The Importance of Being Earnest, the proofs of which, according to Ellmann, show a man \"very much in command of [0] and of the play\", but [0] refused to write anything else: \"[0] can write, but have lost the joy of writing\".[0] wandered the boulevards alone and spent what little money [0] had on alcohol. A series of embarrassing chance encounters with hostile English visitors, or Frenchmen [0] had known in better days, drowned [0]'s spirit. Soon [0] was sufficiently confined to the dingy H\u00f4tel d'Alsace (now known as L'H\u00f4tel), on rue des Beaux-Arts in Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s, Paris to joke, on one of [0]'s final trips outside, \"My wallpaper and I are fighting a duel to the death. One of My wallpaper and I has got to go\". On 12 October 1900 [0] sent a telegram to Robert Ross: \"Terribly weak. Please come\". [0]'s moods fluctuated; Max Beerbohm relates how their mutual friend Reginald 'Reggie' Turner had found [0] very depressed after a nightmare. \"[0] dreamt that [0] had died, and was supping with the dead!\" \"their mutual friend Reginald 'Reggie' Turner am sure,\" their mutual friend Reginald 'Reggie' Turner replied, \"that [0] must have been the life and soul of the party.\"", "Death": "[0]  is our person to focus on. By 25 November 1900, [0] had developed meningitis, then called \"cerebral meningitis\". Robbie Ross arrived on 29 November, sent for a priest, and [0] was conditionally baptised into the Catholic Church by Fr Cuthbert Dunne, a Passionist priest from Dublin, [0] having been baptised in the Church of Ireland and having moreover a recollection of Catholic baptism as a child, a fact later attested to by the minister of the sacrament, Fr Lawrence Fox. Fr Cuthbert Dunne, a Passionist priest from Dublin recorded baptised: As the voiture rolled through the dark streets that wintry night, the sad story of [0] was in part repeated to Fr Cuthbert Dunne, a Passionist priest from Dublin... Robbie Ross knelt by the bedside, assisting Fr Cuthbert Dunne, a Passionist priest from Dublin as best Robbie Ross could while Fr Cuthbert Dunne, a Passionist priest from Dublin administered conditional baptism, and afterwards answering the responses while Fr Cuthbert Dunne, a Passionist priest from Dublin gave Extreme Unction to [0] and recited the prayers for the dying. As [0] was in a semi-comatose condition, Fr Cuthbert Dunne, a Passionist priest from Dublin did not venture to administer the Holy Viaticum; still Fr Cuthbert Dunne, a Passionist priest from Dublin must add that [0] could be roused and was roused from a semi-comatose condition in Fr Cuthbert Dunne, a Passionist priest from Dublin's presence. When roused, [0] gave signs of being inwardly conscious... Indeed Fr Cuthbert Dunne, a Passionist priest from Dublin was fully satisfied that [0] understood Fr Cuthbert Dunne, a Passionist priest from Dublin when told that Fr Cuthbert Dunne, a Passionist priest from Dublin was about to receive [0] into the Catholic Church and gave [0] the Last Sacraments... And when Fr Cuthbert Dunne, a Passionist priest from Dublin repeated close to [0]'s ear the Holy Names, the Acts of Contrition, Faith, Hope and Charity, with acts of humble resignation to the Will of God, [0] tried all through to say the words after Fr Cuthbert Dunne, a Passionist priest from Dublin. [0] died of meningitis, then called \"cerebral meningitis\" on 30 November 1900. Different opinions are given as to the cause of meningitis, then called \"cerebral meningitis\": Richard Ellmann judged meningitis, then called \"cerebral meningitis\" was syphilitic; Merlin Holland, [0]'s grandson, thought judged to be a misconception, noting that meningitis, then called \"cerebral meningitis\" followed a surgical intervention, perhaps a mastoidectomy; [0]'s physicians, Paul Cleiss and A'Court Tucker, reported that meningitis, then called \"cerebral meningitis\" stemmed from an old suppuration of the right ear (from the prison injury, see above) treated for several years (une ancienne suppuration de l'oreille droite d'ailleurs en traitement depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es) and made no allusion to syphilis.", "Burial": "[0]  is our person to focus on. [0] was initially buried in the Cimeti\u00e8re de Bagneux outside Paris; in 1909 [0]'s remains were disinterred and transferred to P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery, inside Paris. His tomb there was designed by Sir Jacob Epstein. His tomb there was commissioned by Robert Ross, who asked for a small compartment to be made for his own ashes, which were duly transferred in 1950Robert Ross, who asked for a small compartment to be made for his own ashes, which were duly transferred in 1950's . The modernist angel depicted as a relief on His tomb there was originally complete with male genitalia, which were initially censored by French authorities with a golden leaf. male genitalia have since been vandalised; male genitalia's current whereabouts are unknown. In 2000, Leon Johnson, a multimedia artist, installed a silver prosthesis to replace male genitalia. In 2011, His tomb there was cleaned of the many lipstick marks left there by admirers and a glass barrier was installed to prevent further marks or damage.The epitaph is a verse from The Ballad of Reading Gaol,And alien tears will fill for [0]'s long-broken urn,For [0]'s mourners will be outcast men,And outcasts always mourn.", "Posthumous pardon": "[0]  is our person to focus on.

Wilde's life has been the subject of numerous biographies since [0]'s death. The earliest were memoirs by those who knew him: often memoirs by those who knew him are personal or impressionistic accounts which can be good character sketches, but are sometimes factually unreliable. Frank Harris, [0]'s friend and editor, wrote a biography, Oscar Wilde: His Life and Confessions (1916); though prone to exaggeration and sometimes factually inaccurate, a biography, Oscar Wilde: His Life and Confessions (1916) offers a good literary portrait of [0]. Lord Alfred Douglas wrote two books about his relationship with Wilde. Oscar Wilde and Myself (1914), largely ghost-written by T. W. H. Crosland, vindictively reacted to Lord Alfred Douglas's discovery that De Profundis was addressed to Lord Alfred Douglas and defensively tried to distance Lord Alfred Douglas from [0]'s scandalous reputation. Both authors later regretted two books about his relationship with Wilde. Later, in Oscar Wilde: A Summing Up (1939) and Lord Alfred Douglas's Autobiography, Lord Alfred Douglas was more sympathetic to [0]. Of [0]'s other close friends, Robert Sherard; Robert Ross, [0]'s literary executor; and Charles Ricketts variously published biographies, reminiscences or correspondence. The first more or less objective biography of [0] came about when Hesketh Pearson wrote Oscar Wilde: [0]'s Life and Wit (1946). In 1954 Wilde's son Vyvyan Holland published his memoir Son of Oscar Wilde, which recounts the difficulties Wilde's wife and children faced after his imprisonment. his memoir Son of Oscar Wilde, which recounts the difficulties Wilde's wife and children faced after his imprisonment was revised and updated by Merlin Holland in 1989.Oscar Wilde, a critical study by Arthur Ransome was published in 1912. 1989.Oscar Wilde, a critical study by Arthur Ransome only briefly mentioned Wilde's life, but subsequently Arthur Ransome (and The Times Book Club) were sued for libel by Lord Alfred Douglas. At the High Court in London in April 1913, Lord Alfred Douglas lost sued after a reading of De Profundis refuted Lord Alfred Douglas's claims.Richard Ellmann wrote his 1987 biography Oscar Wilde, for which he posthumously won a National (US) Book Critics Circle Award in 1988 and a Pulitzer Prize in 1989. his 1987 biography Oscar Wilde, for which he posthumously won a National (US) Book Critics Circle Award in 1988 and a Pulitzer Prize in 1989 was the basis for the 1997 film Wilde, directed by Brian Gilbert and starring Stephen Fry as the title character.Neil McKenna's 2003 biography, The Secret Life of Oscar Wilde, offers an exploration of [0]'s sexuality. Often speculative in nature, Neil McKenna's 2003 biography, The Secret Life of Oscar Wilde, was widely criticised for Neil McKenna's 2003 biography, The Secret Life of Oscar Wilde,'s pure conjecture and lack of scholarly rigour. Thomas Wright's's Oscar's Books (2008) explores [0]'s reading from [0]'s childhood in Dublin to [0]'s death in Paris. After tracking down many books that once belonged to [0]'s Tite Street library (dispersed at the time of [0]'s trials), Thomas Wright's was the first to examine [0]'s marginalia.Later on, Thomas Wright's think everyone will recognise [0]'s achievements; [0]'s plays and essays will endure. Of course, you may think with others that [0]'s personality and conversation were far more wonderful than anything [0] wrote, so that [0]'s written works give only a pale reflection of [0]'s power. Perhaps that is so, and of course, it will be impossible to reproduce what is gone forever.Robert Ross, 23 December 1900In 2018, Matthew Sturgis' Oscar: A Life, was published in London. Matthew Sturgis' Oscar: A Life, incorporates rediscovered letters and other documents and is the most extensively researched biography of [0] to appear since 1988. Rupert Everett starred as [0] in, and wrote the screenplay for, The Happy Prince (2018), a biographical drama film about [0] following [0]'s release from prison.Parisian literati also produced several biographies and monographs on [0].
