[0] was inspired by miler Sydney Wooderson's's comeback in 1945. Eight years after setting the mile record and seeing the mile record surpassed during the war years by the Swedish runners Arne Andersson and Gunder H\u00e4gg, miler Sydney Wooderson's regained miler Sydney Wooderson's's old form and challenged Arne Andersson over the mile record in several races. miler Sydney Wooderson's lost to Arne Andersson but set a British record of 4:04.2 in Gothenburg on 9 September.Like miler Sydney Wooderson's, [0] would ultimately set a mile record, see a mile record broken, and then set a new personal best slower than the new record.[0] started [0]'s running career at Oxford in the autumn of 1946 at the age of 17. [0] had never worn running spikes previously or run on a track. [0]'s training was light, even compared to the standards of the day, but [0] showed promise in running a mile in 1947 in 4:24.6 on only three weekly half-hour training sessions.[0] was selected as an Olympic \"possible\" in 1948 but declined as [0] felt [0] was not ready to compete at that level. However, [0] was further inspired to become a great miler by watching the 1948 Olympics. [0] set [0]'s training goals on the 1952 Olympics in Helsinki.In 1949, [0] improved in the 880-yard (804.67\u00a0m) run to 1:52.7 and won several mile races in 4:11. Then, after a period of six weeks with no training, [0] came in third at White City in 4:14.2.The year 1950 saw more improvements as [0] finished a relatively slow 4:13-mile on 1 July with an impressive 57.5 last quarter. Then, [0] ran the AAA 880 in 1:52.1, losing to Arthur Wint, and then ran 1:50.7 for the 800 m at the European Championships on 26 August, placing third. Chastened by this lack of success, [0] started to train harder and more seriously.[0]'s increased attention to training paid quick dividends, as [0] won a mile race in 4:09.9 on 30 December. Then in 1951 at the Penn Relays, [0] broke away from the pack with a 56.7 final lap, finishing in 4:08.3. Then, in [0]'s biggest test to date, [0] won a mile race on 14 July in 4:07.8 at the AAA Championships at White City before 47,000 people. The time set a meet record and [0] defeated defending champion Bill Nankeville in the process.[0] suffered defeat, however, when Yugoslavia's Andrija Otenhajmer, aware of [0]'s final-lap kick, took a 1500 m race in Belgrade 25 August out at near-record pace, forcing [0] to close the gap by the bell lap. Yugoslavia's Andrija Otenhajmer won in 3:47.0, though [0] set a personal best finishing second in 3:48.4. [0] was no longer seen as invincible.[0]'s training was a very modern individualised mixture of interval training influenced by coach Franz Stampfl with elements of block periodisation, fell running and anaerobic elements of training which were later perfected by Arthur Lydiard.From 1951 to 1954, [0] trained at the track at Paddington Recreation Ground in Maida Vale while [0] was a medical student at the nearby St Mary's Hospital. There are two [0] plaques at the pavilion, both unveiled by [0] on 10 September 2000; a circular blue plaque and a rectangular historic plaque containing additional information. According to a rectangular historic plaque containing additional information, [0] was able to train for just an hour each day due to [0]'s medical studies.", "1952 Olympics": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] avoided racing after the 1951 season until late in the spring of 1952, saving [0]'s energy for Helsinki and the Olympics. [0] ran an 880-yard (800\u00a0m) run on 28 May 1952 in 1:53.00, followed by a 4:10.6-mile time-trial on 7 June, proclaiming [0] satisfied with the results. At the AAA championships, [0] skipped the mile and won the 880 in 1:51.5. Then, 10\u00a0days before the Olympic final, [0] ran a 3\u20444 mile time trial in 2:52.9, which gave [0] confidence that [0] was ready for the Olympics as [0] considered a 3\u20444 mile time trial to be the equivalent of a four-minute mile.[0]'s confidence soon dissipated, however, as it was announced there would be semi-finals for the 1500 m (equal to 0.932 miles) at the Olympics, which [0] felt favoured runners who had much deeper training regimens than [0] did. When [0] ran [0]'s semi-final, [0] finished fifth and thereby qualified for the Olympic final, but [0] felt \"blown and unhappy\".the Olympic final would prove to be one of the more dramatic in Olympic history. the Olympic final was not decided until the final metres, Josy Barthel of Luxembourg prevailing in an Olympic-record 3:45.28 (3:45.1 by official hand-timing) with the next seven runners all under the old record. [0] finished fourth, out of the medals, but set a British record of 3:46.30 (3:46.0) in the process.", "New goal": "[0] is our person to focus on. After [0]'s relative failure at the 1952 Olympics, [0] spent two months deciding whether to give up running. [0] set [0] on a new goal: to be the first man to run a mile in under four minutes. Accordingly, [0] intensified [0]'s training and did hard intervals.On 2 May 1953, [0] made an attempt on the British record at Oxford. Paced by Chris Chataway, [0] ran 4:03.6, shattering Wooderson's 1945 standard. \"an attempt on the British record at Oxford made [0] realise that the four-minute mile was not out of reach,\" said [0].On 27 June 1953, a mile race was inserted into the programme of the Surrey schools athletic meeting. Australian runner Don Macmillan, ninth in the 1500 m at the 1952 Olympics, set a strong pace with 59.6 for one lap and 1:59.7 for two. Australian runner Don Macmillan, ninth in the 1500 m at the 1952 Olympics, gave up after two and a half laps, but Chris Brasher took up the pace. Chris Brasher had jogged a mile race, allowing [0] to lap Chris Brasher so [0] could be a fresh pace-setter. At 3\u20444 mile, [0] was at 3:01.8, the record\u2014and first sub-four-minute mile\u2014in reach. But the effort fell short with a finish in 4:02.0, a time bettered by only Arne Andersson (4:01.6 in 1944) and Gunder H\u00e4gg (4:01.4 in 1945). British officials would not allow this performance to stand as a British record, which, [0] felt in retrospect, was a good decision. \"[0]'s feeling as [0] look back is one of great relief that [0] did not run a four-minute mile under such artificial circumstances,\" [0] said.But other runners were making attempts at the four-minute barrier and coming close as well. American Wes Santee ran 4:02.4 on 5 June 1953, the fourth-fastest mile ever. And at the end of 1953, Australian John Landy ran 4:02.0.Then early in 1954, Australian John Landy made some more attempts at the distance. On 21 January 1954, Australian John Landy ran 4:02.4 in Melbourne, then 4:02.6 on 23 February 1954, and at the end of the Australian season on 19 April Australian John Landy ran 4:02.6 again.[0] had been following Landy's attempts and was certain Australian John Landy would succeed with each one. But knowing that Landy's attempts would be Australian John Landy's last until Australian John Landy travelled to Finland for another attempt, [0] knew [0] had to make [0]'s attempt soon.", "Sub-4-minute mile": "Roger Bannister is our person to focus on. [0] took place on 6 May 1954 during a meet between British AAA and Oxford University at Iffley Road Track in Oxford, watched by about 3,000 spectators. With winds of up to twenty-five miles per hour (40\u00a0km/h) before [0], Roger Bannister had said twice that Roger Bannister preferred not to run, to conserve Roger Bannister's energy and efforts to break the 4-minute barrier; Roger Bannister would try again at another meet. However, the winds dropped just before [0] was scheduled to begin, and Roger Bannister did run.The pace-setters from Roger Bannister's major 1953 attempts, future Commonwealth Games gold medallist Christopher Chataway from the 2 May attempt, and future Olympic Games gold medallist Chris Brasher from the 27 June attempt, combined to provide pacing for Roger Bannister's . [0] was broadcast live by BBC Radio and commentated by 1924 Olympic 100 metres champion Harold Abrahams, of Chariots of Fire fame.Roger Bannister had begun Roger Bannister's day at a hospital in London, where Roger Bannister sharpened his racing spikes and rubbed graphite on his racing spikes so his racing spikes would not pick up too much cinder ash. Roger Bannister took a mid-morning train from Paddington Station to Oxford, nervous about the rainy, windy conditions that afternoon.Being a dual-meet format, there were seven men entered in the mile: Alan Gordon, George Dole and Nigel Miller from Oxford University; and four British AAA runners: Roger Bannister, Roger Bannister's two pacemakers future Commonwealth Games gold medallist Christopher Chataway from the 2 May attempt and future Commonwealth Games gold medallist Christopher Chataway from the 2 May attempt, and Tom Hulatt. Nigel Miller arrived as a spectator and Nigel Miller only realised that Nigel Miller was due to run when Nigel Miller read the programme. Efforts to borrow a running kit failed and Nigel Miller could not take part, thus reducing the field to six.[0] went off as scheduled at 6:00\u00a0pm, and future Commonwealth Games gold medallist Christopher Chataway from the 2 May attempt and Roger Bannister went immediately to the front of the field. future Commonwealth Games gold medallist Christopher Chataway from the 2 May attempt led both the first lap in 58\u00a0seconds and the half-mile in 1:58, with Roger Bannister tucked in behind, and future Commonwealth Games gold medallist Christopher Chataway from the 2 May attempt a stride behind Roger Bannister. future Commonwealth Games gold medallist Christopher Chataway from the 2 May attempt moved to the front after the second lap and maintained the pace with a 3:01 split at the final lap bell. future Commonwealth Games gold medallist Christopher Chataway from the 2 May attempt continued to lead around the front turn until Roger Bannister began Roger Bannister's finishing kick with about 275\u00a0yards to go (just over half a lap), running the last lap in just under 59\u00a0seconds.The stadium announcer for [0] was Norris McWhirter, who went on to co-publish and co-edit the Guinness Book of Records. Norris McWhirter, who went on to co-publish and co-edit the Guinness Book of Records teased the crowd by delaying Norris McWhirter, who went on to co-publish and co-edit the Guinness Book of Records's for as long as possible:Ladies and gentlemen, here is the result of [0]: first, number forty one, R.

Bannister's race time was three... The roar of the crowd drowned out the rest of his announcement of Bannister's race time. Bannister's race time was 3\u00a0minutes 59.4\u00a0seconds.The claim that a four-minute mile was once thought to be impossible by \"informed\" observers was and is a widely propagated myth created by sportswriters and debunked by Roger Bannister in Roger Bannister's memoir, The Four Minute Mile (1955).The reason The claim that a four-minute mile was once thought to be impossible by \"informed\" observers took hold was that four minutes was a round number that lay slightly out of reach of the world record (by just 1.4\u00a0seconds) for nine years, which was longer than it might otherwise have been due to the effect of the Second World War in interrupting athletic progress in the combatant countries.[citation needed] The Swedish runners, Gunder H\u00e4gg and Arne Andersson, in a series of head-to-head races in the period 1942\u201345, had already lowered the world record by five seconds to the pre-Roger Bannister record. Knowledgeable track fans are still most impressed by the fact that Roger Bannister ran a four-minute mile on very low-mileage training by modern standards.[citation needed]Just 46 days later, on 21 June 1954, Roger Bannister's record was broken by Roger Bannister's rival, John Landy, in Turku, Finland, with a time of 3\u00a0minutes 57.9\u00a0seconds, which the IAAF ratified as 3\u00a0minutes 58.0\u00a0seconds due to the rounding rules then in effect.", "1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games": "Roger Bannister is our person to focus on.
