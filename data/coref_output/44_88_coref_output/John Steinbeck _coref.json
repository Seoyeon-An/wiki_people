[0] was born on February 27, 1902, in Salinas, California. [0] was of German, English, and Irish descent. Johann Adolf Gro\u00dfsteinbeck (1828\u20131913), Steinbeck's paternal grandfather, was a founder of Mount Hope, a short-lived messianic farming colony in Palestine that disbanded after Arab attackers killed Johann Adolf Gro\u00dfsteinbeck (1828\u20131913), Steinbeck's paternal grandfather,'s and raped Johann Adolf Gro\u00dfsteinbeck (1828\u20131913), Steinbeck's paternal grandfather,'s wife and mother-in-law. Johann Adolf Gro\u00dfsteinbeck (1828\u20131913), Steinbeck's paternal grandfather, arrived in the United States in 1858, shortening the family name to Steinbeck. The family farm in Heiligenhaus, Mettmann, Germany, is still named \"Gro\u00dfsteinbeck\".[0]'s father, John Ernst Steinbeck (1862\u20131935), served as Monterey County treasurer. [0]'s mother, Olive Hamilton (1867\u20131934), a former school teacher, shared [0]'s passion for reading and writing. The Steinbecks were members of the Episcopal Church, although [0] later became agnostic. [0] lived in a small rural valley (no more than a frontier settlement) set in some of the world's most fertile soil, about 25 miles from the Pacific Coast.  Both valley and coast would serve as settings for some of [0]'s best fiction. [0] spent [0]'s summers working on nearby ranches including the Post Ranch in Big Sur. [0] later labored with migrant workers on Spreckels sugar beet farms. There [0] learned of the harsher aspects of the migrant life and the darker side of human nature, which supplied [0] with material expressed in Of Mice and Men. [0] explored [0]'s surroundings, walking across local forests, fields, and farms. While working at Spreckels, [0] sometimes worked in Spreckels's laboratory, which gave [0] time to write. [0] had considerable mechanical aptitude and fondness for repairing things [0] owned.[0] graduated from Salinas High School in 1919 and went on to study English literature at Stanford University near Palo Alto, leaving without a degree in 1925. [0] traveled to New York City where [0] took odd jobs while trying to write. When [0] failed to publish [0]'s work, [0] returned to California and worked in 1928 as a tour guide and caretaker at Lake Tahoe, where [0] met Carol Henning, his first wife. They married in January 1930 in Los Angeles, where, with friends, [0] attempted to make money by manufacturing plaster mannequins.When They's money ran out six months later due to a slow market, [0] Carol Henning, his first wife moved back to Pacific Grove, California, to a cottage owned by [0]'s father, on the Monterey Peninsula a few blocks outside the Monterey city limits. The elder Steinbecks gave [0] free housing, paper for [0]'s manuscripts, and from 1928, loans that allowed [0] to write without looking for work. During the Great Depression, [0] bought a small boat, and later claimed that [0] was able to live on the fish and crabs that [0] gathered from the sea, and fresh vegetables from [0]'s garden and local farms. When those sources failed, [0] Carol Henning, his first wife accepted welfare, and on rare occasions, stole bacon from the local produce market. Whatever food They had, They shared with They's friends. Carol Henning, his first wife became the model for Mary Talbot in [0]'s novel Cannery Row.In 1930, [0] met the marine biologist Ed Ricketts, who became a close friend and mentor to Steinbeck during the following decade, teaching him a great deal about philosophy and biology. Ricketts, usually very quiet, yet likable, with an inner self-sufficiency and an encyclopedic knowledge of diverse subjects, became a focus of [0]'s attention. the marine biologist Ed Ricketts, who became a close friend and mentor to Steinbeck during the following decade, teaching him a great deal about philosophy and biology had taken a college class from Warder Clyde Allee, a biologist and ecological theorist, who would go on to write a classic early textbook on ecology. the marine biologist Ed Ricketts, who became a close friend and mentor to Steinbeck during the following decade, teaching him a great deal about philosophy and biology became a proponent of ecological thinking, in which man was only one part of a great chain of being, caught in a web of life too large for man to control or understand. Meanwhile, the marine biologist Ed Ricketts, who became a close friend and mentor to Steinbeck during the following decade, teaching him a great deal about philosophy and biology operated a biological lab on the coast of Monterey, selling biological samples of small animals, fish, rays, starfish, turtles, and other marine forms to schools and colleges.Between 1930 and 1936, [0] the marine biologist Ed Ricketts, who became a close friend and mentor to Steinbeck during the following decade, teaching him a great deal about philosophy and biology became close friends. Carol Henning, his first wife began working at a biological lab as secretary-bookkeeper. [0] helped on an informal basis. They formed a common bond based on They's love of music and art, and [0] learned biology and [0]'s ecological philosophy. When [0] became emotionally upset, [0] sometimes played music for [0]."}, "Career": {"Writing": "[0]  is our person to focus on. Steinbeck's first novel, Cup of Gold, published in 1929, is loosely based on the life and death of privateer Henry Morgan. Steinbeck's first novel, Cup of Gold, published in 1929, centers on privateer Henry Morgan's assault and sacking of Panam\u00e1 Viejo, sometimes referred to as the \"Cup of Gold\", and on the women, brighter than the sun, who were said to be found there. In 1930, [0] wrote a werewolf murder mystery, Murder at Full Moon, that has never been published because [0] considered a werewolf murder mystery, Murder at Full Moon unworthy of publication.Between 1930 and 1933, [0] produced three shorter works. The Pastures of Heaven, published in 1932, consists of twelve interconnected stories about a valley near Monterey, which was discovered by a Spanish corporal while chasing runaway Indian slaves.

Although [0] had not achieved the status of a well-known writer, [0] never doubted that [0] would achieve greatness.[0] achieved [0]'s first critical success with his novel Tortilla Flat (1935). his novel Tortilla Flat (1935) portrays the adventures of a group of classless and usually homeless young men in Monterey after World War I, just before U.S. prohibition. a group of classless and usually homeless young men are portrayed in ironic comparison to mythic knights on a quest and reject nearly all the standard mores of American society in enjoyment of a dissolute life devoted to wine, lust, camaraderie and petty theft. In presenting the 1962 Nobel Prize to [0], the Swedish Academy cited \"spicy and comic tales about a gang of paisanos, asocial individuals who, in their wild revels, are almost caricatures of King Arthur's Knights of the Round Tablea gang of paisanos, asocial individuals who, in their wild revels, are almost caricatures of King Arthur's Knights of the Round Table's . It has been said that in the United States his novel Tortilla Flat (1935) came as a welcome antidote to the gloom of the then prevailing depression.\" Tortilla Flat was adapted as a 1942 film of the same name, starring Spencer Tracy, Hedy Lamarr and John Garfield, a friend of [0]. With some of the proceeds, [0] built a summer ranch-home in Los Gatos.[citation [0] began to write a series of \"California novels\" and Dust Bowl fiction, set among common people during the Great Depression. a series of \"California novels\" and Dust Bowl fiction, set among common people during the Great Depression included In Dubious Battle, Of Mice and Men and The Grapes of Wrath. [0] also wrote an article series called The Harvest Gypsies for the San Francisco News about the plight of the migrant worker.Of Mice and Men was a drama about the dreams of two migrant agricultural laborers in California. Of Mice and Men was critically acclaimed and the 1962 Nobel Prize the 1962 Nobel Prize citation called Of Mice and Men a \"little masterpiece\".Of Mice and Men's was a hit, starring Wallace Ford as George and Broderick Crawford as George's companion, the mentally childlike, but physically powerful itinerant farmhand Lennie. [0] refused to travel from [0]'s home in California to attend any performance of Of Mice and Men during Of Mice and Men's New York run, telling director George S. Kaufman that the play as it existed in his own mind the play as it existed in his own mind was \"perfect\" and that anything presented on stage would only be a disappointment. [0] wrote two more stage plays (The Moon Is Down and Burning Bright).Of Mice and Men was also adapted as a 1939 Hollywood film, with Lon Chaney Jr. as George's companion, the mentally childlike, but physically powerful itinerant farmhand Lennie (Lon Chaney Jr. had filled George's companion, the mentally childlike, but physically powerful itinerant farmhand Lennie in Its stage production) and Burgess Meredith as George. Burgess Meredith and [0] became close friends for the next two decades. Another film based on Of Mice and Men was made in 1992 starring Gary Sinise as George and John Malkovich as George's companion, the mentally childlike, but physically powerful itinerant farmhand Lennie.[0] followed this wave of success with The Grapes of Wrath (1939), based on newspaper articles about migrant agricultural workers that he had written in San Francisco. The Grapes of Wrath (1939), based on newspaper articles about migrant agricultural workers that he had written in San Francisco is commonly considered [0]'s greatest work. According to The New York Times, The Grapes of Wrath (1939), based on newspaper articles about migrant agricultural workers that he had written in San Francisco was the best-selling book of 1939 and 430,000 copies had been printed by February 1940. In February 1940, The Grapes of Wrath (1939), based on newspaper articles about migrant agricultural workers that he had written in San Francisco won the National Book Award, favorite fiction book of 1939, voted by members of the American Booksellers Association. Later 1940, The Grapes of Wrath (1939), based on newspaper articles about migrant agricultural workers that he had written in San Francisco won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and was adapted as a film directed by John Ford, starring Henry Fonda as Tom Joad; Henry Fonda as Tom Joad was nominated for the best actor Academy Award. The Grapes of Wrath (1939), based on newspaper articles about migrant agricultural workers that he had written in San Francisco was controversial. [0]'s New Deal political views, negative portrayal of aspects of capitalism, and sympathy for the plight of workers, led to a backlash against [0], especially close to home. Claiming The Grapes of Wrath (1939), based on newspaper articles about migrant agricultural workers that he had written in San Francisco both was obscene and misrepresented conditions in the county, the the county Board of Supervisors banned The Grapes of Wrath (1939), based on newspaper articles about migrant agricultural workers that he had written in San Francisco from the county's publicly funded schools and libraries in August 1939. banned lasted until January 1941.Of the controversy, [0] wrote, \"The vilification of [0] out here from the large landowners and bankers is pretty bad. The latest is a rumor started by the large landowners and bankers that the Okies hate [0] and have threatened to kill [0] for lying about the Okies. [0]'m frightened at the rolling might of The Grapes of Wrath (1939), based on newspaper articles about migrant agricultural workers that he had written in San Francisco. It is completely out of hand; [0] mean a kind of hysteria about The Grapes of Wrath (1939), based on newspaper articles about migrant agricultural workers that he had written in San Francisco is growing that is not healthy.\"The film versions of The Grapes of Wrath (1939), based on newspaper articles about migrant agricultural workers that he had written in San Francisco and Of Mice and Men (by two different movie studios) were in production simultaneously, allowing [0] to spend a full day on the set of The Grapes of Wrath (1939), based on newspaper articles about migrant agricultural workers that he had written in San Francisco and the next day on the set of Of Mice and Men.[citation needed]", "Ed Ricketts": "[0]  is our person to focus on. In the 1930s and 1940s, Ed Ricketts strongly influenced Steinbeck's writing. [0] frequently took small trips with Ed Ricketts along the California coast to give [0] time off from Steinbeck's writing and to collect biological specimens, which Ed Ricketts sold for a living. Their's coauthored book, Sea of Cortez (December 1941), about a collecting expedition to the Gulf of California in 1940, which was part travelogue and part natural history, published just as the U.S. entered World War II, never found an audience and did not sell well. However, in 1951, [0] republished the narrative portion of the book as The Log from the Sea of Cortez, under [0]'s name only (though Ed Ricketts had written some of the narrative portion of the book). The Log from the Sea of Cortez remains in print today.Although Carol accompanied [0] on a collecting expedition to the Gulf of California, Their's marriage was beginning to suffer, and ended a year later, in 1941, even as [0] worked on the manuscript for the book. In 1942, after [0]'s Carol [0] married Gwyndolyn \"Gwyn\" Conger.Ed Ricketts was [0]'s model for the character of \"Doc\" in Cannery Row (1945) and Sweet Thursday (1954), \"Friend Ed\" in Burning Bright, and characters in In Dubious Battle (1936) and The Grapes of Wrath (1939). Ecological themes recur in [0]'s novels of the period.[0]'s close relations with Ed Ricketts ended in 1941 when [0] moved away from Pacific Grove and divorced [0]'s . Ed Ricketts's biographer Eric Enno Tamm opined that, except for East of Eden (1952), Steinbeck's writing declined after Ed Ricketts's untimely death in 1948.", "World War II": "[0]  is our person to focus on. Steinbeck's novel The Moon Is Down (1942), about the Socrates-inspired spirit of resistance in an occupied village in Northern Europe, was made into a film almost immediately. It was presumed that the unnamed country of Steinbeck's novel The Moon Is Down (1942), about the Socrates-inspired spirit of resistance in an occupied village in Northern Europe, was Norway and the occupiers the Germans. In 1945, [0] received the King Haakon VII Freedom Cross for [0]'s literary contributions to the Norwegian resistance movement.In 1943, [0] served as a World War II war correspondent for the New York Herald Tribune and worked with the Office of Strategic Services (predecessor of the CIA). It was at that time [0] became friends with Will Lang Jr. of Time/Life magazine. During World War II, [0] accompanied the commando raids of Douglas Fairbanks Jr.'s's Beach Jumpers program, which launched small-unit diversion operations against German-held islands in the Mediterranean. At one point, [0] accompanied Douglas Fairbanks Jr.'s on an invasion of an island off the coast of Italy and used a Thompson submachine gun to help capture Italian and German prisoners. Some of [0]'s writings from this period were incorporated in the documentary Once There Was a War ([0] returned from World War II with a number of wounds from shrapnel and some psychological trauma. [0] treated [0], as ever, by writing. [0] wrote Alfred Hitchcock's movie, Lifeboat (1944), and with screenwriter Jack Wagner, A Medal for Benny (1945), about paisanos from Tortilla Flat going to war. [0] later requested that [0]'s name be removed from the credits of Alfred Hitchcock's movie, Lifeboat (1944), because [0] believed the final version of Alfred Hitchcock's movie, Lifeboat (1944) had racist undertones. In 1944, suffering from homesickness for [0]'s Pacific Grove/Monterey life of the 1930s, [0] wrote Cannery Row (1945), which became so famous that in 1958 Ocean View Avenue in Monterey, the setting of the book, was renamed Cannery RowCannery Row (1945), which became so famous that in 1958 Ocean View Avenue in Monterey, the setting of the book, was renamed Cannery Row.After World War II, [0] wrote The Pearl (1947), knowing The Pearl (1947) would be filmed eventually. The Pearl (1947) first appeared in the December 1945 issue of Woman's Home Companion magazine as \"The Pearl of the World\". The Pearl (1947) was illustrated by John Alan Maxwell. The Pearl (1947) is an imaginative telling of a story which [0] had heard in La Paz in 1940, as related in The Log From the Sea of Cortez, which [0] described in Chapter 11 as being \"so much like a parable that a parable almost can't be\". [0] traveled to Cuernavaca, Mexico for the filming with Wagner who helped with the script; on this trip [0] would be inspired by the story of Emiliano Zapata, and subsequently wrote a film script (Viva Zapata!) directed by Elia Kazan and starring Marlon Brando and Anthony Quinn.In 1947, [0] made [0]'s first trip to the Soviet Union with photographer Robert Capa. They visited Moscow, Kyiv, Tbilisi, Batumi and Stalingrad, some of the first Americans to visit many parts of the USSR since the communist revolution. Steinbeck's 1948 book about their experiences, A Russian Journal, was illustrated with photographer Robert Capa's photos. In 1948, the year Steinbeck's 1948 book about their experiences, A Russian Journal was published, [0] was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters.", "New York": "[0]  is our person to focus on. In 1952 Steinbeck's longest novel, East of Eden, was published. According to his third wife, Elaine, [0] considered Steinbeck's longest novel, East of Eden, [0]'s magnum opus, [0]'s greatest novel. Also in 1952, [0] appeared as the on-screen narrator of 20th Century Fox's film, O. Henry's Full House. Although [0] later admitted [0] was uncomfortable before the camera, [0] provided interesting introductions to several filmed adaptations of short stories by the legendary writer O. Henry. About the same time, [0] recorded readings of several of his short stories for Columbia Records;  readings of several of his short stories provide a record of [0]'s deep, resonant voice.Following the success of Viva Zapata!, [0] collaborated with Kazan on the 1955 film East of Eden, James Dean's movie debut.From March to October 1959, Steinbeck and his third wife Elaine rented a cottage in the hamlet of Discove, Redlynch, near Bruton in Somerset, England, while [0] researched his retelling of the Arthurian legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. Glastonbury Tor was visible from a cottage in the hamlet of Discove, Redlynch, near Bruton in Somerset, England, and [0] also visited the nearby hillfort of Cadbury Castle, the supposed site of King Arthur's court of Camelot. his retelling of the Arthurian legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table was published after his death in 1976, as The Acts of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. Steinbeck and his third wife Elaine recounted the time spent in Somerset, England as the happiest of Steinbeck and his third wife Elaine's life together.Travels with Charley: In Search of America is a travelogue of his 1960 road trip with his poodle Charley. [0] bemoans [0]'s lost youth and roots, while dispensing both criticism and praise for America. According to [0]'s son Thom, [0] made his 1960 road trip with his poodle Charley because [0] knew [0] was dying and wanted to see America one last time.Steinbeck's last novel, The Winter of Our Discontent (1961), examines moral decline in America. The protagonist Ethan grows discontented with The protagonist Ethan's own moral decline and that of those around The protagonist Ethan. Steinbeck's last novel, The Winter of Our Discontent (1961), has a very different tone from [0]'s amoral and ecological stance in earlier works such as Tortilla Flat and Cannery Row. Steinbeck's last novel, The Winter of Our Discontent (1961), was not a critical success. Many reviewers recognized the importance of Steinbeck's last novel, The Winter of Our Discontent (1961),, but were disappointed that Steinbeck's last novel, The Winter of Our Discontent (1961), was not another Grapes of Wrath.In the Nobel Prize presentation speech the next year, however, the Swedish Academy cited Steinbeck's last novel, The Winter of Our Discontent (1961), most favorably: \"Here [0] attained the same standard which [0] set in The Grapes of Wrath. Again [0] holds [0]'s position as an independent expounder of the truth with an unbiased instinct for what is genuinely American, be it good or bad.\"Apparently taken aback by the critical reception of Steinbeck's last novel, The Winter of Our Discontent (1961),, and the critical outcry when [0] was awarded Nobel Prize in 1962, [0] published no more fiction in the remaining six years before his death.", "Nobel Prize": "[0]  is our person to focus on. In 1962, [0] won the Nobel Prize for literature for his \"realistic and imaginative writing, combining as it does sympathetic humor and keen social perceptionhis \"realistic and imaginative writing, combining as it does sympathetic humor and keen social perception \". The selection was heavily criticized, and described as \"one of the Academy's biggest mistakes\" in one Swedish newspaper. The reaction of American literary critics was also harsh. The New York Times asked why the Nobel committee the Nobel Prize for literature gave the Nobel Prize for literature to an author whose \"limited talent is, in [0]'s best books, watered down by tenth-rate philosophising\", noting that \"he international character of the Nobel Prize for literature and the weight attached to the Nobel Prize for literature raise questions about the mechanics of selection and how close the Nobel committee the Nobel Prize for literature is to the main currents of American writing. ... The New York Times think it interesting that the Nobel Prize for literature was not awarded to a writer ... whose significance, influence and sheer body of work had already made a more profound impression on the literature of our age\". [0], when asked on the day of the announcement if [0] deserved the Nobel Prize for literature, replied: \"Frankly, no.\" Biographer Jackson Benson notes, \"[0]'s honor was one of the few in the world that one could not buy nor gain by political maneuver. It was precisely because the Nobel committee made the Nobel committee's judgment ... on the Nobel committee's own criteria, rather than plugging into 'the main currents of American writing' as defined by the critical establishment, that the Nobel Prize for literature had value.\" In [0]'s acceptance speech later in the year in Stockholm, [0] said:the writer is delegated to declare and to celebrate man's proven capacity for greatness of heart and spirit\u2014for gallantry in defeat, for courage, compassion and love. In the endless war against weakness and despair, man's proven capacity for greatness of heart and spirit\u2014for gallantry in defeat, for courage, compassion and love are the bright rally flags of hope and of emulation. [0] hold that a writer who does not believe in the perfectibility of man has no dedication nor any membership in literature. Fifty years later, in 2012, the Nobel Prize for literature opened the Nobel Prize for literature's archives and it was revealed that [0] was a \"compromise choice\" among a shortlist consisting of [0], British authors Robert Graves and Lawrence Durrell, French dramatist Jean Anouilh and Danish author Karen Blixen. The declassified documents showed that [0] was chosen as the best of a bad lot. \"There aren't any obvious candidates for the Nobel Prize for literature and the Nobel committee is in an unenviable situation,\" wrote committee member Henry Olsson. Although the Nobel committee believed [0]'s best work was behind [0] by 1962, committee member Anders \u00d6sterling believed the release of [0]'s novel The Winter of Our Discontent showed that \"after some signs of slowing down in recent years, [[0] has] regained [0]'s position as a social truth-teller [and is an] authentic realist fully equal to [0]'s predecessors Sinclair Lewis and Ernest Hemingway.\"Although modest about [0]'s own talent as a writer, [0] talked openly of [0]'s own admiration of certain writers. In 1953, [0] wrote that [0] considered cartoonist Al Capp, creator of the satirical Li'l Abner, \"possibly the best writer in the world today\". At [0]'s own first the Nobel Prize for literature press conference [0] was asked [0]'s favorite authors and works and replied: \"Ernest Hemingway's short stories and nearly everything Faulkner wrote.\"In September 1964, President Lyndon B.
