[0] (/\u02c8bi\u02d0\u0259tr\u026aks/, 28 July 1866\u00a0\u2013 22 December 1943) was an English writer, illustrator, natural scientist, and conservationist. [0] is best known for [0]'s children's books featuring animals, such as The Tale of Peter Rabbit, which was her first commercially published work in 1902. [0]'s books, including 23 Tales, have sold more than 250 million copies. An entrepreneur, [0] was a pioneer of character merchandising. In 1903, Peter Rabbit was the first fictional character to be made into a patented stuffed toy, making Peter Rabbit the oldest licensed character.Born into an upper-middle-class household, [0] was educated by governesses and grew up isolated from other children. [0] had numerous pets and spent holidays in Scotland and the Lake District, developing a love of landscape, flora and fauna, all of which [0] closely observed and painted. [0]'s study and watercolours of fungi led to [0] being widely respected in the field of mycology. In [0]'s thirties, [0] self-published The Tale of Peter Rabbit, which was her first commercially published work in 1902. Following published, [0] began writing and illustrating children's books full-time.[0] wrote over sixty books, with the best known being 23 Tales. With the proceeds from 23 Tales and a legacy from an aunt, in 1905 [0] bought Hill Top Farm in Near Sawrey, a village in the Lake District. Over the following decades, [0] purchased additional farms to preserve the unique hill country landscape. In 1913, at the age of 47, [0] married William Heelis, a respected local solicitor with an office in Hawkshead. [0] was also a prize-winning breeder of Herdwick sheep and a prosperous farmer keenly interested in land preservation. [0] continued to write and illustrate, and to design spin-off merchandise based on 23 Tales for British publisher Warne until the duties of land management and [0]'s diminishing eyesight made it difficult to continue.[0] died of pneumonia and heart disease on 22 December 1943 at [0]'s home in Near Sawrey, a village in the Lake District at the age of 77, leaving almost all [0]'s property to the National Trust. [0] is credited with preserving much of the land that now constitutes the Lake District National Park. 23 Tales continue to sell throughout the world in many languages with [0]'s stories being retold in songs, films, ballet, and animations, and [0]'s life is depicted in two films and a television series."}, "Biography": {"Early life": "[0] is our person to focus on. Potter's family on both sides were from the Manchester area. Potter's family on both sides were English Unitarians, associated with dissenting Protestant congregations, influential in 19th century England, that affirmed the oneness of God and that rejected the doctrine of the Trinity. [0]'s paternal grandfather, Edmund Potter, from Glossop in Derbyshire, owned what was then the largest calico printing works in 19th century England, and later served as a Member of Parliament.Potter's father, Rupert William Potter (1832\u20131914), was educated at Manchester College by the Unitarian philosopher James Martineau. Potter's father, Rupert William Potter (1832\u20131914), then trained as a barrister in London. Potter's father, Rupert William Potter (1832\u20131914), practised law, specialising in equity law and conveyancing. Potter's father, Rupert William Potter (1832\u20131914), married Helen Leech (1839\u20131932) on 8 August 1863 at Hyde Unitarian Chapel, Gee Cross. Helen Leech (1839\u20131932) was the daughter of Jane Ashton (1806\u20131884) and John Leech, a wealthy cotton merchant and shipbuilder from Stalybridge. Helen Leech (1839\u20131932)'s first cousins were siblings Harriet Lupton (n\u00e9e Ashton) and  Thomas Ashton, 1st Baron Ashton of Hyde. It was reported in July 2014 that [0] had personally given a number of [0]'s own original hand-painted illustrations to the two daughters of Arthur and Harriet Lupton, who were cousins to both [0] and Catherine, Princess of Wales.Potter's parents lived comfortably at 2 Bolton Gardens, West Brompton, London, where Helen Leech (1839\u20131932) was born on 28 July 1866 and Helen Leech (1839\u20131932)'s brother Walter Bertram on 14 March 1872. 2 Bolton Gardens, West Brompton, London was destroyed in the Blitz. Bousfield Primary School now stands where 2 Bolton Gardens, West Brompton, London once was. A blue plaque on the school building testifies to the former site of 2 Bolton Gardens, West Brompton, London. Potter's parents were artistically talented, and Potter's father, Rupert William Potter (1832\u20131914), was an adept amateur photographer. Potter's father, Rupert William Potter (1832\u20131914), had invested in the stock market, and by the early 1890s, Potter's father, Rupert William Potter (1832\u20131914), was extremely wealthy.[0] was educated by three governesses, the last of whom was Annie Moore (n\u00e9e Carter), just three years older than Potter, who tutored Potter in German as well as acting as lady's companion. Annie Moore (n\u00e9e Carter), just three years older than Potter, who tutored Potter in German as well as acting as lady's companion remained friends throughout Potter's parents's lives, and Annie Moore (n\u00e9e Carter), just three years older than Potter, who tutored Potter in German as well as acting as lady's companion's eight children were the recipients of many of Potter's picture letters. It was Annie Moore (n\u00e9e Carter), just three years older than Potter, who tutored Potter in German as well as acting as lady's companion who later suggested that Potter's picture letters might make good children's books.She and her younger brother Walter Bertram (1872\u20131918) grew up with few friends outside She and her younger brother Walter Bertram (1872\u20131918)'s large extended family. Potter's parents were artistic, interested in nature, and enjoyed the countryside. As children, She and her younger brother Walter Bertram (1872\u20131918) had numerous small animals as pets which She and her younger brother Walter Bertram (1872\u20131918) observed closely and drew endlessly. In She and her younger brother Walter Bertram (1872\u20131918)'s schoolroom, She and her younger brother Walter Bertram (1872\u20131918) kept a variety of small pets\u2014mice, rabbits, a hedgehog and some bats, along with collections of butterflies and other insects\u2014which She and her younger brother Walter Bertram (1872\u20131918) drew and studied. [0] was devoted to the care of numerous small animals, often taking numerous small animals with [0] on long holidays. In most of the first fifteen years of her life, [0] spent summer holidays at Dalguise, an estate on the River Tay in Perthshire, Scotland. There [0] sketched and explored an area that nourished [0]'s imagination and [0]'s observation. [0]'s first sketchbook from summer holidays, kept at age 8, and dated 1875, is held at and has been digitised by the Victoria & Albert Museum, London. She and her younger brother Walter Bertram (1872\u20131918) were allowed great freedom in Scotland, and She and her younger brother Walter Bertram (1872\u20131918) became adept students of natural history. In 1882, when Dalguise, an estate on the River Tay in Perthshire, Scotland was no longer available, She and her younger brother Walter Bertram (1872\u20131918) took She and her younger brother Walter Bertram (1872\u20131918)'s first summer holiday in the Lake District, at Wray Castle near Lake Windermere. Here [0] met Hardwicke Rawnsley, vicar of Wray and later the founding secretary of the National Trust, whose interest in the countryside and country life inspired the same in [0] and who was to have a lasting impact on her life.At about the age of 14, [0] began to keep a diary, written in a simple substitution cipher of her own devising. a diary, written in a simple substitution cipher of her own devising was important to the development of [0]'s creativity, serving as both sketchbook and literary experiment. In tiny handwriting, [0] reported on society, recorded [0]'s impressions of art and artists, recounted stories and observed life around [0]. a diary, written in a simple substitution cipher of her own devising does not provide an intimate record of [0]'s personal life, but a diary, written in a simple substitution cipher of her own devising is an invaluable source for understanding a vibrant part of British society in the late 19th century. a diary, written in a simple substitution cipher of her own devising describes [0]'s maturing artistic and intellectual interests, [0]'s often amusing insights into the places [0] visited, and [0]'s unusual ability to observe nature and to describe nature. Started in 1881, a diary, written in a simple substitution cipher of her own devising ends in 1897 when [0]'s artistic and intellectual energies were absorbed in scientific study and in efforts to publish [0]'s drawings. Precocious but reserved and often bored, [0] was searching for more independent activities and wished to earn some money of [0]'s own while dutifully taking care of Potter's parents, dealing with [0] especially demanding mother, and managing Potter's parents's various households.", "Scientific illustrations and work in mycology": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0]'s parents did not discourage higher education. As was common in the Victorian era, women of [0]'s class were privately educated and rarely went to university.[0] was interested in every branch of natural science except astronomy. Botany was a passion for most Victorians and nature study was a popular enthusiasm. [0] collected fossils, studied archaeological artefacts from London excavations, and was interested in entomology. In all these areas, [0] drew and painted [0]'s specimens with increasing skill. By the 1890s, her scientific interests centred on mycology. First drawn to fungi because of fungi's colours and evanescence in nature and [0]'s delight in painting fungi, her scientific interests deepened after meeting Charles McIntosh, a revered naturalist and amateur mycologist, during a summer holiday in Dunkeld in Perthshire in 1892. Charles McIntosh, a revered naturalist and amateur mycologist, helped improve the accuracy of [0]'s illustrations, taught [0]'s taxonomy, and supplied [0] with live specimens to paint during the winter. Curious as to how fungi reproduced, [0] began microscopic drawings of fungus spores (the agarics) and in 1895 developed a theory of fungus spores (the agarics)'s germination. Through the connections of [0]'s uncle Sir Henry Enfield Roscoe, a chemist and vice-chancellor of the University of London, [0] consulted with botanists at Kew Gardens, convincing George Massee of [0]'s ability to germinate spores and [0]'s theory of hybridisation. [0] did not believe in the theory of symbiosis proposed by Simon Schwendener, the German mycologist, as previously thought; instead, [0] proposed a more independent process of reproduction.Rebuffed by William Thiselton-Dyer, the Director at Kew Gardens, because of [0]'s sex and [0]'s amateur status, [0] wrote up [0]'s conclusions and submitted a paper, On the Germination of the Spores of the Agaricineae, to the Linnean Society in 1897. a paper, On the Germination of the Spores of the Agaricineae, was introduced by George Massee because, as a woman, [0] could not attend proceedings or read a paper, On the Germination of the Spores of the Agaricineae,. [0] subsequently withdrew a paper, On the Germination of the Spores of the Agaricineae,, realising that some of [0]'s samples were contaminated, but continued [0]'s microscopic studies for several more years. a paper, On the Germination of the Spores of the Agaricineae, has only recently been rediscovered[citation needed], along with the rich, artistic illustrations and drawings that accompanied a paper, On the Germination of the Spores of the Agaricineae,. [0]'s work is only now being properly evaluated. [0] later gave her other mycological and scientific drawings to the Armitt Museum and Library in Ambleside, where mycologists still refer to her other mycological and scientific drawings to identify fungi. There is also a collection of [0]'s fungus paintings at the Perth Museum and Art Gallery in Perth, Scotland, donated by Charles McIntosh, a revered naturalist and amateur mycologist,. In 1967, the mycologist W. P. K. Findlay included many of Potter's beautifully accurate fungus drawings in the mycologist W. P. K. Findlay's Wayside & Woodland Fungi, thereby fulfilling [0]'s desire to one day have Potter's beautifully accurate fungus drawings published in a book. In 1997, the Linnean Society issued a posthumous apology to [0] for the sexism displayed in the Linnean Society's handling of [0]'s research.", "Artistic and literary career": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0]'s artistic and literary interests were deeply influenced by fairy tales and fantasy. [0] was a student of the classic fairy tales of Western Europe. As well as stories from the Old Testament, John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress and Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin, [0] grew up with Aesop's Fables, the fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm and Hans Christian Andersen, Charles Kingsley's The Water Babies, the folk tales and mythology of Scotland, the German Romantics, Shakespeare, and the romances of Sir Walter Scott. As a young child, before the age of eight, Edward Lear's A Book of Nonsense, including the much loved The Owl and the Pussycat, and Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland had made Edward Lear's A Book of Nonsense, including the much loved The Owl and the Pussycat, and Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland's impression, although [0] later said of Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland that [0] was more interested in Tenniel's illustrations than what Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland were about.The Brer Rabbit stories of Joel Chandler Harris had been family favourites, and [0] later studied his Uncle Remus stories and illustrated his Uncle Remus stories. [0] studied book illustration from a young age and developed [0]'s own tastes, but the work of the picture book triumvirate Walter Crane, Kate Greenaway and Randolph Caldecott, the last an illustrator whose work was later collected by her father, was a great influence. When [0] started to illustrate, [0] chose first the traditional rhymes and stories, \"Cinderella\", \"Sleeping Beauty\", \"Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves\", \"Puss-in-boots\", and \"Red Riding Hood\". However, most often [0]'s illustrations were fantasies featuring [0]'s own pets: mice, rabbits, kittens, and guinea pigs.In [0]'s teenage years, [0] was a regular visitor to the art galleries of London, particularly enjoying the summer and winter exhibitions at the Royal Academy in London. [0]'s Journal reveals [0]'s growing sophistication as a critic as well as the influence of her father's friend, the artist Sir John Everett Millais, who recognised [0]'s talent of observation. Although [0] was aware of art and artistic trends, [0]'s drawing and [0]'s prose style were uniquely [0]'s own.As a way to earn money in the 1890s, [0] printed Christmas cards of [0]'s own design, as well as cards for special occasions. printed were [0]'s first commercially successful works as an illustrator. Mice and rabbits were the most frequent subject of [0]'s fantasy paintings. In 1890, the firm of Hildesheimer and Faulkner bought several of the drawings of [0]'s rabbit Benjamin Bunny to illustrate verses by Frederic Weatherly titled A Happy Pair. In 1893, the firm of Hildesheimer and Faulkner bought several more drawings for Frederic Weatherly's Our Dear Relations, another book of rhymes, and the following year [0] sold a series of frog illustrations and verses for Changing Pictures, a popular annual offered by the art publisher Ernest Nister. [0] was pleased by this success and determined to publish her own illustrated stories.Whenever [0] went on holiday to the Lake District or Scotland, [0] sent letters to young friends, illustrating letters with quick sketches. Many of letters were written to the children of her former governess Annie Carter Moore, particularly to Moore's eldest son Noel, who was often ill. In September 1893, [0] was on holiday at Eastwood in Dunkeld, Perthshire. [0] had run out of things to say to Moore's eldest son Noel, who was often ill, and so [0] told Moore's eldest son Noel, who was often ill a story about \"four little rabbits whose names were Flopsy, Mopsy, Cottontail and Peter\". a story about \"four little rabbits whose names were Flopsy, Mopsy, Cottontail and Peter became one of the most famous children's letters ever written and the basis of [0]'s future career as a writer-artist-storyteller.In 1900, [0] revised a story about \"four little rabbits whose names were Flopsy, Mopsy, Cottontail and Peter\", and fashioned a dummy book of a story about \"four little rabbits whose names were Flopsy, Mopsy, Cottontail and Peter\" \u2013 it has been suggested, in imitation of Helen Bannerman's 1899 bestseller The Story of Little Black Sambo. Unable to find a buyer for a story about \"four little rabbits whose names were Flopsy, Mopsy, Cottontail and Peter\", [0] published a dummy book for family and friends at [0]'s own expense in December 1901. a dummy book was drawn in black and white with a coloured frontispiece. Rawnsley had great faith in a story about \"four little rabbits whose names were Flopsy, Mopsy, Cottontail and Peter\", recast a story about \"four little rabbits whose names were Flopsy, Mopsy, Cottontail and Peter\" in didactic verse, and made the rounds of the London publishing houses. Frederick Warne & Co had previously rejected a story about \"four little rabbits whose names were Flopsy, Mopsy, Cottontail and Peter\" but, eager to compete in the booming small format children's book market, reconsidered and accepted a dummy book Frederick Warne & Co a dummy bookfollowing the recommendation of Frederick Warne & Co's prominent children's book artist L. Leslie Brooke. Frederick Warne & Co declined Rawnsley's verse in favour of [0]'s original prose, and [0] agreed to colour [0]'s pen and ink illustrations, choosing the new Hentschel three-colour process to reproduce [0]'s watercolours.On 2 October 1902, a story about \"four little rabbits whose names were Flopsy, Mopsy, Cottontail and Peter\" was published and was an immediate success. a story about \"four little rabbits whose names were Flopsy, Mopsy, Cottontail and Peter\" was followed the next year by The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin and The Tailor of Gloucester, which had also first been written as picture letters to the Moore children. Working with Norman Warne as [0]'s editor, [0] published two or three little books each year: 23 books in all. The last book in published was Cecily Parsley's Nursery Rhymes in 1922, a collection of favourite rhymes. Although The Tale of Little Pig Robinson was not published until 1930, The Tale of Little Pig Robinson had been written much earlier. [0] continued creating [0]'s little books until after the First World War when [0]'s energies were increasingly directed toward [0]'s farming, sheep-breeding and land conservation.The immense popularity of [0]'s books was based on the lively quality of [0]'s illustrations, the non-didactic nature of her own illustrated stories, the depiction of the rural countryside, and the imaginative qualities [0] lent to [0]'s animal characters.[0] was also a canny businesswoman. As early as 1903, [0] made and patented a Peter Rabbit doll. a Peter Rabbit doll was followed by other \"spin-off\" merchandise over the years, including painting books, board games, wall-paper, figurines, baby blankets and china tea-sets. All were licensed by Frederick Warne & Co and earned [0] an independent income, as well as immense profits for Frederick Warne & Co.In 1905, Potter and Norman Warne became unofficially engaged. [0]'s parents objected to the match because Norman Warne was \"in trade\" and thus not socially suitable. the match lasted only one month\u2014Norman Warne died of pernicious anaemia at age 37. 1905, [0] used some of [0]'s income and a small inheritance from an aunt to buy Hill Top Farm in Near Sawrey in the English Lake District near Windermere. Potter and Norman Warne may have hoped that Hill Top Farm in Near Sawrey in the English Lake District near Windermere would be Potter and Norman Warne's holiday home, but after Norman Warne's , [0] went ahead with Hill Top Farm in Near Sawrey in the English Lake District near Windermere's purchase as [0] had always wanted to own Hill Top Farm in Near Sawrey in the English Lake District near Windermere and live in \"Hill Top Farm in Near Sawrey in the English Lake District near Windermere\".", "Country life and marriage": "Beatrix Potter is our person to focus on. [0] and [0]'s family agreed to stay on to manage the farm for Beatrix Potter while Beatrix Potter made physical improvements and learned the techniques of fell farming and of raising livestock, including pigs, cows and chickens; the following year Beatrix Potter added sheep. Realising Beatrix Potter needed to protect Beatrix Potter's boundaries, Beatrix Potter sought advice from W.H. Heelis & Son, a local firm of solicitors with offices in nearby Hawkshead. With William Heelis acting for Beatrix Potter, Beatrix Potter bought contiguous pasture, and in 1909 the 20 acres (8.1\u00a0ha) Castle Farm across the road from the farm. Beatrix Potter visited the farm at every opportunity, and Beatrix Potter's books written during this period (such as The Tale of Ginger and Pickles, about the local shop in Near Sawrey and The Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse, a wood mouse) reflect Beatrix Potter's increasing participation in village life and Beatrix Potter's delight in country living.Owning and managing these working farms required routine collaboration with William Heelis. By the summer of 1912, William Heelis had proposed marriage and Beatrix Potter had accepted; although Beatrix Potter did not immediately tell Beatrix Potter's parents, who once again disapproved because William Heelis was only a country solicitor. Potter and Heelis were married on 15 October 1913 in London at St Mary Abbots in Kensington. Potter and Heelis moved immediately to Near Sawrey, residing at Castle Cottage, the renovated farmhouse on Castle Farm, which was 34 acres large. the farm remained a working farm but was now remodelled to allow for the tenant family and Beatrix Potter's private studio and workshop. At last Beatrix Potter's own woman, Beatrix Potter settled into the partnerships that shaped the rest of Beatrix Potter's life: William Heelis and William Heelis's large family, Beatrix Potter's farms, the Near Sawrey community and the predictable rounds of country life. The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck and The Tale of Tom Kitten are representative of the farm and Beatrix Potter's farming life and reflect Beatrix Potter's happiness with Beatrix Potter's country life.Rupert Potter died in 1914 and, with the outbreak of World War I, Beatrix Potter, persuaded Beatrix Potter's mother to move to the Lake District and found a property for Beatrix Potter to rent in Near Sawrey. Finding life in Near Sawrey dull, Beatrix Potter soon moved to Lindeth Howe (now a 34-bedroomed hotel), a large house the Potters had previously rented for the summer in Bowness, on the other side of Lake Windermere. Beatrix Potter continued to write stories for Frederick Warne & Co and fully participated in country life. Beatrix Potter established a Nursing Trust for local villages and served on various committees and councils responsible for footpaths and other rural issues.", "Sheep farming": "[0] is our person to focus on. Soon after acquiring Hill Top Farm, [0] became keenly interested in the breeding and raising of Herdwick sheep, the indigenous fell sheep. In 1923 [0] bought a large sheep farm in the Troutbeck Valley called Troutbeck Park Farm, formerly a deer park, restoring a large sheep farm in the Troutbeck Valley called Troutbeck Park Farm, formerly a deer park's land with thousands of Herdwick sheep. bought established [0] as one of the major Herdwick sheep farmers in the county. [0] was admired by [0]'s shepherds and farm managers for [0]'s willingness to experiment with the latest biological remedies for the common diseases of sheep, and for [0]'s employment of the best shepherds, sheep breeders, and farm managers.By the late 1920s, Potter and her Hill Top farm manager Tom Storey had made a name for Potter and her Hill Top farm manager Tom Storey's prize-winning Herdwick flock, which took many prizes at the local agricultural shows, where [0] was often asked to serve as a judge. In 1942 [0] became President-elect of the Herdwick Sheepbreeders' Association, the first time a woman had been elected, but died before taking office.", "Welsh language": "[0] is our person to focus on. In one of [0]'s diary entries whilst travelling through Wales, [0] complained about the Welsh language. [0] wrote \"Machynlleth, wretched town, hardly a person could speak English\", continuing \"Welsh seem a pleasant intelligent race, but [0] should think awkward to live with... the Welsh language is past description.\"", "": ""}, "Lake District conservation": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] had been a disciple of the land conservation and preservation ideals of [0]'s long-time friend and mentor, Canon Hardwicke Rawnsley, the first secretary and founding member of the National Trust. According to the National Trust, \"[0] supported the efforts of the National Trust to preserve not just the places of extraordinary beauty but also those heads of valleys and low grazing lands that would be irreparably ruined by development.\" [0] was also an authority on the traditional Lakeland crafts and period furniture, as well as local stonework. [0] restored and preserved the farms that [0] bought or managed, making sure that each farm house had in each farm house a piece of antique Lakeland furniture. [0] was interested in preserving not only the Herdwick sheep but also the way of life of fell farming. In 1930 the Heelises became partners with the National Trust in buying and managing the fell farms included in the large Monk Coniston Estate.the large Monk Coniston Estate was composed of many farms spread over a wide area of north-western Lancashire, including the Tarn Hows. [0] was the de facto estate manager for the National Trust for seven years until the National Trust could afford to repurchase most of the large Monk Coniston Estate from [0]. [0]'s stewardship of the fell farms included in the large Monk Coniston Estate earned [0]'s full regard, but [0] was not without [0]'s critics, not the least of which were [0]'s contemporaries who felt [0] used [0]'s wealth and the position of [0]'s husband to acquire properties in advance of properties's being made public. [0] was notable in observing the problems of afforestation, preserving the intact grazing lands, and husbanding the quarries and timber on the fell farms included in the large Monk Coniston Estate. the fell farms included in the large Monk Coniston Estate were stocked with Herdwick sheep and frequently with Galloway cattle."}, "Later life": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] continued to write stories and to draw, although mostly for [0]'s own pleasure. In 1922,  Cecily Parsley's Nursery Rhymes, a collection of traditional English nursery rhymes, was published. [0]'s books in the late 1920s included the semi-autobiographical The Fairy Caravan, a fanciful tale set in her beloved Troutbeck fells. the semi-autobiographical The Fairy Caravan, a fanciful tale set in her beloved Troutbeck fells was published only in the US during [0]'s lifetime, and not until 1952 in the UK. Sister Anne, [0]'s version of the story of Bluebeard, was written for [0]'s American readers, but illustrated by Katharine Sturges. A final folktale, Wag by Wall, was published posthumously by The Horn Book Magazine in 1944. [0] was a generous patron of the Girl Guides, whose troupes she allowed to make their summer encampments on her land, and whose company she enjoyed as an older womanthe Girl Guides, whose troupes she allowed to make their summer encampments on her land, and whose company she enjoyed as an older woman's .Potter and William Heelis enjoyed a happy marriage of thirty years, continuing Potter and William Heelis's farming and preservation efforts throughout the hard days of World War II. Although Potter and William Heelis were childless, [0] played an important role in William Heelis's large family, particularly enjoying [0]'s relationship with several nieces whom [0] helped educate, and giving comfort and aid to William Heelis's brothers and sisters.[0] died of complications from pneumonia and heart disease on 22 December 1943 at Castle Cottage, and [0]'s remains were cremated at Carleton Crematorium, Blackpool. [0] left nearly all [0]'s property to the National Trust, including over 4,000 acres (16\u00a0km2) of land, sixteen farms, cottages and herds of cattle and Herdwick sheep. [0] was the largest gift at that time to the National Trust, and [0] enabled the preservation of the land now included in the Lake District National Park and the continuation of fell farming. The central office of the National Trust in Swindon was named \"Heelis\" in 2005 in [0]'s memory. William Heelis continued William Heelis's stewardship of Potter and William Heelis's properties and of [0]'s literary and artistic work for the twenty months William Heelis survived [0]. When William Heelis died in August 1945, William Heelis left the remainder to the National Trust."}, "Legacy": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] left almost all the original illustrations for [0]'s books to the National Trust. The copyright to her stories and merchandise was then given to [0]'s publisher Frederick Warne & Co, now a division of the Penguin Group. On 1 January 2014, The copyright to her stories and merchandise expired in the UK and other countries with a 70-years-after-death limit. Hill Top Farm was opened to the public by the National Trust in 1946; her artwork was displayed there until 1985 when her artwork was moved to William Heelis's former law offices in Hawkshead, also owned by the National Trust as the Beatrix Potter Gallery.[0] gave [0]'s folios of mycological drawings to the Armitt Library and Museum in Ambleside before [0]'s death. The Tale of Peter Rabbit is owned by Warne, The Tailor of Gloucester by the Tate Gallery, and The Tale of the Flopsy Bunnies by the British Museum.[0] was the first to recognise that content\u2014as we now call the stuff that makes up a book or a film\u2014was only the beginning. In 1903, Peter Rabbit hopped outside Peter Rabbit's pages to become a patented soft toy, which gave Peter Rabbit the distinction of being not only Mr. McGregor\u2018s mortal enemy, but also becoming the first licensed character. In 1903, [0] created the first Peter Rabbit soft toy and registered Peter Rabbit at the Patent Office in London, making Peter Rabbit the oldest licensed fictional character. Merchandise of Peter and other Potter characters have been sold at Harrods department store in London since at least 1910 when the range first appeared in Harrods department store in London's catalogues. Along with [0]'s writing [0] would continue to oversee merchandising and licensing opportunities for Peter and other Potter characters. On [0]'s legacy, Nicholas Tucker in The Guardian writes, \"[0] was the first author to license fictional characters to a range of toys and household objects still on sale today\". In an article by the Smithsonian magazine titled,  How [0] Invented Character Merchandising, Joy Lanzendorfer writes, \"[0] was also an entrepreneur and a pioneer in licensing and merchandising literary characters. [0] built a retail empire out of [0]'s \u201cbunny book\u201d that is worth $500 million today. In the process, [0] created a system that continues to benefit all licensed characters, from Mickey Mouse to Harry Potter.\"The largest public collection of [0]'s letters and drawings is the Leslie Linder Bequest and Leslie Linder Collection at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.
