After her father's death in 1904, the Stephen family moved from South Kensington, London to the more artistically bohemian Bloomsbury, where, in conjunction with the brothers' intellectual friends, the Stephen family formed the artistic and literary Bloomsbury Group. In 1912, [0] married Leonard Woolf, and in 1917, the couple founded the Hogarth Press, which published much of her work. the couple rented a home in Sussex and later moved there permanently in 1940. [0] had romantic relationships with women. One female lover was Vita Sackville-West, whose books [0] had published through the Hogarth Press, which published much of her work. Both women's's literature became inspired by Both women's's relationship, which lasted until [0]'s death.During the inter-war period, [0] was an important part of London's literary and artistic society. In 1915, [0] published [0]'s first novel, The Voyage Out, through [0]'s half-brother's publishing house, Gerald Duckworth and Company.

[0] was born Adeline Virginia Stephen on 25 January 1882 at 22 Hyde Park Gate in South Kensington, London, to Julia (n\u00e9e Jackson) (1846\u20131895) and Sir Leslie Stephen (1832\u20131904), writer, historian, essayist, biographer, and mountaineer. Julia (n\u00e9e Jackson) (1846\u20131895) was born in 1846 in Calcutta, British India, to John Jackson and Maria \"Mia\" Theodosia Pattle, from two Anglo-Indian families. John Jackson was the third son of George Jackson and Mary Howard of Bengal, a physician who spent 25 years with the Bengal Medical Service and East India Company and a professor at the fledgling Calcutta Medical College. While John Jackson was an almost invisible presence, the Pattle family were famous beauties, and moved in the upper circles of Bengal society. The seven Pattle sisters married into important families. Julia Margaret Cameron was a celebrated photographer, while Virginia married Earl Somers, and their daughter, Julia (n\u00e9e Jackson) (1846\u20131895)'s cousin, was Lady Henry Somerset, the temperance leader. Julia (n\u00e9e Jackson) (1846\u20131895) moved to England with Julia (n\u00e9e Jackson) (1846\u20131895)'s at the age of two and spent much of Julia (n\u00e9e Jackson) (1846\u20131895)'s early life with another of her mother's sisters, Sarah Monckton Pattle. another of her mother's sisters, Sarah Monckton Pattle and another of her mother's sisters, Sarah Monckton Pattle's husband Henry Thoby Prinsep, conducted an artistic and literary salon at Little Holland House where Julia (n\u00e9e Jackson) (1846\u20131895) came into contact with a number of Pre-Raphaelite painters such as Edward Burne-Jones, for whom Julia (n\u00e9e Jackson) (1846\u20131895) modelled.Julia (n\u00e9e Jackson) (1846\u20131895) was the youngest of three sisters, and Adeline Virginia Stephen was named after her mother's eldest sister Adeline Maria Jackson (1837\u20131881) and Julia (n\u00e9e Jackson) (1846\u20131895)'s (see Pattle family tree). Because of the tragedy of her mother's eldest sister Adeline Maria Jackson (1837\u20131881)'s death the previous year, the Pattle family never used Adeline Virginia Stephen's first name. the Pattle family were a well educated, literary and artistic proconsular middle-class family. In 1867, Julia (n\u00e9e Jackson) (1846\u20131895) married Herbert Duckworth, a barrister, but within three years was left a widow with three infant children. Julia (n\u00e9e Jackson) (1846\u20131895) was devastated and entered a prolonged period of mourning, abandoning Julia (n\u00e9e Jackson) (1846\u20131895)'s faith and turning to nursing and philanthropy. Julia (n\u00e9e Jackson) (1846\u20131895) Herbert Duckworth, a barrister had three children:Leslie Stephen was born in 1832 in South Kensington to Sir James and Lady Jane Catherine Stephen (n\u00e9e Venn), daughter of John Venn, rector of Clapham. the Pattle family were the centre of the evangelical Clapham Sect. Sir James was the under secretary at the Colonial Office, and with another Clapham member, William Wilberforce, was responsible for the passage of the Slavery Abolition Bill in 1833. In 1849 Sir James was appointed Regius Professor of Modern History at the University of Cambridge. As a family of educators, lawyers, and writers the Pattle family represented the elite intellectual aristocracy. While the Pattle family were distinguished and intellectual, the Pattle family were less colourful and aristocratic than Julia (n\u00e9e Jackson) (1846\u20131895)'s. A graduate and fellow of the University of Cambridge Leslie Stephen renounced Leslie Stephen's faith and position to move to London where Leslie Stephen became a notable man of letters. In addition, Leslie Stephen was a rambler and mountaineer, described as a \"gaunt figure with the ragged red brown beard...a formidable man, with an immensely high forehead, steely-blue eyes, and a long pointed nose.\" In the same year as Julia (n\u00e9e Jackson) (1846\u20131895)'s marriage, Leslie Stephen wed Harriet Marian (Minny) Thackeray (1840\u20131875), youngest daughter of William Makepeace Thackeray, who bore him a daughter, Laura (1870\u20131945), but died in childbirth in 1875. a daughter, Laura (1870\u20131945) was developmentally disabled and eventually institutionalized.Julia (n\u00e9e Jackson) (1846\u20131895) knew Leslie Stephen through Julia (n\u00e9e Jackson) (1846\u20131895)'s friendship with Harriet Marian (Minny) Thackeray (1840\u20131875), youngest daughter of William Makepeace Thackeray, who bore him a daughter, Laura (1870\u20131945)'s elder sister Anne (Anny) Isabella Ritchie and had developed an interest in Leslie Stephen's agnostic writings. Julia (n\u00e9e Jackson) (1846\u20131895) was present the night Harriet Marian (Minny) Thackeray (1840\u20131875), youngest daughter of William Makepeace Thackeray, who bore him a daughter, Laura (1870\u20131945) died and later, tended to Leslie Stephen and helped Leslie Stephen move next door to Julia (n\u00e9e Jackson) (1846\u20131895) on Hyde Park Gate so a daughter, Laura (1870\u20131945) could have some companionship with a daughter, Laura (1870\u20131945)'s own children. Julia and Herbert Duckworth were preoccupied with mourning and although Julia and Herbert Duckworth developed a close friendship and intense correspondence, agreed a close friendship and intense correspondence would go no further. Leslie Stephen proposed to Julia (n\u00e9e Jackson) (1846\u20131895) in 1877, an offer Julia (n\u00e9e Jackson) (1846\u20131895) declined, but when Julia (n\u00e9e Jackson) (1846\u20131895) married later that year Julia (n\u00e9e Jackson) (1846\u20131895) accepted Leslie Stephen and Julia and Herbert Duckworth were married on 26 March 1878. Julia and Herbert Duckworth a daughter, Laura (1870\u20131945) then moved next door into Julia (n\u00e9e Jackson) (1846\u20131895)'s house, where Julia and Herbert Duckworth lived till Leslie Stephen's death in 1904. Julia (n\u00e9e Jackson) (1846\u20131895) was 32 and Leslie Stephen was 46.Their first child, Vanessa, was born on 30 May 1879. Julia (n\u00e9e Jackson) (1846\u20131895), having presented Julia (n\u00e9e Jackson) (1846\u20131895)'s with a child and now having five children to care for, decided to limit Julia (n\u00e9e Jackson) (1846\u20131895)'s growth. However, despite the fact that Julia and Herbert Duckworth took \"precautions,\" \"contraception was a very imperfect art in the nineteenth century:\" contraception resulted in the birth of three more children over the next four years.", "22 Hyde Park Gate (1882\u20131904)": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] provides insight into her early life in [0]'s autobiographical essays, including Reminiscences (1908), 22 Hyde Park Gate (1921), and A Sketch of the Past (1940). Other essays that provide insight into her early life include Leslie Stephen (1932). [0] also alludes to [0]'s childhood in [0]'s fictional writing. In To the Lighthouse (1927), [0]'s depiction of the life of the Ramsays in the Hebrides is an only thinly disguised account of the Stephens in Cornwall and the Godrevy Lighthouse the Stephens in Cornwall would visit there. However, [0]'s understanding of her mother and family evolved considerably between 1907 and 1940, in which her mother her mother becomes more nuanced and filled in.In February 1891, with her sister Vanessa, [0] began the Hyde Park Gate News, chronicling life and events within the Stephen family, and modelled on the popular magazine Tit-Bits. Initially, the Hyde Park Gate News, chronicling life and events within the Stephen family, and modelled on the popular magazine Tit-Bits was mainly her sister Vanessa's and Thoby's's articles, but very soon [0] became the main contributor, with her sister Vanessa as editor. her mother's response when the Hyde Park Gate News, chronicling life and events within the Stephen family, and modelled on the popular magazine Tit-Bits first appeared was \"Rather clever her mother think.\" [0] would run the Hyde Park Gate News, chronicling life and events within the Stephen family, and modelled on the popular magazine Tit-Bits until 1895, the time of her mother's death. The following year Their also used photography to supplement Their's insights, as did Stella Duckworth. her sister Vanessa's 1892 portrait of her sister Vanessa's sister and parents in the Library at Talland House (see image) was one of the Stephen family's favourites and was written about lovingly in Leslie Stephen (1932)'s memoir. In 1897 (\"the first really lived year of [0]'s life)\" [0] began [0]'s first diary, which [0] kept for the next twelve years, and a notebook in [0] was, as [0] describes it, \"born into a large connection, born not of rich parents, but of well-to-do parents, born into a very communicative, literate, letter writing, visiting, articulate, late nineteenth century world.\" a large connection was a well-connected family consisting of six children, with two half brothers and a half sister (the Duckworths, from her mother's first marriage), another half sister, Laura (from her father's's first marriage), and an older sister, Vanessa, and brother Thoby. The following year, another brother Adrian followed. The disabled Laura Stephen lived with the Stephen family until The disabled Laura Stephen was institutionalized in 1891. [0] Leslie Stephen (1932) had four children together:[0] was born at 22 Hyde Park Gate and lived there until her father's's death in 1904. Number 22 Hyde Park Gate, South Kensington, lay at the south-east end of Hyde Park Gate, a narrow cul-de-sac running south from Kensington Road, just west of the Royal Albert Hall, and opposite Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park, where the Stephen family regularly took the Stephen family's walks (see Map; Street plan). Built in 1846 by Henry Payne of Hammersmith as one of a row of single-family townhouses for the upper middle class, Number 22 Hyde Park Gate, South Kensington, soon became too small for the Stephen family. At the time of their's marriage, Number 22 Hyde Park Gate, South Kensington, consisted of a basement, two storeys, and an attic. In July 1886 Leslie Stephen (1932) obtained the services of J.\u00a0W. Penfold, an architect, to add additional living space above and behind Number 22 Hyde Park Gate, South Kensington,. add added a new top floor (see image of red brick extension), with three bedrooms and a study for Leslie Stephen (1932), converted an attic into rooms, and added the first bathroom. Number 22 Hyde Park Gate, South Kensington, was a tall but narrow townhouse, that at that time had no running water. [0] would later describe Number 22 Hyde Park Gate, South Kensington, as \"a very tall house on the left-hand side near the bottom which begins by being stucco and ends by being red brick; which is so high and yet\u2014as [0] can say now that the Stephen family have sold Number 22 Hyde Park Gate, South Kensington,\u2014so rickety that it seems as if a very high wind would topple Number 22 Hyde Park Gate, South Kensington, over.\"The servants worked \"downstairs\" in a basement. The ground floor had a drawing room, separated by a curtain from the servant's pantry and a library. Above a drawing room, separated by a curtain from the servant's pantry on the first floor were Their's bedrooms. On the next floor were the Duckworth children's rooms, and above the Duckworth children's rooms, the day and night nurseries of the Stephen family occupied two further floors. Finally, in the attic, under the eaves, were \"The servants's bedrooms, accessed by a back staircase. Life at 22 Hyde Park Gate was also divided symbolically; as [0] put it, \"The division in our lives was curious. Downstairs there was pure convention: upstairs pure intellect. But there was no connection between them,\" the worlds typified by Stella Duckworth and Leslie Stephen (1932). the Stephen family's , it seems, was the only one who could span this divide. Number 22 Hyde Park Gate, South Kensington, was described as dimly lit and crowded with furniture and paintings. Within Number 22 Hyde Park Gate, South Kensington,, the Stephen family formed a close-knit group. Despite formed, the Stephen family still held the Stephen family's grievances. [0] envied another brother Adrian for being the Stephen family's favourite. [0] status as creatives (writing and art respectively) caused a rivalry between Their at times. Life in London differed sharply from Their's summers in Cornwall, Their's outdoor activities consisting mainly of walks in nearby Kensington Gardens, where Their would play hide-and-seek and sail Their's boats on the Round Pond, while indoors, Life in London revolved around Their's lessons.Leslie Stephen (1932)'s eminence as an editor, critic, and biographer, and Leslie Stephen (1932)'s connection to William Thackeray, meant Leslie Stephen (1932)'s were raised in an environment filled with the influences of a Victorian literary society. Henry James, George Henry Lewes, Alfred Lord Tennyson, Thomas Hardy, Edward Burne-Jones, and [0]'s honorary godfather, James Russell Lowell, were among the visitors to Number 22 Hyde Park Gate, South Kensington,. Julia Stephen was equally well connected. Julia Stephen's aunt was a pioneering early photographer, Julia Margaret Cameron, who was also a visitor to the Stephen household. The two Stephen sisters, Vanessa and Virginia, were almost three years apart in age. [0] christened her sister Vanessa \"the saint\" and was far more inclined to exhibit [0]'s cleverness than her sister Vanessa. [0] resented the domesticity Victorian tradition forced on The two Stephen sisters, Vanessa and Virginia, far more than her sister Vanessa. The two Stephen sisters, Vanessa and Virginia, also competed for Thoby's's affections. [0] would later confess [0]'s ambivalence over competed to Duncan Grant in 1917: \"indeed one of the concealed worms of my life has been a sister's jealousy \u2013 of a sister I mean; and to feed a sister's jealousy \u2013 of a sister I mean [0] have invented such a myth about her sister Vanessa that [0] scarce know one from t'other.[0] showed an early affinity for writing. Although both parents disapproved of formal education for females, writing was considered a respectable profession for women, and her father's encouraged [0] in this respect. Later, [0] would describe encouraged as \"ever since [0] was a little creature, scribbling a story in the manner of Hawthorne on the green plush sofa in the drawing room at St. Ives while the grown-ups dined\". By the age of five, [0] was writing letters and could tell her father's a story every night. Later, she, Vanessa, and Adrian would develop the tradition of inventing a serial about she, Vanessa, and Adrian's next-door neighbours, every night in the nursery, or in the case of St. Ives, of spirits that resided in the garden. It was [0]'s fascination with books that formed the strongest bond between [0] and her father's. For [0]'s tenth birthday, [0] received an ink-stand, a blotter, drawing book, and a box of writing implements.Leslie Stephen (1932) was in the habit of hiking in Cornwall, and in the spring of 1881 Leslie Stephen (1932) came across a large white house in St Ives, Cornwall, and took out a lease on a large white house in St Ives, Cornwall that September. Although a large white house in St Ives, Cornwall had limited amenities, a large white house in St Ives, Cornwall's main attraction was the view overlooking Porthminster Bay towards the Godrevy Lighthouse, which [0] could see from the upper windows and was to be the central figure in her To the Godrevy Lighthouse (1927). a large white house in St Ives, Cornwall was a large square house, with a terraced garden, divided by hedges, sloping down towards the sea. Each year between 1882 and 1894 from mid-July to mid-September the Stephen family leased a large white house in St Ives, Cornwall as a summer residence. Leslie Stephen (1932)a large white house in St Ives, Cornwall , described a large white house in St Ives, Cornwall as \"The pleasantest of Leslie Stephen (1932)'s memories... refer to the Stephen family's summers, all of which were passed in Cornwall, especially to the thirteen summers (1882\u20131894) at St. Ives. There the Stephen family bought the lease of Talland House: a small but roomy house, with a garden of an acre or two all up and down hill, with quaint little terraces divided by hedges of escallonia, a grape-house and kitchen-garden and a so-called 'orchard' beyond\". a large white house in St Ives, Cornwall was in Leslie Stephen (1932)'s words, a place of \"intense domestic happiness\". [0] described a large white house in St Ives, Cornwall in great detail:\"Our house was...outside the town; on the hill....a square house, like a child's drawing of a house; remarkable only for a large white house in St Ives, Cornwall's flat roof, and the railing with crossed bars of wood that ran around the roof. a large white house in St Ives, Cornwall had...a perfect view\u2014right across Porthminster Bay to the Godrevy Lighthouse. a large white house in St Ives, Cornwall had, running down the hill, little lawns, surrounded by thick escallonia bushes...a large white house in St Ives, Cornwall had so many corners and lawns that each was named...a large white house in St Ives, Cornwall was a large garden\u2014two or three acres at most...You entered a large white house in St Ives, Cornwall by a large wooden gate...up the carriage drive...to the Lookout place...From the Lookout place one had...a perfectly open view of Porthminster Bay....a large lap...flowing to the Lighthouse rocks...with the black and white Lighthouse tower\"Reminiscences 1908, pp. 111\u2013112 In both London and Cornwall, [0] was perpetually entertaining, and was notorious for [0]'s manipulation of [0]'s guests' lives, constantly matchmaking in the belief everyone should be married, the domestic equivalence of [0]'s philanthropy. As her husband observed, \"her husband's was of course, though with all due reserve, a bit of a matchmaker.\" Amongst the Stephen family's guests in 1893 were the Brookes, whose children, including Rupert Brooke, played with the Stephen familythe Stephen family . Rupert and his group of Cambridge Neo-pagans would come to play an important role in Rupert and his group of Cambridge Neo-pagans's lives in the years before the First World War. While Cornwall was supposed to be a summer respite, [0] soon immersed [0] in the work of caring for the sick and poor there, as well as in London. Both at Hyde Park Gate and a large white house in St Ives, Cornwall, the Stephen family mingled with much of the country's literary and artistic circles. Frequent guests included literary figures such as Henry James and George Meredith, as well as James Russell Lowell, and the Stephen family were exposed to much more intellectual conversations than at the Stephen family's Little Holland House. the Stephen family did not return, following [0]'s death in May 1895.For the Stephen family, it was the highlight of the year, and [0]'s most vivid childhood memories were not of London but of Cornwall. In a diary entry of 22 March 1921, [0] described why [0] felt so connected to a large white house in St Ives, Cornwall, looking back to a summer day in August 1890. \"Why am [0] so incredibly and incurably romantic about Cornwall? One's past, [0] suppose; [0] see children running in the garden ... The sound of the sea at night ... almost forty years of life, all built on that, permeated by that: so much [0] could never explain\". Cornwall inspired aspects of [0]'s work, in particular the \"St. Ives Trilogy\" of Jacob's Room (1922), To the Godrevy Lighthouse (1927), and The Waves (1931).Julia Stephen fell ill with influenza in February 1895, and never properly recovered, dying on 5 May, when [0] was 13. dying was a pivotal moment in my life and the beginning of [0]'s struggles with mental illness. Essentially, my life had fallen apart. the Stephen family were travelling abroad at the time of the Stephen family's , and Stella Duckworth returned immediately to take charge and assume Stella Duckworth's role. That summer, rather than return to the memories of St. Ives, the Stephen family went to Freshwater, Isle of Wight, where some of the Stephen family's relatives lived. It was there that [0] had the first of [0]'s many nervous breakdowns, and her sister Vanessa was forced to assume some of her sister Vanessa's role in caring for [0]'s mental state. Stella Duckworth became engaged to Jack Hills the following year and they were married on 10 April 1897, making [0] even more dependent on her sister Vanessa.Stella Duckworth also assumed some of the Stephen family's role, taking upon Stella Duckworth the task of bringing the Stephen family out into society. First her sister Vanessa, then [0], in both cases an equal disaster, for it was not a rite of passage that resonated with either girl and attracted a scathing critique by [0] regarding the conventional expectations of young upper-class women: \"Society in those days was a perfectly competent, perfectly complacent, ruthless machine. A girl had no chance against Society's fangs. No other desires \u2013 say to paint, or to write \u2013 could be taken seriously.\" Rather [0]'s priorities were to escape from the Victorian conventionality of the downstairs drawing room to a \"room of one's own\" to pursue [0]'s writing aspirations. [0] would revisit this criticism in [0]'s depiction of Mrs. Ramsay stating the duties of a Victorian mother in To the Lighthouse \"an unmarried woman has missed the best of life\".The death of Stella Duckworth on 19 July 1897, after a long illness, was a further blow to [0]'s sense of self, and the family dynamics. [0] described the period following the death of both her half-sister, Stella and her father as \"1897\u20131904 \u2013 the seven unhappy years\", referring to \"the lash of a random unheeding flail that pointlessly and brutally killed Theirthe period following the death of both her half-sister, Stella and her father\". In April 1902, her father's became ill, and although her father's underwent surgery later that year her father's never fully recovered, dying on 22 February 1904. her father's's precipitated a further breakdown. Later, [0] would describe a further breakdown as one in which [0] was dealt successive blows as a \"broken chrysalis\" with wings still creased. Chrysalis occurs many times in [0]'s writing but a \"broken chrysalis\" with wings still creased was an image that became a metaphor for those exploring the relationship between [0] and grief. At her father's's , her father's's net worth was \u00a315,715 6s. 6d. (probate 23 March 1904)In the late 19th century, education was sharply divided along gender lines, a tradition that [0] would note and condemn in [0]'s writing. Boys were sent to school, and in upper-middle-class families such as the Stephen family, education involved private boys schools, often boarding schools, and university. Girls, if Girls were afforded the luxury of education, received the luxury of education from Girls's parents, governesses, and tutors. [0] was educated by [0]'s parents who shared the duty. There was a small classroom off the back of the drawing room, with its many windows, which Their found perfect for quiet writing and painting. [0] taught the Stephen family Latin, French, and history, while Leslie Stephen (1932) taught the Stephen family mathematics. the Stephen family also received piano lessons. Supplementing the Stephen family's lessons was the Stephen family's unrestricted access to her father's's vast library, exposing the Stephen family to much of the literary canon, resulting in a greater depth of reading than any of the Stephen family's Cambridge contemporaries, [0]'s reading being described as \"greedy.\" Later, [0] would recall  Even today there may be parents who would doubt the wisdom of allowing a girl of fifteen the free run of a large and quite unexpurgated library. But her father's allowed allowing. There were certain facts \u2013 very briefly, very shyly her father's referred to certain facts. Yet \"Read what you like\", her father's said, and all her father's's books...were to be had without asking.  After public school, the boys in the family all attended Cambridge. the Stephen family derived some indirect benefit from attended, as the boys in the family all introduced the Stephen family to the Stephen family's friends. Another source was the conversation of their father's friends, to whom they were exposed. her father's described their father's friends, to whom they were exposed as \"most of the literary people of mark...clever young writers and barristers, chiefly of the radical persuasion...their father's friends, to whom they were exposed used to meet on Wednesday and Sunday evenings, to smoke and drink and discuss the universe and the reform movement\".Later, between the ages of 15 and 19, [0] was able to pursue higher education. [0] took courses of study, some at degree level, in beginning and advanced Ancient Greek, intermediate Latin and German, together with continental and English history at the Ladies' Department of King's College London at nearby 13 Kensington Square between 1897 and 1901. [0] studied Greek under the eminent scholar George Charles Winter Warr, professor of Classical Literature at King's College London's. In addition [0] had private tutoring in German, Greek, and Latin. One of [0]'s Greek tutors was Clara Pater (1899\u20131900), who taught at King's College London's. Another was Janet Case, who involved [0] in the women's rights movement, and whose obituary [0] would later write in 1937. [0]'s experiences led to [0]'s 1925 essay \"On Not Knowing Greek.\" [0]'s time at King's College London's also brought [0] into contact with some of the early reformers of women's higher education such as the principal of the Ladies' Department of King's College London at nearby 13 Kensington Square, Lilian Faithfull (one of the so-called steamboat ladies), in addition to Pater. [0]'s sister Vanessa also enrolled at the Ladies' Department of King's College London at nearby 13 Kensington Square (1899\u20131901). Although the Stephen family the Stephen family could not attend Cambridge, the Stephen family were to be profoundly influenced by the Stephen family's brothers' experiences there. When Thoby's went to Trinity in 1899, Thoby's befriended a circle of young men, including Clive Bell, Lytton Strachey, Leonard Woolf (whom [0] would later marry), and Saxon Sydney-Turner, whom Thoby's would soon introduce to Thoby's's sisters at the Trinity May Ball in 1900. These men formed a reading group These men named the Midnight Society.Although [0] expressed the opinion that her father's was [0]'s favourite parent, and although [0] had only turned thirteen when her mother died, [0] was profoundly influenced by her mother throughout my life. It was [0] who famously stated that \"for we think back through we's mothers if we are women\", and invoked the image of her mother repeatedly throughout my life in [0]'s diaries, [0]'s letters and a number of [0]'s autobiographical essays, including Reminiscences (1908), 22 Hyde Park Gate (1921) and A Sketch of the Past (1940), frequently evoking [0]'s memories with the words \"[0] see her mother ...\". [0] also alludes to [0]'s childhood in [0]'s fictional writing. In To the Godrevy Lighthouse (1927), the artist, Lily Briscoe, attempts to paint Mrs. Ramsay, a complex character based on Julia Stephen, and repeatedly comments on the fact that Mrs. Ramsay, a complex character based on Julia Stephen was \"astonishingly beautiful\". the artist, Lily Briscoe's depiction of the life of the Ramsays in the Hebrides is an only thinly disguised account of the Stephens in Cornwall and the Godrevy Lighthouse the Stephens in Cornwall would visit there. However, [0]'s understanding of her mother and family evolved considerably between 1907 and 1940, in which the somewhat distant, yet revered figure becomes more nuanced and complete.While her father's painted [0]'s work in terms of reverence, [0] drew a sharp distinction between [0]'s work and \"the mischievous philanthropy which other women practise so complacently and often with such disastrous results.\" [0] describes [0]'s degree of sympathy, engagement, judgement, and decisiveness, and [0]'s sense of both irony and the absurd. [0] recalls trying to recapture \"the clear round voice, or the sight of the beautiful figure, so upright and distinct, in its long shabby cloak, with the head held at a certain angle, so that the eye the beautiful figure, so upright and distinct, in its long shabby cloak, with the head held at a certain angle, so that the eye's looked straight out at you.\" [0] dealt with her father's's depressions and her father's's need for attention, which created resentment in the Stephen family, boosted her father's's self-confidence, nursed both parents in both parents's final illness, and had many commitments outside the home that would eventually wear [0] down. [0]'s frequent absences and the demands of her father's instilled a sense of insecurity in the Stephen family that had a lasting effect on the Stephen family. In considering the demands on her mother, [0] described her father's as \"fifteen years her mother's elder, difficult, exacting, dependent on her mother,\" and reflected that it was at the expense of the amount of attention [0] could spare the Stephen family: \"a general presence rather than a particular person to a child.\" [0] reflected that [0] rarely ever spent a moment alone with her mother: \"someone was always interrupting.\" [0] was ambivalent about it, yet eager to separate [0] from [0]. In To the Lighthouse, [0] describes the Lighthouse as \"boasting of [0]'s capacity to surround and protect, there was scarcely a shell of [0] left for [0] to know [0] by; all was so lavished and spent.\" At the same time, [0] admired the strengths of [0]'s womanly ideals. Given [0]'s frequent absences and commitments, the Stephen family became increasingly dependent on Stella Duckworth; as [0] wrote, \"Stella Duckworth was always the beautiful attendant handmaid ... making it the central duty of [0]'s life.\"Julia Stephen greatly admired her father's's intellect. As [0] observed \"[0] never belittled her own works, thinking her own works, if properly discharged, of equal, though other, importance with her father's's.\" [0] believed with certainty in [0]'s role as the centre of [0]'s activities, and the person who held everything together, with a firm sense of what was important and valuing devotion. Of both parents, [0]'s \"nervous energy dominated the family\". While [0] identified most closely with her father's, her sister Vanessa stated her sister Vanessa's was her sister Vanessa's favourite parent. Angelica Garnett recalls how [0] asked her sister Vanessa which parent [0] preferred, although her sister Vanessa considered it a question that \"one ought not to ask\", her sister Vanessa was unequivocal in answering \"Mother\" yet the centrality of her mother to [0]'s world is expressed in this description of her mother \"Certainly there her mother was, in the very centre of that great Cathedral space which was childhood; there her mother was from the very first\". [0] observed that her half-sister, Stella, the oldest daughter, led a life of total subservience to her half-sister, Stella, the oldest daughter,'s , incorporating her mother's ideals of love and service. [0], like her father's, quickly learned that being ill was the only reliable way of gaining the attention of her motherher mother her mother's .Another issue the Stephen family had to deal with was her father's's temper, [0] describing her father's as \"the tyrant father\". Eventually, [0] became deeply ambivalent about her father's. her father's had given [0] her father's's ring on [0]'s eighteenth birthday and [0] had a deep emotional attachment as her father's's literary heir, writing about [0]'s \"great devotion for her father's\". Yet, like her sister Vanessa, [0] also saw her father's as victimiser and tyrant. [0] had a lasting ambivalence towards her father's through my life, albeit one that evolved. [0]'s adolescent image was of an \"Eminent Victorian\" and tyrant, but as [0] grew older [0] began to realise how much of her father's was in [0]: \"[0] have been dipping into old letters and father's memoirs....so candid and reasonable and transparent\u2014and had such a fastidious delicate mind, educated, and transparent,\" [0] wrote 22 December 1940. [0] was in turn both fascinated and condemnatory of her father's: \"her mother has haunted [0]: but then, so did her father'sher father's. . . . [0] was more like her father's than her mother, [0] think; and therefore more critical: but her father's was an adorable man, and somehow, tremendous.[0] stated that [0] first remembers being molested by Gerald Duckworth when [0] was six years old. It has been suggested that molested led to a lifetime of sexual fear and resistance tomasculine authority. Against a background of over-committed and distant parents, suggestions that this was a dysfunctional family must be evaluated. suggestions that this was a dysfunctional family include evidence of sexual abuse of the Stephen family by the Stephen family's older Duckworth half-brothers, and by the Stephen family's cousin, James Kenneth Stephen (1859\u20131892), at least of her half-sister, Stella, the oldest daughter,. Laura is also thought to have been abused. The most graphic account is by Louise DeSalvo, but other authors and reviewers have been more cautious. [0]'s accounts of being continually sexually abused during the time that [0] lived at 22 Hyde Park Gate, have been cited by some critics as a possible cause of [0]'s mental health issues, although there are likely to be a number of contributing factors. Hermione Lee states that, \"The evidence is strong enough, and yet ambiguous enough, to open the way for conflicting psychobiographical interpretations that draw quite different shapes of [0]'s interior life\".", "Bloomsbury (1904\u20131940)": "Virginia Woolf is our person to focus on. On their father's death, [0]'s first instinct was to escape from the dark house of yet more mourning, and escape [0] did immediately, accompanied by George, travelling to Manorbier, on the coast of Pembrokeshire on 27 February. There, [0] spent a month, and it was there that Virginia Woolf first came to realise Virginia Woolf's destiny was as a writer, as Virginia Woolf recalls in Virginia Woolf's diary of 3 September 1922. [0] then further pursued [0]'s newfound freedom by spending April in Italy and France, where [0] met up with Clive Bell again. Virginia Woolf then suffered Virginia Woolf's second nervous breakdown, and first suicidal attempt on 10 May, and convalesced over the next three months.Before their father's their father's death, [0] had discussed the need to leave South Kensington in the West End, with its tragic memories and their parents' relationsSouth Kensington in the West End, with its tragic memories and their parents' relations's . George was 35, his brother Gerald 33. [0] were now between 24 and 20. Virginia Woolf was 22. Virginia Woolf Adrian decided to sell 22 Hyde Park Gate in respectable South Kensington and move to Bloomsbury. Bloomsbury Bloomsbury's seemed sufficiently far away, geographically and socially, and was a much cheaper neighbourhood rentwise. [0] had not inherited much and [0] were unsure about [0]'s finances. Also, Bloomsbury was close to the Slade School which Virginia Woolf was then attending. While his brother Gerald was quite happy to move on and find his brother Gerald a bachelor establishment, George decided to accompany [0], much to [0]'s dismay. It was then that Lady Margaret Herbert appeared on the scene, George proposed, was accepted and married in September, leaving [0] to [0]'s own devices.Virginia Woolf found a house at 46 Gordon Square in Bloomsbury, and [0] moved in November, to be joined by Virginia Woolf. It was at 46 Gordon Square in Bloomsbury that [0] began to regularly entertain Thoby's intellectual friends in March 1905. Thoby's intellectual friends, included writers (Saxon Sydney-Turner, Lytton Strachey) and critics (Clive Bell, Desmond MacCarthy) with Thursday evening \"At Homes\" that became known as the Thursday Club, a vision of recreating Trinity College (\"Cambridge in London\"). Thoby's intellectual friends formed the nucleus of Thoby's intellectual friends. Later, Thoby's intellectual friends would include John Maynard Keynes (1907), Duncan Grant (1908), E.M. Forster (1910), Roger Fry (1910), Leonard Woolf (1911), and David Garnett (1914).In 1905, Virginia Woolf Adrian visited Portugal and Spain. Clive Bell proposed to Virginia Woolf, but was declined, while Virginia Woolf began teaching evening classes at Morley College and Virginia Woolf added another event to [0]'s calendar with the Friday Club, dedicated to the discussion of and later exhibition of the fine arts. the Friday Club, dedicated to the discussion of and later exhibition of the fine arts introduced some new people into Thoby's intellectual friends, including Virginia Woolf's friends from the Royal Academy and Slade, such as Henry Lamb and Gwen Darwin (who became secretary), but also the eighteen-year-old Katherine Laird (\"Ka\") Cox (1887\u20131938), who was about to go up to Newnham. Although Virginia Woolf did not actually meet the eighteen-year-old Katherine Laird (\"Ka\") Cox (1887\u20131938), who was about to go up to Newnham until much later, the eighteen-year-old Katherine Laird (\"Ka\") Cox (1887\u20131938), who was about to go up to Newnham would come to play an important part in her life. the eighteen-year-old Katherine Laird (\"Ka\") Cox (1887\u20131938), who was about to go up to Newnham and others brought Thoby's intellectual friends into contact with another, slightly younger, group of Cambridge intellectuals to whom the Stephen sisters gave the name \"Neo-pagans\". the Friday Club, dedicated to the discussion of and later exhibition of the fine arts continued until 1913. The following year, 1906, Virginia Woolf suffered two further losses. Virginia Woolf's cherished brother Thoby, who was only 26, died of typhoid, following a trip [0] had all taken to Greece, and immediately afterward Virginia Woolf accepted Clive Bell's third proposal. Virginia Woolf Clive Bell were married in February 1907 and as a couple, [0]'s interest in avant-garde art would have an important influence on Leonard Woolf's further development as an author. With Virginia Woolf's , Virginia Woolf Adrian needed to find a new home.Virginia Woolf moved into 29 Fitzroy Square in April 1907, a house on the west side of the street, formerly occupied by George Bernard Shaw. a house on the west side of the street, formerly occupied by George Bernard Shaw was in 29 Fitzroy Square46 Gordon Square in Bloomsbury. [0] continued to travel together, visiting Paris in March 1905. Adrian was now to play a much larger part in her life, and [0] resumed the Thursday Club in October at their new home, while 46 Gordon Square in Bloomsbury became the venue for the Play Reading Society in December. During this period, Thoby's intellectual friends began to increasingly explore progressive ideas, first in speech, and then in conduct, Virginia Woolf proclaiming in 1910 a libertarian society with sexual freedom for all.Meanwhile, Virginia Woolf began work on Virginia Woolf's first novel, Melymbrosia, that eventually became The Voyage Out (1915). Virginia Woolf's first child, Julian was born in February 1908, and in September Virginia Woolf accompanied the Bells to Italy and France. It was during this time that Virginia Woolf's rivalry with Virginia Woolf resurfaced, flirting with Clive Bell, which Clive Bell reciprocated, and which lasted on and off from 1908 to 1914, by which time Virginia Woolf's marriage was breaking down. On 17 February 1909, Lytton Strachey proposed to Virginia Woolf and Virginia Woolf accepted, but Lytton Strachey then withdrew proposed.It was while Virginia Woolf was at 46 Gordon Square in Bloomsbury that the question arose of Virginia Woolf needing a quiet country retreat, and Virginia Woolf required a six-week rest cure and sought the countryside away from London as much as possible. In December, she and Adrian stayed at Lewes and started exploring the area of Sussex around Lewes. Virginia Woolf started to want a place of Virginia Woolf's own, like St Ives, but closer to London. Virginia Woolf soon found a property in nearby Firle (see below), maintaining a relationship with nearby Firle for the rest of her life.Several members of Thoby's intellectual friends attained notoriety in 1910 with the Dreadnought hoax, which Virginia participated in disguised as a male Abyssinian royal. Virginia Woolf's complete 1940 talk on the Dreadnought hoax, which Virginia participated in disguised as a male Abyssinian royal was discovered and is published in the memoirs collected in the expanded edition of The Platform of Time (2008).In October 1911, the lease on 46 Gordon Square in Bloomsbury was running out and she and Adrian decided to give up their new home 46 Gordon Square in Bloomsbury in favour of a different living arrangement, moving to a four-storied house at 38 Brunswick Square in Bloomsbury proper in November. Virginia Woolf saw a four-storied house at 38 Brunswick Square in Bloomsbury proper as a new opportunity: \"Thoby's intellectual friends are going to try all kinds of experiments,\" Virginia Woolf told Ottoline Morrell. Adrian occupied the second floor, with John Maynard Keynes and Duncan Grant sharing the ground floor. This arrangement for a single woman was considered scandalous, and George was horrified. a four-storied house at 38 Brunswick Square in Bloomsbury proper was adjacent to the Foundling Hospital, much to Virginia Woolf's amusement as Virginia Woolf. Originally, Ka Cox was supposed to share in This arrangement for a single woman, but opposition came from Rupert Brooke, who was involved with Ka Cox and pressured Ka Cox to abandon share. At a four-storied house at 38 Brunswick Square in Bloomsbury proper, Duncan Grant decorated Adrian's rooms (see image).", "Marriage (1912\u20131941)": "Virginia Woolf is our person to focus on. Leonard Woolf was one of [0]'s friends at Trinity College, Cambridge, and noticed the Stephen sisters in Thoby's rooms there on the Stephen sisters in Thoby's rooms there's visits to the May Ball in 1900 and 1901. Leonard Woolf recalls them in \"white dresses and large hats, with parasols in the Stephen sisters in Thoby's rooms there's hands, the Stephen sisters in Thoby's rooms there's beauty literally took one's breath away\". To Leonard Woolf, the Stephen sisters in Thoby's rooms there were silent, \"formidable and alarming\".Leonard Woolf did not meet Virginia Woolf formally till 17 November 1904 when Leonard Woolf dined with the Stephen sisters in Thoby's rooms there at Gordon Square, to say goodbye before leaving to take up a position with the civil service in Ceylon, although Virginia Woolf was aware of Leonard Woolf through [0]'s stories. At dined Leonard Woolf noted that Virginia Woolf was perfectly silent throughout the meal, and looked ill. In 1909, Lytton Strachey suggested to Leonard Woolf Leonard Woolf should make Virginia Woolf an offer of marriage. Leonard Woolf did so, but received no answer. In June 1911, Leonard Woolf returned to London on a one-year leave, but did not go back to Ceylon. In England again, Leonard Woolf renewed Leonard Woolf's contacts with family and friends. Three weeks after arriving Leonard Woolf dined with Vanessa and Clive Bell at Gordon Square on 3 July, where they were later joined by Virginia Woolf and other members of what would later be called \"Bloomsbury\", and Leonard Woolf dates other members of what would later be called \"Bloomsbury\"'s formation to that night. In September, Virginia Woolf asked Leonard Woolf to join Virginia Woolf at Little Talland House at Firle in Sussex for a long weekend. After a long weekend, they began seeing each other more frequently.On 4 December 1911, Leonard Woolf moved into the m\u00e9nage on Brunswick Square, occupying a bedroom and sitting room on the fourth floor, and started to see Virginia Woolf constantly and by the end of the month had decided Leonard Woolf was in love with Virginia Woolf. On 11 January 1912, Leonard Woolf proposed to Virginia Woolf; Virginia Woolf asked for time to consider, so Leonard Woolf asked for an extension of Leonard Woolf's leave and, on being refused, offered Leonard Woolf's resignation on 25 April, effective 20 May. Leonard Woolf continued to pursue Virginia Woolf, and in a letter of 1 May 1912 (which see)[clarification needed] Virginia Woolf explained why Virginia Woolf did not favour a marriage. However, on 29 May, Virginia Woolf told Leonard Woolf that Virginia Woolf wished to marry Leonard Woolf, and they were married on 10 August at the St Pancras Register Office. It was during this time that Leonard Woolf first became aware of Virginia Woolf's precarious mental state. they continued to live at Brunswick Square until October 1912, when they moved to a small flat at 13 Clifford's Inn, further to the east (subsequently demolished). Despite Leonard Woolf's low material status (Virginia Woolf referring to Leonard Woolf during they's engagement as a \"penniless Jew\"), they shared a close bond. Indeed, in 1937, Virginia Woolf wrote in Virginia Woolf's diary: \"Love-making\u2014after 25 years can't bear to be separate ... you see it is enormous pleasure being wanted: a wife. And they's marriage so complete.\" However, Virginia Woolf made a suicide attempt in 1913.In October 1914, Leonard Woolf Virginia Woolf moved away from Bloomsbury and central London to Richmond, living at 17 The Green, a home discussed by Leonard Woolf in Leonard Woolf's autobiography Beginning Again (1964). In early March 1915, they moved again, to nearby Hogarth House, Paradise Road, after which they named their publishing house. Virginia Woolf's first novel, The Voyage Out was published in 1915, followed by another suicide attempt. Despite the introduction of conscription in 1916, Leonard Woolf was exempted on medical grounds. they Virginia Woolf employed two servants at the recommendation of Roger Fry in 1916. Nellie Boxall would stay with they for eighteen years. Nellie Boxall's difficult relationship with Nellie Boxall's boss[clarification needed] was recorded in Virginia Woolf's diaries and letters and Virginia Woolf noted that there were no maids in her father's's Dictionary of National Biography (Nellie Boxall was to be included)[further explanation needed].Between 1924 and 1940 they returned to Bloomsbury, taking out a ten-year lease at 52 Tavistock Square, from where they ran their publishing house from the basement, where Virginia Woolf also had Virginia Woolf's writing room, and is commemorated with a bust of Virginia Woolf in 52 Tavistock Square (see illustration). 1925 saw the publication of Mrs Dalloway in May followed by Virginia Woolf's collapse while at Charleston in August. In 1927, Virginia Woolf's next novel, To the Lighthouse, was published, and the following year Virginia Woolf lectured on Women & Fiction at Cambridge University and published Orlando in October. Virginia Woolf's two Cambridge University lectures then became the basis for Virginia Woolf's major essay A Room of One's Own in 1929. Virginia Woolf wrote only one drama, Freshwater, based on Virginia Woolf's great-aunt Julia Margaret Cameron, and produced at Virginia Woolf's sister's studio on Fitzroy Street in 1935. 1936 saw another collapse of Virginia Woolf's health following the completion of The Years.they's final residence in London was at 37 Mecklenburgh Square (1939\u20131940), destroyed during the Blitz in September 1940; a month later they's previous home on Tavistock Square was also destroyed. After that, they made Sussex they's permanent home. For descriptions and illustrations of all Virginia Woolf's London homes, see Jean Moorcroft Wilson's book Virginia Woolf, Life and London: A Biography of Place (pub. Cecil Woolf, 1987).Virginia had taken up book-binding as a pastime in October 1901, at the age of 19, and they had been discussing setting up their publishing house for some time, and at the end of 1916 started making plans. Having discovered that they were not eligible to enroll in the St Bride School of Printing, they started purchasing supplies after seeking advice from the Excelsior Printing Supply Company on Farringdon Road in March 1917, and soon they had a printing press set up on they's dining room table at Hogarth House, and their publishing house was born.Their first publication was Two Stories in July 1917, inscribed Publication No. 1, and consisted of Two Stories. Their first publication consisted of 32 pages, hand bound and sewn, and illustrated by woodcuts designed by Dora Carrington. woodcuts designed by Dora Carrington were a success, leading Virginia Woolf to remark that their publishing house was \"specially good at printing pictures, and they see that they must make a practice of always having pictures.\" (13 July 1917) The process took two and a half months with a production run of 150 copies. Other short short stories followed, including Kew Gardens (1919) with a woodblock by Vanessa Bell as frontispiece. Subsequently, Vanessa Bell added further illustrations, adorning each page of the text.their publishing house subsequently published Virginia Woolf's novels along with works by T.S. Eliot, Laurens van der Post, and others. their publishing house also commissioned works by contemporary artists, including Dora Carrington and Vanessa Bell. Virginia Woolf believed that to break free of a patriarchal society women writers needed a \"room of women writers's own\" to develop and often fantasised about an \"Outsider's Society\" where women writers would create a virtual private space for themselves via their writings to develop a feminist critique of society. Though Virginia Woolf never created an \"Outsider's Society\" where women writers would create a virtual private space for themselves via their writings to develop a feminist critique of society, their publishing house was the closest approximation as they chose to publish books by writers that took unconventional points of view to form a reading community. Initially their publishing house concentrated on small experimental publications, of little interest to large commercial publishers. Until 1930, Virginia Woolf often helped Virginia Woolf's husband print the their publishing house books as the money for employees was not there. Virginia Woolf relinquished Virginia Woolf's interest in 1938, following a third attempted suicide. After their publishing house was bombed in September 1940, their publishing house was moved to Letchworth for the remainder of the war. they were internationalists and pacifists who believed that promoting understanding between peoples was the best way to avoid another world war and chose quite consciously to publish works by foreign authors of whom the British reading public were unaware. The first non-British author to be published was the Soviet writer Maxim Gorky, the book Reminiscences of Leo Nikolaiovich Tolstoy in 1920, dealing with Leo Nikolaiovich Tolstoy's friendship with Count Leo Tolstoy.1920 saw a postwar reconstitution of other members of what would later be called \"Bloomsbury\", under the title of the Memoir Club, which as the name suggests focussed on self-writing, in the manner of Proust's A La Recherche, and inspired some of the more influential books of the 20th century. The Group, which had been scattered by the war, was reconvened by Mary ('Molly') MacCarthy who called other members of what would later be called \"Bloomsbury\" \"Bloomsberries\", and operated under rules derived from the Cambridge Apostles, an elite university debating society that a number of them had been members of. rules derived from the Cambridge Apostles, an elite university debating society that a number of them had been members of emphasised candour and openness. Among the 125 memoirs presented, Virginia Woolf contributed three that were published posthumously in 1976, in the autobiographical anthology Moments of Being. three that were published posthumously in 1976 were 22 Hyde Park Gate (1921), Old Bloomsbury (1922) and Am I a Snob? (1936).The ethos of other members of what would later be called \"Bloomsbury\" encouraged a liberal approach to sexuality, and on 14 December 1922 Virginia Woolf met the writer and gardener Vita Sackville-West, wife of Harold Nicolson, while dining with Clive Bell. Writing in Virginia Woolf's diary the next day, Virginia Woolf referred to meeting \"the writer and gardener Vita Sackville-West, wife of Harold Nicolson\". At the time, the writer and gardener Vita Sackville-West, wife of Harold Nicolson, was the more successful writer as both poet and novelist, commercially and critically, and it was not until after Virginia Woolf's death that the writer and gardener Vita Sackville-West, wife of Harold Nicolson, became considered the better writer. After a tentative start, they began a sexual relationship, which, according to Sackville-West in a letter to her husband on 17 August 1926, was only twice consummated. a sexual relationship, which, according to Sackville-West in a letter to her husband on 17 August 1926, was only twice consummated reached a sexual relationship, which, according to Sackville-West in a letter to her husband on 17 August 1926, was only twice consummated's peak between 1925 and 1926, evolving into more of a friendship through the 1930s, though Virginia Woolf was also inclined to brag of Virginia Woolf's affairs with other women within Virginia Woolf's intimate circle, such as Sibyl Colefax and Comtesse de Polignac. a sexual relationship, which, according to Sackville-West in a letter to her husband on 17 August 1926, was only twice consummated was to prove fruitful for they, Virginia Woolf producing three novels, To the Lighthouse (1927), Orlando (1926), and The Waves (1931) as well as a number of essays, including \"Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown\" (1924) and \"A Letter to a Young Poet\" (the writer and gardener Vita Sackville-West, wife of Harold Nicolson, worked tirelessly to lift Virginia Woolf's self-esteem, encouraging Virginia Woolf not to view Virginia Woolf as a quasi-reclusive inclined to sickness who should hide herself away from the worlda quasi-reclusive inclined to sickness who should hide herself away from the world , but rather offered praise for Virginia Woolf's liveliness and wit, Virginia Woolf's health, Virginia Woolf's intelligence and achievements as a writer. the writer and gardener Vita Sackville-West, wife of Harold Nicolson, led Virginia Woolf to reappraise Virginia Woolf, developing a more positive self-image, and the feeling that Virginia Woolf's writings were the products of Virginia Woolf's strengths rather than Virginia Woolf's weakness. Starting at the age of 15, Virginia Woolf had believed the diagnosis by her father's and her father's's doctor that reading and writing were deleterious to Virginia Woolf's nervous condition, requiring a regime of physical labour such as gardening to prevent a total nervous collapse. believed led Virginia Woolf to spend much time obsessively engaging in such physical labour.the writer and gardener Vita Sackville-West, wife of Harold Nicolson, was the first to argue to Virginia Woolf Virginia Woolf had been misdiagnosed, and that it was far better to engage in reading and writing to calm Virginia Woolf's nerves\u2014advice that was taken. Under the influence of the writer and gardener Vita Sackville-West, wife of Harold Nicolson,, Virginia Woolf learned to deal with Virginia Woolf's nervous ailments by switching between various forms of intellectual activities such as reading, writing and book reviews, instead of spending Virginia Woolf's time in physical activities that sapped Virginia Woolf's strength and worsened Virginia Woolf's nerves. the writer and gardener Vita Sackville-West, wife of Harold Nicolson, chose their publishing house as the writer and gardener Vita Sackville-West, wife of Harold Nicolson,'s publisher to assist they financially. Seducers in Ecuador, the first of the novels by Sackville-West published by Hogarth, was not a success, selling only 1500 copies in Seducers in Ecuador, the first of the novels by Sackville-West published by Hogarth,'s first year, but the next Sackville-West novel they published, The Edwardians, the writer and gardener Vita Sackville-West, wife of Harold Nicolson, was a best-seller that sold 30,000 copies in the next Sackville-West novel they published, The Edwardians,'s first six months. the writer and gardener Vita Sackville-West, wife of Harold Nicolson,'s , though not typical of their publishing house, saved their publishing house, taking their publishing house from the red into the black. However, Virginia Woolf was not always appreciative of the fact that it was the writer and gardener Vita Sackville-West, wife of Harold Nicolson,'s that kept their publishing house profitable, writing dismissively in 1933 of Virginia Woolf's \"servant girl\" novels. The financial security allowed by the good sales of the writer and gardener Vita Sackville-West, wife of Harold Nicolson,'s in turn allowed Virginia Woolf to engage in more experimental work, such as The Waves, as Virginia Woolf had to be cautious when Virginia Woolf depended upon their publishing house entirely for Virginia Woolf's income.In 1926, Virginia Woolf presented the writer and gardener Vita Sackville-West, wife of Harold Nicolson, with Orlando. Orlando was published in October, shortly after they spent a week travelling together in France, that September. Nigel Nicolson, the writer and gardener Vita Sackville-West, wife of Harold Nicolson,'s son, wrote, \"The effect of Vita on Virginia Woolf is all contained in Orlando, the longest and most charming love letter in literature, in which the writer and gardener Vita Sackville-West, wife of Harold Nicolson, explores Virginia Woolf, weaves Virginia Woolf in and out of the centuries, tosses Virginia Woolf from one sex to the other, plays with Virginia Woolf, dresses Virginia Woolf in furs, lace and emeralds, teases Virginia Woolf, flirts with Virginia Woolf, drops a veil of mist around Virginia Woolf.\" After they's affair ended, they remained friends until Virginia Woolf's death in 1941. Virginia Woolf also remained close to Virginia Woolf's surviving siblings, Adrian and Vanessa; [0] had died of typhoid fever at the age of 26.", "Sussex (1911\u20131941)": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was needing a country retreat to escape to, and on 24 December 1910, [0] found a house for rent in Firle, Sussex, near Lewes (see Map). [0] obtained a lease and took possession of a house for rent in Firle, Sussex, near Lewes (see Map) the following month, naming a house for rent in Firle, Sussex, near Lewes (see Map) 'Little Talland House', after their childhood home in Cornwall, although a house for rent in Firle, Sussex, near Lewes (see Map) was actually a new red gabled villa on the main street opposite the village hall.[aa] a lease was a short one, and in October, she and Leonard Woolf found Asham House[ab] at Asheham a few miles to the west, while walking along the Ouse from Firle, Sussex, near Lewes. Located at the end of a tree-lined road, Asham House[ab] at Asheham a few miles to the west was a strange, beautiful, Regency-Gothic house in a lonely location. [0] described Asham House[ab] at Asheham a few miles to the west as \"flat, pale, serene, yellow-washed\", without electricity or water and allegedly haunted. [0] took out a five-year lease jointly with Vanessa in the new year, and she and Leonard Woolf moved into Asham House[ab] at Asheham a few miles to the west in February 1912, holding a housewarming party on the 9th.It was at Asham House[ab] at Asheham a few miles to the west that she and Leonard Woolf spent she and Leonard Woolf's wedding night later that year. At Asham House[ab] at Asheham a few miles to the west, [0] recorded the events of the weekends and holidays she and Leonard Woolf spent there in [0]'s Asham House[ab] at Asheham a few miles to the west Diary, part of which was later published as A Writer's Diary in 1953. In terms of creative writing, The Voyage Out was completed there, and much of Night and Day. Asham House[ab] at Asheham a few miles to the west provided [0] with much-needed relief from the pace of London life, and was where [0] found a happiness that [0] expressed in [0]'s diary on 5 May 1919 \"Oh, but how happy she and Leonard Woolf've been at Asham House[ab] at Asheham a few miles to the west! It was a most melodious time. Everything went so freely; \u2013 but [0] can't analyse all the sources of [0]'s joy\". Asham House[ab] at Asheham a few miles to the west was also the inspiration for A Haunted House (1921\u20131944), and was painted by members of the Bloomsbury Group, including Vanessa and Roger Fry. It was during these times at Asham House[ab] at Asheham a few miles to the west that Ka Cox (seen here) started to devote Ka Cox (seen here) to [0] and become very useful.While at Asham House[ab] at Asheham a few miles to the west, in 1916 she and Leonard Woolf found a farmhouse to let about four miles away, which they thought would be ideal for her sister. Eventually, Vanessa came down to inspect a farmhouse to let about four miles away, which they thought would be ideal for her sister, and moved in in October of 1916, taking a farmhouse to let about four miles away, which they thought would be ideal for her sister as a summer home for Vanessa's family. a farmhouse to let about four miles away, which they thought would be ideal for her sister was to become the summer gathering place for the literary and artistic circle of the Bloomsbury Group.After the end of the war, in 1918, she and Leonard Woolf were given a year's notice by the landlord, who needed a farmhouse to let about four miles away, which they thought would be ideal for her sister. In mid-1919, \"in despair\", she and Leonard Woolf purchased \"a very strange little house\" for \u00a3300, the Round House in Pipe Passage, Lewes, a converted windmill. No sooner had she and Leonard Woolf bought \"a very strange little house\", than Monk's House in nearby Rodmell, came up for auction, Monk's House in nearby Rodmell. she and Leonard Woolf favoured Monk's House in nearby Rodmell because of Monk's House in nearby Rodmell's orchard and garden, and sold \"a very strange little house\" to purchase Monk's House in nearby Rodmell for \u00a3700. Monk's House in nearby Rodmell also lacked water and electricity, but came with an acre of garden, and had a view across the Ouse towards the hills of the South Downs. Leonard Woolf describes a view across the Ouse towards the hills of the South Downs (and the amenities) as being unchanged since the days of Chaucer. From 1940, Monk's House in nearby Rodmell became she and Leonard Woolf's permanent home after she and Leonard Woolf's London home was bombed, and [0] continued to live there until [0]'s death. Meanwhile, Vanessa made a farmhouse to let about four miles away, which they thought would be ideal for her sister Vanessa's permanent home in 1936. It was at Monk's House in nearby Rodmell that [0] completed Between the Acts in early 1941, followed by a further breakdown directly resulting in [0]'s suicide on 28 March 1941, the novel being published posthumously later that year.", "The Neo-pagans (1911\u20131912)": "[0] is our person to focus on. During [0]'s time in Firle, [0] became better acquainted with Rupert Brooke and his social circle, nicknamed the Neo-Pagans, pursuing socialism, vegetarianism, exercising outdoors and alternative life styles, including social nudity. Rupert Brooke and his social circle, nicknamed the Neo-Pagans, pursuing socialism, vegetarianism, exercising outdoors and alternative life styles, including social nudity were influenced by the ethos of Bedales, Fabianism and Shelley. Rupert Brooke and his social circle, nicknamed the Neo-Pagans, pursuing socialism, vegetarianism, exercising outdoors and alternative life styles, including social nudity wore sandals, socks, open neck shirts and head-scarves. Although [0] had some reservations, [0] was involved with Rupert Brooke and his social circle, nicknamed the Neo-Pagans, pursuing socialism, vegetarianism, exercising outdoors and alternative life styles, including social nudity's activities for a while, fascinated by Rupert Brooke and his social circle, nicknamed the Neo-Pagans, pursuing socialism, vegetarianism, exercising outdoors and alternative life styles, including social nudity's bucolic innocence in contrast to the sceptical intellectualism of Bloomsbury, which earned [0] the nickname \"The Goat\" from [0]'s brother Adrian.[ac] While [0] liked to make much of a weekend she spent with Brooke at the vicarage in Grantchester, including swimming in the pool there, a weekend she spent with Brooke at the vicarage in Grantchester appears to have been principally a literary assignation. They also shared a psychiatrist, Maurice Craig. Through Rupert Brooke and his social circle, nicknamed the Neo-Pagans, pursuing socialism, vegetarianism, exercising outdoors and alternative life styles, including social nudity, [0] finally met Ka Cox on a weekend in Oxford in January 1911, who had been part of the Friday Club circle and now became [0]'s friend and played an important part in dealing with [0]'s illnesses. [0] nicknamed Ka Cox \"Bruin\". At the same time, [0] found [0] dragged into a triangular relationship involving Ka Cox, Jacques Raverat and Gwen Darwin. [0] became resentful of the other couple, Jacques and Gwen, who married later in 1911, not the outcome Virginia had predicted or desired. the other couple, Jacques and Gwen, who married later in 1911, not the outcome Virginia had predicted or desired would later be referred to in both To the Lighthouse and The Years. The exclusion [0] felt evoked memories of both Stella Duckworth's's marriage and Stella Duckworth's's triangular involvement with Vanessa and Clive.The two groups eventually fell out. Rupert Brooke pressured Ka Cox into withdrawing from joining Virginia's m\u00e9nage on Brunswick Square in late 1911, calling Virginia's m\u00e9nage on Brunswick Square a \"bawdy-house\" and by the end of 1912 Rupert Brooke had vehemently turned against Bloomsbury. Later, [0] would write sardonically about Rupert BrookeRupert Brooke's , and express regret about \"the Neo-Paganism at that stage of [0]'s life\". [0] was deeply disappointed when Ka Cox married William Edward Arnold-Forster in 1918, and became increasingly critical of Ka Cox.", "Mental health": "[0] is our person to focus on. Much examination has been made of Woolf's mental health (e.g., see Mental health bibliography). From the age of 13, following the death of her mother, [0] suffered periodic mood swings from severe depression to manic excitement, including psychotic episodes, which the family referred to as [0]'s \"madness\". However, as Hermione Lee points out, [0] was not \"mad\"; [0] was merely a woman who suffered from and struggled with illness for much of her life, a woman of \"exceptional courage, intelligence and stoicism\", who made the best use, and achieved the best understanding [0] could of that illness.[ad]Modern psychiatrists contend that Woolf's mental health constituted bipolar disorder (manic-depressive illness). her mother's death in 1895, \"the greatest disaster that could happen\", precipitated a crisis of alternating excitability and depression accompanied by irrational fears, for which the family's family doctor, Dr. Seton, prescribed rest, stopping lessons and writing, and regular walks supervised by her mother. Yet just two years later, her mother too was dead, bringing on [0]'s next crisis in 1897, and [0]'s first expressed wish for death at the age of fifteen, writing in [0]'s diary that October that \"death would be shorter & less painful\". [0] then stopped keeping a diary for some time. This was a scenario [0] would later recreate in \"Time Passes\" (To the Lighthouse, 1927).The death of her father in 1904 provoked [0]'s most alarming collapse, on 10 May, when [0] threw [0] out a window and [0] was briefly institutionalised under the care of her father's friend, the eminent psychiatrist George Savage. her father's friend, the eminent psychiatrist George Savage blamed [0]'s education\u2014frowned on by many at the time as unsuitable for women\u2014for Woolf's mental health. [0] spent time recovering at the house of Stella's friend Violet Dickinson, and at [0]'s aunt Caroline's house in Cambridge, and by January 1905, her father's friend, the eminent psychiatrist George Savage considered [0] \"cured\". Stella's friend Violet Dickinson became one of [0]'s closest friends and one of [0]'s more effective nurses. [0] characterised it as a \"romantic friendship\" (Letter to Stella's friend Violet Dickinson 4 May 1903).[ae] [0]'s brother Thoby's death in 1906 marked a \"decade of deaths\" that ended [0]'s childhood and adolescence. Gordon (2004) writes: \"Ghostly voices spoke to [0] with increasing urgency, perhaps more real than the people who lived by [0]'s side. When voices of the dead urged [0] to impossible things, voices of the dead drove [0] mad but, controlled, voices of the dead became the material of fiction...\"On her father's friend, the eminent psychiatrist George Savage's recommendation, [0] spent three short periods in 1910, 1912, and 1913 at Burley House at 15 Cambridge Park, Twickenham (see image), described as \"a private nursing home for women with nervous disorder\" run by Miss Jean Thomas. By the end of February 1910, [0] was becoming increasingly restless, and her father's friend, the eminent psychiatrist George Savage suggested being away from London. [0] rented Moat House, outside Canterbury, in June, but there was no improvement, so her father's friend, the eminent psychiatrist George Savage sent [0] to Burley for a \"rest cure\". a \"rest cure\" involved partial isolation, deprivation of literature, and force-feeding, and after six weeks [0] was able to convalesce in Cornwall and Dorset during the autumn.[0] loathed the experience; writing to [0]'s sister on 28 July, [0] described how [0] found the phony religious atmosphere stifling and Burley ugly, and informed [0] that to escape \"[0] shall soon have to jump out of a window.\" The threat of being sent back would later lead to [0]'s contemplating suicide. Despite [0]'s protests, her father's friend, the eminent psychiatrist George Savage would refer [0] back in 1912 for insomnia and in 1913 for depression.On emerging from Burley in September 1913, [0] sought further opinions from two other physicians on the 13th: Maurice Wright, and Henry Head, who had been Henry James's physician. two other physicians on the 13th: Maurice Wright, and Henry Head, who had been Henry James's physician recommended [0] return to Burley. Distraught, [0] returned home and attempted suicide by taking an overdose of 100 grains of veronal (a barbiturate) and nearly dying: [0] was found by Ka Cox, who summoned help.On recovery, [0] went to Dalingridge Hall, George Duckworth's home in East Grinstead, Sussex, to convalesce on 30 September, accompanied by Ka Cox, who summoned help and a nurse, returning to Asham on 18 November with Ka Cox, who summoned help and Janet Case. [0] remained unstable over the next two years, with another incident involving veronal that [0] claimed was an \"accident\", and consulted another psychiatrist in April 1914, Maurice Craig, who explained that [0] was not sufficiently psychotic to be certified or committed to an institution.The rest of the summer of 1914 went better for [0], and the family moved to Richmond, but in February 1915, just as The Voyage Out was due to be published, [0] relapsed once more, and remained in poor health for most of 1915. Then, despite Miss Jean Thomas's gloomy prognosis, [0] began to recover, following 20 years of ill health. Nevertheless, there was a feeling among those around [0] that [0] was now permanently changed, and not for the better.Over the rest of her life, [0] suffered recurrent bouts of depression. In 1940, a number of factors appeared to overwhelm [0]. Her biography of Roger Fry had been published in July, and [0] had been disappointed in Her biography of Roger Fry's reception. The horrors of war depressed [0], and the family's London homes had been destroyed in the Blitz in September and October. [0] had completed Between the Acts (published posthumously in 1941) in November, and completing a novel was frequently accompanied by exhaustion. [0]'s health became increasingly a matter of concern, culminating in [0]'s decision to end her life on 28 March 1941.Though this instability would frequently affect [0]'s social life, [0] was able to continue [0]'s literary productivity with few interruptions throughout her life. [0] provides not only a vivid picture of [0]'s symptoms in [0]'s diaries and letters, but also [0]'s response to the demons that haunted her and at times made her long for death: \"But it is always a question whether [0] wish to avoid the demons that haunted her and at times made her long for death... These 9 weeks give one a plunge into deep waters... One goes down into the well & nothing protects one from the assault of truth.\"Psychiatry had little to offer [0], but [0] recognised that writing was one of the behaviours that enabled [0] to cope with Woolf's mental health: \"The only way [0] keep afloat... is by working... Directly [0] stop working [0] feel that [0] am sinking down, down. And as usual, [0] feel that if [0] sink further [0] shall reach the truth.\" Sinking under water was [0]'s metaphor for both the effects of depression and psychosis\u2014 but also for finding truth, and ultimately was [0]'s choice of death.Throughout her life, [0] struggled, without success, to find meaning in Woolf's mental health: on the one hand, an impediment, on the other, something [0] visualised as an essential part of who [0] was, and a necessary condition of [0]'s art. [0]'s experiences informed [0]'s work, such as the character of Septimus Warren Smith in Mrs Dalloway (1925), who, like [0], was haunted by the dead, and ultimately takes his own life rather than be admitted to a sanitorium.Leonard Woolf relates how during the 30 years the family were married, the family consulted many doctors in the Harley Street area, and although the family were given a diagnosis of neurasthenia, Leonard Woolf felt the family had little understanding of the causes or nature. The proposed solution was simple\u2014as long as [0] lived a quiet life without any physical or mental exertion, [0] was well. On the other hand, any mental, emotional, or physical strain resulted in a reappearance of her symptoms, beginning with a headache, followed by insomnia and thoughts that started to race. [0]'s remedy was simple: to retire to bed in a darkened room, eat, and drink plenty of milk, following which her symptoms slowly subsided.Modern scholars, including [0]'s nephew and biographer, Quentin Bell, have suggested [0]'s breakdowns and subsequent recurring depressive periods were influenced by the sexual abuse which she and her sister Vanessa were subjected to by she and her sister Vanessa's half-brothers George and Gerald Duckworth (which [0] recalls in [0]'s autobiographical essays \"A Sketch of the Past\" and \"22 Hyde Park Gate\") (see Sexual abuse). Biographers point out that when her mother died in 1897, there was no counterbalance to control George's predation, and George's nighttime prowling. [0] describes George as [0]'s first lover, \"The old ladies of Kensington and Belgravia never knew that George was not only father and mother, brother and sister to she and her sister Vanessa; George was she and her sister Vanessa's lover also.\"It is likely that other factors also played a part. It has been suggested that other factors include genetic predisposition, for both trauma and family history have been implicated in bipolar disorder. [0]'s father, Leslie Stephen, suffered from depression, and [0]'s half-sister Laura was institutionalised. Many of [0]'s symptoms, including persistent headache, insomnia, irritability, and anxiety, resembled those of her father's. Another factor is the pressure [0] placed upon [0] in [0]'s work; for instance, [0]'s breakdown of 1913 was at least partly triggered by the need to finish The Voyage Out.[0] hinted that Woolf's mental health was related to how [0] saw the repressed position of women in society when [0] wrote  A Room of One's Own. In A Room of One's Own, [0] asserts that, had Shakespeare had a sister of equal genius, Shakespeare \"would certainly have gone crazed, shot Shakespeare, or ended Shakespeare's days in some lonely cottage outside the village, half witch, half wizard, feared and mocked at\". These inspirations emerged from what [0] referred to as her lava of madness, describing [0]'s time at Burley in a 1930 letter to Ethel Smyth:As an experience, madness is terrific [0] can assure Ethel Smyth, and not to be sniffed at; and in her lava of madness [0] still find most of the things [0] write about. madness shoots out of one everything shaped, final, not in mere driblets, as sanity does. And the six months\u2014not three\u2014that [0] lay in bed taught [0] a good deal about what is called oneself.  Thomas Caramagno and others, in discussing Woolf's mental health, oppose the \"neurotic-genius\" way of looking at mental illness, where creativity and mental illness are conceptualised as linked rather than antithetical. Stephen Trombley describes [0] as having a confrontational relationship with [0]'s doctors, and possibly being a woman who is a \"victim of male medicine\", referring to the lack of understanding, particularly at the time, about mental illness.", "Death": "[0] is our person to focus on. After completing the manuscript of [0]'s last novel (posthumously published), Between the Acts (1941), [0] fell into a depression similar to one which [0] had earlier experienced. The onset of World War II, the destruction of [0]'s London home during the Blitz, and the cool reception given to [0]'s biography of [0]'s late friend Roger Fry all worsened [0]'s condition until [0] was unable to work. When Leonard enlisted in the Home Guard, [0] disapproved. [0] held fast to [0]'s pacifism and criticised [0]'s for wearing what [0] considered to be \"the silly uniform of the Home Guard.After World War II began, [0]'s diary indicates that [0] was obsessed with death, which figured more and more as [0]'s mood darkened. On 28 March 1941, [0] drowned [0] by filling [0]'s overcoat pockets with stones and walking into the River Ouse near [0]'s home. Her body was not found until 18 April. [0]'s buried Her body beneath an elm tree in the garden of Monk's House, their's home in Rodmell, Sussex.In her suicide note, addressed to her husband, [0] wrote:Dearest,[0] feel certain that [0] am going mad again. [0] feel their can't go through another of those terrible times. And [0] shan't recover this time. [0] begin to hear voices, and [0] can't concentrate. So [0] am doing what seems the best thing to do. Dearest have given [0] the greatest possible happiness. Dearest have been in every way all that anyone could be. [0] don't think two people could have been happier till this terrible disease came. [0] can't fight this terrible disease any longer. [0] know that [0] am spoiling your life, that without [0] Dearest could work. And Dearest will Dearest know. Dearest see [0] can't even write her suicide note, addressed to her husband properly. [0] can't read. What [0] want to say is [0] owe all the happiness of your life to Dearest. Dearest have been entirely patient with [0] and incredibly good. [0] want to say owe\u2014everybody knows it. If anybody could have saved [0] anybody would have been Dearest. Everything has gone from [0] but the certainty of Dearest's goodness. [0] can't go on spoiling your life any longer. [0] don't think two people could have been happier than their have been. V.  ", "": ""}, "Work": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] is considered to be one of the more important 20th century novelists. A modernist, [0] was one of the pioneers of using stream of consciousness as a narrative device, alongside contemporaries such as Marcel Proust, Dorothy Richardson and James Joyce. Woolf's reputation was at Woolf's reputation's greatest during the 1930s, but declined considerably following World War II. The growth of feminist criticism in the 1970s helped re-establish [0]'s reputation.[0] submitted her first article in 1890, to a competition in Tit-Bits. Although her first article was rejected, her first article would presage [0]'s first novel 25 years later, as would contributions to the Hyde Park News, such as the model letter \"to show young people the right way to express what is in young people's hearts\", a subtle commentary on [0]'s mother's legendary matchmaking. [0] transitioned from juvenilia to professional journalism in 1904 at the age of 22. Violet Dickinson introduced [0] to Mrs. Lyttelton, the editor of the Women's Supplement of The Guardian, a Church of England newspaper. Invited to submit a 1,500-word article, [0] sent Mrs. Lyttelton, the editor of the Women's Supplement of The Guardian, a Church of England newspaper a review of William Dean Howells' The Son of Royal Langbirth and an essay about her visit to Haworth 1904, Haworth, November 1904. a review of William Dean Howells' The Son of Royal Langbirth was published anonymously on 4 December, and an essay about her visit to Haworth on the 21st. In 1905, [0] began writing for The Times Literary Supplement.[0] would go on to publish novels and essays as a public intellectual to both critical and popular acclaim. Much of [0]'s work was self-published through the Hogarth Press. \"[0]'s peculiarities as a fiction writer have tended to obscure [0]'s central strength: [0] is arguably the major lyrical novelist in the English language. Her novels are highly experimental: a narrative, frequently uneventful and commonplace, is refracted\u2014and sometimes almost dissolved\u2014in the characters' receptive consciousness. Intense lyricism and stylistic virtuosity fuse to create a world overabundant with auditory and visual impressions.\" \"The intensity of [0]'s poetic vision elevates the ordinary, sometimes banal settings\"\u2014often wartime environments\u2014\"of most of Her novels.\"", "Fiction and drama": "[0] is our person to focus on. Her first novel, The Voyage Out, was published in 1915 at the age of 33, by [0]'s half-brother's imprint, Gerald Duckworth and Company Ltd. Her first novel, The Voyage Out, was originally titled Melymbrosia, but [0] repeatedly changed the draft. An earlier version of Her first novel, The Voyage Out, has been reconstructed by Woolf scholar Louise DeSalvo and is now available to the public under the intended title. Woolf scholar Louise DeSalvo argues that many of the changes [0] made in the draft were in response to changes in [0]'s own life. Her first novel, The Voyage Out, is set on a ship bound for South America, and a group of young Edwardians onboard and a group of young Edwardians onboard's various mismatched yearnings and misunderstandings. In Her first novel, The Voyage Out, are hints of themes that would emerge in later work, including the gap between preceding thought and the spoken word that follows, and the lack of concordance between expression and underlying intention, together with how the gap between preceding thought and the spoken word that follows, and the lack of concordance between expression and underlying intention reveal to us aspects of the nature of love.\"Mrs Dalloway (1925) centres on the efforts of Clarissa Dalloway, a middle-aged society woman, to organise a party, even as Clarissa Dalloway, a middle-aged society woman's life is paralleled with that of Septimus Warren Smith, a working-class veteran who has returned from the First World War bearing deep psychological scars\".\"To the Lighthouse (1927) is set on two days ten years apart. The plot centres on the Ramsay family's anticipation of and reflection upon a visit to a lighthouse and the connected familial tensions. One of the primary themes of the novel is the struggle in the creative process that beset painter Lily Briscoe while painter Lily Briscoe struggles to paint in the midst of the family drama. the novel is also a meditation upon the lives of a nation's inhabitants in the midst of war, and of the people left behind.\" the novel also explores the passage of time, and how women are forced by society to allow men to take emotional strength from women.Orlando: A Biography (1928) is one of [0]'s lightest novels. A parodic biography of a young nobleman who lives for three centuries without ageing much past thirty (but who does abruptly turn into a woman), A parodic biography of a young nobleman who lives for three centuries without ageing much past thirty (but who does abruptly turn into a woman) is in part a portrait of Woolf's lover Vita Sackville-West. A parodic biography of a young nobleman who lives for three centuries without ageing much past thirty (but who does abruptly turn into a woman) was meant to console Woolf's lover Vita Sackville-West for the loss of Woolf's lover Vita Sackville-West's ancestral home, Knole House, though A parodic biography of a young nobleman who lives for three centuries without ageing much past thirty (but who does abruptly turn into a woman) is also a satirical treatment of Woolf's lover Vita Sackville-West and Woolf's lover Vita Sackville-West's work. In A parodic biography of a young nobleman who lives for three centuries without ageing much past thirty (but who does abruptly turn into a woman), the techniques of historical biographers are being ridiculed; the character of a pompous biographer is being assumed for the character of a pompous biographer to be mocked.\"The Waves (1931) presents a group of six friends whose reflections, which are closer to recitatives than to interior monologues proper, create a wave-like atmosphere that is more akin to a prose poem than to a plot-centred novel\".Flush: A Biography (1933) is a part-fiction, part-biography of the cocker spaniel owned by Victorian poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning. Flush: A Biography (1933) is written from the cocker spaniel owned by Victorian poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning's point of view. [0] was inspired to write Flush: A Biography (1933) from the success of the Rudolf Besier play The Barretts of Wimpole Street. In the Rudolf Besier play The Barretts of Wimpole Street, the cocker spaniel owned by Victorian poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning is on stage for much of the action.The Years (1936), traces the history of the genteel Pargiter family from the 1880s to the \"present day\" of the mid-1930s. The Years (1936) had The Years (1936)'s origin in a lecture Woolf gave to the National Society for Women's Service in 1931, an edited version of which would later be published as \"Professions for Women\". [0] first thought of making a lecture Woolf gave to the National Society for Women's Service in 1931, an edited version of which would later be published as \"Professions for Women\" the basis of a new book-length essay on women, this time taking a broader view of women's economic and social life, rather than focusing on women as artists, as the first book had. [0] soon jettisoned the theoretical framework of [0]'s \"novel-essay\" and began to rework A parodic biography of a young nobleman who lives for three centuries without ageing much past thirty (but who does abruptly turn into a woman) solely as a fictional narrative, but some of the non-fiction material [0] first intended for The Years (1936) was later used in Three Guineas (1938).\"Her last work, Between the Acts (1941), sums up and magnifies [0]'s chief preoccupations: the transformation of life through art, sexual ambivalence, and meditation on the themes of flux of time and life, presented simultaneously as corrosion and rejuvenation\u2014all set in a highly imaginative and symbolic narrative encompassing almost all of English history.\" A parodic biography of a young nobleman who lives for three centuries without ageing much past thirty (but who does abruptly turn into a woman) is the most lyrical of all [0]'s works, not only in feeling but in style, being chiefly written in verse. While [0]'s work can be understood as consistently in dialogue with the Bloomsbury Group, particularly the Bloomsbury Group's tendency (informed by G.E. Moore, among others) towards doctrinaire rationalism, A parodic biography of a young nobleman who lives for three centuries without ageing much past thirty (but who does abruptly turn into a woman) is not a simple recapitulation of the coterie's ideals.Woolf's fiction has been studied for Woolf's fiction's insight into many themes including war, shell shock, witchcraft, and the role of social class in contemporary modern British society. In the postwar Mrs Dalloway (1925), [0] addresses the moral dilemma of war and war's effects and provides an authentic voice for soldiers returning from the First World War, suffering from shell shock, in the person of Septimus Smith. In A Room of One's Own (1929) [0] equates historical accusations of witchcraft with creativity and genius among women \"When, however, one reads of a witch being ducked, of a woman possessed by devils...then [0] think we are on the track of a lost novelist, a suppressed poet, of some mute and inglorious Jane Austen\". Throughout [0]'s work [0] tried to evaluate the degree to which [0]'s privileged background framed the lens through which [0] viewed class. [0] both examined [0]'s own position as someone who would be considered an elitist snob, but attacked the class structure of Britain as she found itthe class structure of Britain as she found it. In [0]'s 1936 essay Am [0] a Snob?, [0] examined [0]'s values and those of the privileged circle [0] existed in. [0] concluded [0] was, and subsequent critics and supporters have tried to deal with the dilemma of being both elite and a social critic.The sea is a recurring motif in [0]'s work. Noting [0]'s early memory of listening to waves break in Cornwall, Katharine Smyth writes in The Paris Review that \"the radiance [of] cresting water would be consecrated again and again in her writing, saturating not only essays, diaries, and letters but also Jacob's Room, The Waves, and To a lighthouse.\" Patrizia A. Muscogiuri explains that \"seascapes, sailing, diving and the sea itself the sea itself are aspects of nature and of human beings' relationship with nature which frequently inspired her writing.\" This trope is deeply embedded in her texts''s structure and grammar; James Antoniou notes in Sydney Morning Herald how \"[0] made a virtue of the semicolon, the shape and function of which resembles the wave, [0]'s most famous motif.\"Despite the considerable conceptual difficulties, given [0]'s idiosyncratic use of language, her texts' have been translated into over 50 languages. Some writers, such as the Belgian Marguerite Yourcenar, had rather tense encounters with [0], while others, such as the Argentinian Jorge Luis Borges, produced versions that were highly controversial.[0] researched the life of her great-aunt, the photographer Julia Margaret Cameron, publishing [0]'s findings in an essay titled \"Pattledom\" (1925), and later in [0]'s introduction to [0]'s 1926 edition of her great-aunt, the photographer Julia Margaret Cameron's photographs. [0] had begun work on a play based on an episode in Cameron's life the life of her great-aunt, the photographer Julia Margaret Cameron in 1923, but abandoned a play based on an episode in Cameron's life. Finally a play based on an episode in Cameron's life was performed on 18 January 1935 at the studio of [0]'s sister, Vanessa Bell on Fitzroy Street in 1935. [0] directed a play based on an episode in Cameron's life [0], and the cast were mainly members of the Bloomsbury Group, including [0]. a play based on an episode in Cameron's life is a short three act comedy satirising the Victorian era, only performed once in [0]'s lifetime. Beneath the comedic elements, there is an exploration of both generational change and artistic freedom. Both her great-aunt, the photographer Julia Margaret Cameron and [0] fought against the class and gender dynamics of Victorianism and a play based on an episode in Cameron's life shows links to both To a lighthouse and A Room of One's Own that would follow.", "Non-fiction": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] wrote a body of autobiographical work and more than 500 essays and reviews, some of which, like A Room of One's Own (1929) were of book length. Not all were published in [0]'s lifetime. Shortly after [0]'s death, [0] produced an edited edition of unpublished essays titled The Moment and other Essays, published by the Hogarth Press in 1947. Many of more than 500 essays and reviews were originally lectures that [0] gave, and several more volumes of essays followed, such as The Captain's Death Bed: and other essays (1950).Among [0]'s non-fiction works, one of the best known is A Room of One's Own (1929). Considered a key work of feminist literary criticism, A Room of One's Own (1929) was written following two lectures [0] delivered on \"Women and Fiction\" at Cambridge University the previous year. In A Room of One's Own (1929), [0] examines the historical disempowerment women have faced in many spheres, including social, educational and financial. One of [0]'s more famous dicta is contained within the book \"A woman must have money and a room of A woman's own if A woman is to write fiction\". Much of [0]'s argument (\"to show you how [0] arrived at this opinion about the room and the money\") is developed through the \"unsolved problems\" of women and fiction writing to arrive at her conclusion, although [0] claimed her conclusion was only \"an opinion upon one minor point\". In doing so, [0] states a good deal about the nature of women and fiction, employing a quasi-fictional style as [0] examines where women writers failed because of lack of resources and opportunities, examining along the way the experiences of the Bront\u00ebs, George Eliot and George Sand, as well as the fictional character of Shakespeare's sister, equipped with the same genius but not position. [0] contrasted these women who accepted a deferential status with Jane Austen, who wrote entirely as a woman.", "Influences": "[0] is our person to focus on. Michel Lackey argues that a major influence on [0], from 1912 onward, was Russian literature and [0] adopted many of Russian literature's aesthetic conventions. The style of Fyodor Dostoyevsky with Fyodor Dostoyevsky's depiction of a fluid mind in operation helped to influence [0]'s writings about a \"discontinuous writing process\", though [0] objected to Fyodor Dostoyevsky's obsession with \"psychological extremity\" and the \"tumultuous flux of emotions\" in Fyodor Dostoyevsky's characters together with Fyodor Dostoyevsky's right-wing, monarchist politics as Fyodor Dostoyevsky was an ardent supporter of the autocracy of the Russian Empire. In contrast to [0]'s objections to Fyodor Dostoyevsky's \"exaggerated emotional pitch\", [0] found much to admire in the work of Anton Chekhov and Leo Tolstoy. [0] admired Anton Chekhov for Anton Chekhov's stories of ordinary people living ordinary people's lives, doing banal things and plots that had no neat endings. From Leo Tolstoy, [0] drew lessons about how a novelist should depict a character's psychological state and the interior tension within. Michel Lackey notes that, from Ivan Turgenev, [0] drew the lessons that there are multiple \"I's\" when writing a novel, and the novelist needed to balance multiple \"I's\" to balance the \"mundane facts\" of a story vs. the writer's overarching vision, which required a \"total passion\" for art.The American writer Henry David Thoreau also influenced [0]. In a 1917 essay, [0] praised The American writer Henry David Thoreau for The American writer Henry David Thoreau's statement \"The millions are awake enough for physical labor, but only one in hundreds of millions is awake enough to a poetic or divine life. To be awake is to be alive.\" They both aimed to capture 'the moment'\u2013\u2013as Walter Pater says, \"to burn always with this hard, gem-like flame.\"  [0] praised The American writer Henry David Thoreau for The American writer Henry David Thoreau's \"simplicity\" in finding \"a way for setting free the delicate and complicated machinery of the soul\". Like The American writer Henry David Thoreau, [0] believed that it was silence that set the mind free to really contemplate and understand the world. They both believed in a certain transcendental, mystical approach to life and writing, where even banal things could be capable of generating deep emotions if one had enough silence and the presence of mind to appreciate even banal things. They both The American writer Henry David Thoreau were both concerned with the difficulty of human relationships in the modern age.[0]'s preface to Orlando credits Daniel Defoe, Sir Thomas Browne, Laurence Sterne, Sir Walter Scott, Lord Macaulay, Emily Bront\u00eb, Thomas de Quincey, and Walter Pater as influences. Among [0]'s contemporaries, [0] was influenced by Marcel Proust, writing to Roger Fry, \"Oh if [0] could write like Marcel Proust!\"", "List of selected publications": ""}, "Views": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. In [0]'s lifetime, [0] was outspoken on many topics that were considered controversial, some of which are now considered progressive, others regressive. [0] was an ardent feminist at a time when women's rights were barely recognised, and anti-colonialist, anti-imperialist and a pacifist when chauvinism was popular. On the other hand, [0] has been criticised for views on class and race in [0]'s private writings and published works. Like many of [0]'s contemporaries, some of [0]'s writing is now considered offensive. As a result, [0] is considered polarising, a revolutionary feminist and socialist hero or a purveyor of hate speech.Works such as A Room of One's Own (1929) and Three Guineas (1938) are frequently taught as icons of feminist literature in courses that would be very critical of some of [0]'s views expressed elsewhere. [0] has also been the recipient of considerable homophobic and misogynist criticism.", "Humanist views": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was born into a non-religious family and is regarded, along with [0]'s fellow Bloomsberries E.M. Forster and G.E. Moore, as a humanist. Both [0]'s parents were prominent agnostic atheists. Her father, Leslie Stephen, had become famous in polite society for Her father, Leslie Stephen,'s writings which expressed and publicised reasons to doubt the veracity of religion. Her father, Leslie Stephen, was also President of the West London Ethical Society, an early humanist organisation, and helped to found the Union of Ethical Societies in 1896. [0]'s mother, Julia Stephen, wrote the book Agnostic Women (1880), which argued that agnosticism (defined here as something more like atheism) could be a highly moral approach to life.[0] was a critic of Christianity. In a letter to Ethel Smyth, [0] gave a scathing denunciation of Christianity, seeing Christianity as self-righteous \"egotism\" and stating \"[0]'s Jew [Leonard] has more religion in one toenail\u2014more human love, in one hair\". [0] stated in [0]'s private letters that [0] thought of [0] as an atheist.[0] thought there were no Gods; no one was to blame; and so [0] evolved an atheist's religion of doing good for the sake of goodness. ", "Controversies": "[0] is our person to focus on. Hermione Lee cites a number of extracts from [0]'s writings that many, including Hermione Lee, would consider offensive, and these criticisms can be traced back as far as those of Wyndham Lewis and Q.D. Leavis in the 1920s and 1930s. Other authors provide more nuanced contextual interpretations, and stress the complexity of [0]'s character and the apparent inherent contradictions in analysing [0]'s apparent flaws. [0] could certainly be off-hand, rude and even cruel in [0]'s dealings with other authors, translators and biographers, such as [0]'s treatment of Ruth Gruber[citation needed]. Some authors, including David Daiches, Brenda Silver, Alison Light and other postcolonial feminists, dismiss [0] (and modernist authors in general) as privileged, elitist, classist, racist, and antisemitic.[0]'s tendentious expressions, including prejudicial feelings against disabled people, have often been the topic of academic criticism: The first quotation is from a diary entry of September 1920 and runs: \"The fact is the lower classes are detestable.\" The remainder follow The first quotation in reproducing stereotypes standard to upper-class and upper-middle class life in the early 20th century: \"imbeciles should certainly be killed\"; \"Jews\" are greasy; a \"crowd\" is both an ontological \"mass\" and is, again, \"detestable\"; \"Germans\" are akin to vermin; some \"baboon faced intellectuals\" mix with \"sad green dressed negroes and negresses, looking like chimpanzees\" at a peace conference; Kensington High St. revolts one's stomach with Kensington High St.'s innumerable \"women of incredible mediocrity, drab as dishwater\". ", "Antisemitism": "[0] is our person to focus on. Often accused of antisemitism, the treatment of Judaism and Jews by [0] is far from straightforward. [0] was happily married to an irreligious Jewish man (Leonard Woolf) who had no connection with or knowledge of his people an irreligious Jewish man (Leonard Woolf) who had no connection with or knowledge of his people's while [0] generally characterized Jewish characters with negative stereotypes. For instance, [0] described some of the Jewish characters in her work in terms that suggested some of the Jewish characters in her work were physically repulsive or dirty. On the other hand, [0] could criticise [0]'s own views: \"How [0] hated marrying a Jew \u2014 how [0] hated a Jew's nasal voices and a Jew's oriental jewellery, and a Jew's noses and a Jew's wattles \u2014 what a snob [0] was: for a Jew have immense vitality, and [0] think [0] like immense vitality best of all\" (Letter to Ethel Smyth 1930). These attitudes have been construed to reflect, not so much antisemitism, but social status; [0] married outside [0]'s social class. an irreligious Jewish man (Leonard Woolf) who had no connection with or knowledge of his people lacked the material status of the Stephens and the Stephens's circle.While travelling on a cruise to Portugal, [0] protested at finding \"a great many Portuguese Jews on board, and other repulsive objects, but we keep clear of a great many Portuguese Jews\". Furthermore, [0] wrote in [0]'s diary: \"[0] do not like the Jewish voice; [0] do not like the Jewish laugh.\" Her 1938 short story, written during Hitler's reign, The Duchess and the Jeweller (originally titled The Duchess and the Jew) has been considered antisemitic.Some believe that [0] and an irreligious Jewish man (Leonard Woolf) who had no connection with or knowledge of his people came to despise and fear the 1930s fascism and antisemitism. [0]'s 1938 book Three Guineas was an indictment of fascism and what [0] described as a recurring propensity among patriarchal societies to enforce repressive societal mores by violence. And yet, Her 1938 short story, written during Hitler's reign, The Duchess and the Jeweller (originally titled The Duchess and the Jew) was so deep in Her 1938 short story, written during Hitler's reign, The Duchess and the Jeweller (originally titled The Duchess and the Jew)'s hateful depiction of Jews that Harper's Bazaar asked [0] to modify Her 1938 short story, written during Hitler's reign, The Duchess and the Jeweller (originally titled The Duchess and the Jew) before publication. [0] reluctantly complied."}, "Sexuality": {"": "Virginia Woolf is our person to focus on. [0] held very progressive views regarding sexuality and rejected the austere strictness of Victorian society. The majority of [0]'s members were homosexual or bisexual.Virginia Woolf had several affairs with women, the most notable being with Vita Sackville-West. The two women developed a deep connection; Vita Sackville-West was arguably one of the few people in Virginia Woolf's adult life that Virginia Woolf was truly close to.[Virginia Woolf] told Ethel that Virginia Woolf only really loved three people: Leonard, Vanessa, and Vita Sackville-West, which annoyed Ethel but pleased Vita Sackville-West \u2013 Vita Sackville-West's letter to husband Harold Nicolson, dated 28 September 1939 During The two women's relationship, The two women saw the peak of The two women's literary careers, with the titular protagonist of Virginia Woolf's acclaimed Orlando: A Biography being inspired by Vita Sackville-West. The two women remained lovers for a decade and stayed close friends for the rest of Virginia Woolf's life. Virginia Woolf had said to Vita Sackville-West Virginia Woolf disliked masculinity.[Virginia Woolf] dislikes the possessiveness and love of domination in men. In fact Virginia Woolf dislikes the quality of masculinity\u00a0; says that women stimulate Virginia Woolf's imagination, by women's grace & women's art of life \u2013 Vita Sackville-West's diary, dated 26 September 1928 Among Virginia Woolf's other notable affairs were those with Sibyl Colefax, Lady Ottoline Morrell, and Mary Hutchinson. Some surmise that Virginia Woolf may have fallen in love with Madge Symonds, the wife of one of her uncles. Madge Symonds, the wife of one of her uncles was described as one of Virginia Woolf's early loves in Vita Sackville-West's diary, dated 26 September 1928. Virginia Woolf also fell in love with Violet Dickinson, although there is some confusion as to whether the two consummated the two's relationship.In regards to relationships with men, Virginia Woolf was averse to sex with men, blaming the sexual abuse perpetrated upon her and her sister by Virginia Woolf's half-brothers when her and her sister were children and teens. This is one of the reasons Virginia Woolf initially declined marriage proposals from Virginia Woolf's . Virginia Woolf even went as far as to tell Leonard that Virginia Woolf was not attracted to Leonard, but that Virginia Woolf did love Leonard and finally agreed to marriage. Virginia Woolf preferred female lovers to male lovers, for the most part, based on her aversion to sex with men. her aversion to sex with men influenced Virginia Woolf writing especially when considering Virginia Woolf's sexual abuse as a child.Virginia Woolf sometimes think that if Virginia Woolf married Leonard, Virginia Woolf could have everything\u2014and then\u2014is it the sexual side of it that comes between The two women? As Virginia Woolf told Leonard brutally the other day, Virginia Woolf feel no physical attraction in Leonard. \u2013 Letter to Leonard from Virginia dated May 1, 1912Leonard became the love of Virginia Woolf's life and, even though The two women's sexual relationship was questionable, The two women loved each other deeply and formed a strong and supportive marriage that led to the formation of The two women's publishing house as well as several of Virginia Woolf's writings. Neither was faithful to the other sexually, but The two women were faithful in The two women's love and respect for each other."}, "Modern scholarship and interpretations": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. Though at least one biography of [0] appeared in [0]'s lifetime, the first authoritative study of her life was published in 1972 by [0]'s nephew Quentin Bell. Hermione Lee's's 1996 biography Virginia Woolf provides a thorough and authoritative examination of [0]'s life and work, which Hermione Lee's discussed in an interview in 1997. In 2001, Louise DeSalvo and Mitchell A. Leaska edited The Letters of Vita Sackville-West and [0]. Julia Briggs's Virginia Woolf: An Inner Life (2005) focuses on [0]'s writing, including [0]'s novels and [0]'s commentary on the creative process, to illuminate her life. The sociologist Pierre Bourdieu also uses [0]'s literature to understand and analyse gender domination. [0] biographer Gillian Gill notes that [0]'s traumatic experience of sexual abuse by [0]'s half-brothers during [0]'s childhood influenced [0]'s advocacy of protection of vulnerable children from similar experiences.

The intense scrutiny of [0]'s literary output (see Bibliography) has led to speculation as to her mother's's influence, including psychoanalytic studies of mother and daughter. [0] states that, \"my first memory, and in fact my first memory is the most important of all [0]'s memories\" is of her mother's. [0]'s memories of her mother's are memories of an obsession, starting with [0]'s first major breakdown on her mother's's death in 1895, the loss having a profound lifelong effect. In many ways, her mother's's profound influence on [0] is conveyed in [0]'s recollections, \"there her mother's is; beautiful, emphatic ... closer than any of the living are, lighting our random lives as with a burning torch, infinitely noble and delightful to her mother's's children\".[0] described her mother's as an \"invisible presence\" in [0]'s life, and Ellen Rosenman argues that the mother-daughter relationship is a constant in [0]'s writing. Ellen Rosenman describes how [0]'s modernism needs to be viewed in relationship to [0]'s ambivalence towards her mother's, and [0]'s voyage to [0]'s own sense of autonomy. To [0], her mother's was both a martyr whose perfectionism was intimidating and a source of deprivation, by her mother's's absences real and virtual and premature death. her mother's's influence and memory pervades [0]'s life and work. \"her mother's has haunted [0]\", [0] wrote.", "Historical feminism": "[0] is our person to focus on.

In The Second Sex (1949), Simone de Beauvoir counts, of all women who ever lived, only three female writers\u2014Emily Bront\u00eb, [0] and \"sometimes\" Katherine Mansfield\u2014 have explored \"the given\"."}, "In popular culture": {"Adaptations": "Virginia Woolf is our person to focus on.
