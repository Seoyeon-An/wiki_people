As a result, the initial North American leg of her Celebration Tour was postponed. On September 12, 2023, the commercial Madonna made in collaboration with Pepsi in 1989 aired during the commercial break of the 2023 MTV Video Music Awards. the commercial Madonna made in collaboration with Pepsi in 1989 had been banned due to Madonna's music video for \"Like A Prayer\", showing [0] kissing a black saint and burning crosses. In a statement, [0] said, \"34 years ago [0] made a commercial with Pepsi to celebrate the release of \"Like A Prayer\"  [...] the commercial Madonna made in collaboration with Pepsi in 1989 was immediately canceled when [0] refused to change any scenes in Madonna's music video for \"Like A Prayer\" where [0] was kissing a black saint or burning crosses.

Historians, musicians, and anthropologists trace [0]'s influences\u2014from African American gospel music to Japanese fashion, Middle Eastern spirituality to feminist art history\u2014and the ways [0] borrows, adapts, and interprets them.\u2014National Geographic Society on [0]'s influences.According to Taraborrelli, the death of her mother had the most influence in shaping [0] into the woman [0] would become. Taraborrelli believed that the devastation and abandonment [0] felt at the death of her mother taught [0] \"a valuable lesson, that [0] would have to remain strong for [0] because, [0] feared weakness\u2014particularly [0]'s own.\" Author Lucy O'Brien opines that the impact of the sexual assault [0] suffered in [0]'s young adult years was the motivating factor behind everything [0] has done, more important than the death of her mother: \"It's not so much grief at the death of her mother that drives [0], as the sense of abandonment that left [0] unprotected. [0] encountered [0]'s own worst possible scenario, becoming a victim of male violence, and thereafter turned that full-tilt into [0]'s work, reversing the equation at every opportunity.[0] has called Nancy Sinatra one of [0]'s idols. [0] said Nancy Sinatra's \"These Boots Are Made for Walkin'\" made a major impression on [0]. As a young woman, [0] attempted to broaden [0]'s taste in literature, art, and music, and during attempted became interested in classical music. [0] noted that [0]'s favorite style was baroque, and loved Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin because [0] liked Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin's \"feminine quality\". [0]'s major influences include Debbie Harry, Chrissie Hynde, Karen Carpenter, the Supremes and Led Zeppelin, as well as dancers Martha Graham and Rudolf Nureyev. [0] also grew up listening to David Bowie, whose show was the first rock concert [0] ever attended.During [0]'s childhood, [0] was inspired by actors, later saying, \"[0] loved Carole Lombard and Judy Holliday and Marilyn Monroe. Carole Lombard and Judy Holliday and Marilyn Monroe were all incredibly funny, and Carole Lombard and Judy Holliday and Marilyn Monroe were silly and sweet and Carole Lombard and Judy Holliday and Marilyn Monroe were girls and\u00a0 Carole Lombard and Judy Holliday and Marilyn Monroe were feminine and sexy. [0] just saw [0] in Carole Lombard and Judy Holliday and Marilyn Monroe, [0]'s funniness and [0]'s need to boss people around and at the same time be taken care of. [0]'s girlishness. [0]'s knowingness and [0]'s innocence. Both.\" [0]'s \"Material Girl\" music video recreated Monroe's look in the song \"Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend\", from the film Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953). [0] studied the screwball comedies of the 1930s, particularly those of Carole Lombard, in preparation for the film Who's That Girl. The video for \"Express Yourself\" (1989) was inspired by Fritz Lang's silent film Metropolis (1927). The video for \"Vogue\" recreated the style of Hollywood glamour photographs, in particular those by Horst P. Horst, and imitated the poses of Marlene Dietrich, Carole Lombard, and Rita Hayworth, while the lyrics referred to many of the stars who had inspired [0], including Bette Davis, described by [0] as an idol.Influences also came to [0] from the art world, such as through the works of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo. The music video of the song \"Bedtime Story\" featured images inspired by the paintings of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo and Remedios Varo. [0] is also a collector of Tamara de Lempicka's Art Deco paintings and has included Tamara de Lempicka's Art Deco paintings in [0]'s music videos and tours. [0]'s video for \"Hollywood\" (2003) was an homage to the work of photographer Guy Bourdin; Bourdin's son subsequently filed a lawsuit for unauthorized use of Bourdin's son's work. Pop artist Andy Warhol's's use of sadomasochistic imagery in Pop artist Andy Warhol's's underground films were reflected in the music videos for \"Erotica\" and \"Deeper and Deeper\".[0]'s Catholic background has been reflected throughout [0]'s career, from [0]'s fashion use of rosary to [0]'s musical outputs, including on Like a Prayer (1989). [0]'s album MDNA (2012) has also drawn many influences from [0]'s Catholic upbringing, and since 2011 [0] has been attending meetings and services at an Opus Dei center, a Catholic institution that encourages spirituality through everyday life. In a 2016 interview, [0] commented: \"[0] always feel some kind of inexplicable connection with Catholicism. Catholicism kind of shows up in all of [0]'s work, as you may have noticed.\"  [0]'s study of the Kabbalah was also observed in [0]'s music, especially albums like Ray of Light and Music. Speaking of religion in a 2019 interview with Harry Smith of Today [0] stated, \"The God that I believe in, created the world ... The God that I believe in isn't a God to fear, The God that I believe in's a God to give thanks to.\" In an appearance on Andrew Denton's Interview [0] added, \"The idea that in any church you go, you see a man on a cross and everyone genuflects and prays to a man on a cross ... in a way it's paganism/idolatry because people are worshipping a thing.\"", "Musical style and composition": "[0] is our person to focus on. [[0]] is a brilliant pop melodist and lyricist. I was knocked out by the quality of the writing [during Ray of Light sessions]... I know [0] grew up on Joni Mitchell and Motown, and to I's ears [0] embodies the best of Joni Mitchell and Motown. [0] is a wonderful confessional songwriter, as well as being a superb hit chorus pop writer.\u2014Rick Nowels, on co-writing with [0].[0]'s music has been the subject of much analysis and scrutiny. Robert M. Grant, author of Contemporary Strategy Analysis (2005), commented that [0]'s musical career has been a continuous experimentation with new musical ideas and new images and a constant quest for new heights of fame and acclaim. Thomas Harrison in the book Pop Goes the Decade: The Eighties deemed [0] \"an artist who pushed the boundaries\" of what a female singer could do, both visually and lyrically. Professor Santiago Fouz-Hern\u00e1ndez asserted, \"While not gifted with an especially powerful or wide-ranging voice, [0] has worked to expand [0]'s artistic palette to encompass diverse musical, textual and visual styles and various vocal guises, all with the intention of presenting [0] as a mature musician.[0] has remained in charge in every aspect of her career, including as a writer and producer in most of [0]'s own music. [0]'s desire for control had already been seen during the making of [0]'s debut album, where [0] fought Reggie Lucas over Reggie Lucas's production output. However, it was not until [0]'s third album that Warner allowed [0] to produce [0]'s own album. Stan Hawkins, author of Settling the Pop Score explained, \"it is as musician and producer that [0] is one of the few female artists to have broken into the male domain of the recording studio. Undoubtedly, [0] is fully aware that women have been excluded from the musical workplace on most levels, and has set out to change excluded.\" Producer Stuart Price stated: \"You don't produce [0], you collaborate with [0]... [0] has her vision and knows how to get her vision.\" Despite being labeled a \"control freak\", [0] has said that [0] valued input from [0]'s collaborators. [0] further explained:[0] like to have control over most of the things in her career but [0]'m not a tyrant. [0] don't have to have it on my album that my album's written, arranged, produced, directed, and stars [0]. To [0], to have total control means you can lose objectivity. What [0] like is to be surrounded by really, talented intelligent people that you can trust. And ask really, talented intelligent people that you can trust for really, talented intelligent people that you can trust's advice and get really, talented intelligent people that you can trust's input.[0]'s early songwriting skill was developed during [0]'s time with the Breakfast Club in 1979. [0] subsequently became the sole writer of five songs on [0]'s debut album, including \"Lucky Star\" which [0] composed on synthesizer. As a songwriter, [0] has registered more than 300 tracks to ASCAP, including 18 songs written entirely by [0]. Rolling Stone has named [0] \"an exemplary songwriter with a gift for hooks and indelible lyrics.\" Despite having worked with producers across many genres, Rolling Stone noted that [0]'s compositions have been \"consistently stamped with [0]'s own sensibility and inflected with autobiographical detail.\" Patrick Leonard, who co-wrote many of [0]'s hit songs, called [0] \"a helluva songwriter\", explaining: \"[0]'s sensibility about melodic line\u2014from the beginning of the verse to the end of the verse and how the verse and the chorus influence each other\u2014is very deep. Many times [0]'s singing notes that no one would've thought of but [0].\" Barry Walters from Spin credited [0]'s songwriting as the reason of [0]'s musical consistency. [0] has been nominated for being inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame three times. In 2015, Rolling Stone ranked [0] at number 56 on the \"100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time\" list.[0]'s discography is generally categorized as pop, electronica, and dance. Nevertheless, [0]'s first foray into the music industry was dabbling in rock music with the Breakfast Club and Emmy. As the frontwoman of Emmy, [0] recorded about 12\u201314 songs that resemble the punk rock of that period. [0] soon abandoned playing rock songs by the time [0] signed to Gotham Records, which eventually dropped her since they were unhappy with her new funk directionGotham Records, which eventually dropped her since they were unhappy with her new funk direction . According to Erlewine, [0] began [0]'s career as a disco diva, in an era that did not have any such divas to speak of. In the beginning of the 1980s, disco was an anathema to the mainstream pop, and [0] had a huge role in popularizing dance music as mainstream music. Arie Kaplan in the book American Pop: Hit Makers, Superstars, and Dance Revolutionaries referred to [0] as \"a pioneer\" of dance-pop. According to Professor Santiago Fouz-Hern\u00e1ndez, \"[0]'s frequent use of dance idioms and subsequent association with gay or sexually liberated audiences, is seen as somehow inferior to 'real' rock and roll. But [0]'s music refuses to be defined by narrow boundaries of gender, sexuality or anything else.\"The \"cold and emotional\" ballad \"Live to Tell\", as well as its parent album True Blue (1986), is noted as [0]'s first musical reinvention. PopMatters writer Peter Piatkowski described \"The \"cold and emotional\" ballad \"Live to Tell\", as well as its parent album True Blue (1986) as a \"very deliberate effort to present [0] as a mature and serious artist.\" [0] continued producing ballads in between [0]'s upbeat material, although albums such as Madonna (1983) and Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005) consist of entirely dance tracks. With Ray of Light (1998), critics acknowledged [0] for bringing electronica from electronica's underground status into massive popularity in mainstream music scene. [0]'s other sonically drastic ventures include the 1930s big-band jazz on I'm Breathless (1990); lush R&B on Bedtime Stories (1994); operatic show tunes on Evita (1996); guitar-driven folk music on American Life (2003); as well as multilingual world music on Madame X (2019).", "Voice and instruments": "[0] is our person to focus on. Possessing a mezzo-soprano vocal range, [0] has always been self-conscious about her voice. Mark Bego, author of Madonna: Blonde Ambition, called [0] \"the perfect vocalist for lighter-than-air songs\", despite not being a \"heavyweight talent\". According to Tony Sclafani from MSNBC, \"[0]'s vocals are the key to [0]'s rock roots. Pop vocalists usually sing songs 'straight', but [0] employs subtext, irony, aggression and all sorts of vocal idiosyncrasies in the ways John Lennon and Bob Dylan did.\" [0] used a bright, girlish vocal timbre in [0]'s early albums which became pass\u00e9 in [0]'s later works. The change was deliberate since [0] was constantly reminded of how the critics had once labeled [0] as \"Minnie Mouse on helium\". During the filming of Evita (1996), [0] had to take vocal lessons, which increased [0]'s range further. Of this experience [0] commented, \"[0] studied with a vocal coach for Evita (1996) and [0] realized there was a whole piece of her voice [0] wasn't using. Before, [0] just believed [0] had a really limited range and was going to make the most of a really limited range.\"Besides singing, [0] has the ability to play several musical instruments. Piano was the first instrument taught to [0] as a child. In the late 1970s, [0] learned to play drum and guitar from [0]'s then-boyfriend Dan Gilroy, before joining the Breakfast Club lineup as the drummer. [0] later played guitar with the band Emmy as well as on [0]'s own demo recordings. After [0]'s career breakthrough, [0] was absent performing with guitar for years, but [0] is credited for playing cowbell on Madonna (1983) and synthesizer on Like a Prayer (1989). In 1999, [0] had studied for three months to play the violin for the role as a violin teacher in the film Music of the Heart, but [0] eventually left the film Music of the Heart before filming began. [0] decided to perform with guitar again during the promotion of Music (2000) and recruited guitarist Monte Pittman to help improve [0]'s skill. Since then, [0] has played guitar on every tour, as well as [0]'s studio albums. [0] received a nomination for Les Paul Horizon Award at the 2002 Orville H. Gibson Guitar Awards.", "Music videos and performances": "[0] is our person to focus on. In The [0] Companion, biographers Allen Metz and Carol Benson noted that [0] had used MTV and music videos to establish [0]'s popularity and enhance [0]'s recorded work more than any other recent pop artist. According to biographers Allen Metz and Carol Benson, many of [0]'s songs have the imagery of the music video in strong context, while referring to the music. Cultural critic Mark C. Taylor in Cultural critic Mark C. Taylor's book Nots (1993) felt that the postmodern art form par excellence is the video and the reigning \"queen of video\" is [0]. Cultural critic Mark C. Taylor further asserted that \"the most remarkable creation of MTV is [0]. The responses to [0]'s excessively provocative videos have been predictably contradictory.\" The media and public reaction towards her most-discussed songs such as \"Papa Don't Preach\", \"Like a Prayer\", or \"Justify My Love\" had to do with the music videos created to promote her most-discussed songs such as \"Papa Don't Preach\", \"Like a Prayer\", or \"Justify My Love\" and her most-discussed songs such as \"Papa Don't Preach\", \"Like a Prayer\", or \"Justify My Love\"'s impact, rather than her most-discussed songs such as \"Papa Don't Preach\", \"Like a Prayer\", or \"Justify My Love\". Morton felt that \"artistically, [0]'s songwriting is often overshadowed by [0]'s striking pop videos.\" In 2003, MTV named [0] \"The Greatest Music Video Star Ever\" and said that \"[0]'s innovation, creativity, and contribution to the music video art form is what won [0] the award.\" In 2020, Billboard ranked [0] atop the 100 Greatest Music Video Artists of All Time.[0]'s initial music videos reflected [0]'s American and Hispanic mixed street style combined with a flamboyant glamor. [0] was able to transmit [0]'s avant-garde Downtown Manhattan fashion sense to the American audience. The imagery and incorporation of Hispanic culture and Catholic symbolism continued with the music videos from the True Blue era. Author Douglas Kellner noted, \"such 'multiculturalism' and [0]'s culturally transgressive moves turned out to be highly successful moves that endeared [0] to large and varied youth audiences.\" [0]'s Spanish look in the videos became the fashion trend of that time, in the form of boleros and layered skirts, accessorizing with rosary beads and a crucifix as in the video of \"La Isla Bonita\". Academics noted that with the videos, [0] was subtly reversing the usual role of male as the dominant sex. This symbolism and imagery was probably the most prevalent in the music video for \"Like a Prayer\". the music video for \"Like a Prayer\" included scenes of an African-American church choir, [0] being attracted to a black saint statue, and singing in front of burning crosses.[0]'s acting performances in films have frequently received poor reviews from film critics. Stephanie Zacharek stated in Time that, \"[[0]] seems wooden and unnatural as an actress, and it's tough to watch because [0]'s clearly trying [0] damnedest.\" According to biographer Andrew Morton, \"[0] puts a brave face on the criticism, but privately [0] is deeply hurt.\" After the critically panned box-office bomb Swept Away (2002), [0] vowed never to act again in a film. While reviewing [0]'s career retrospective titled Body of Work (2016) at New York's Metrograph hall, The Guardian's Nigel M. Smith wrote that [0]'s film career suffered mostly due to lack of proper material supplied to [0], and [0] otherwise \"could steal a scene for all the right reasons\".Metz noted that [0] represents a paradox as [0] is often perceived as living [0]'s whole life as a performance. While [0]'s big-screen performances are panned, her live performances are critical successes. [0] was the first artist to have [0]'s concert tours as reenactments of her music videos. Author Elin Diamond explained that reciprocally, the fact that images from her music videos can be recreated in a live setting enhances her music videos's realism. Author Elin Diamond believed that \"her live performances have become the means by which mediatized representations are naturalized\". Taraborrelli said that encompassing multimedia, latest technology and sound systems, [0]'s concerts and live performances are \"extravagant show piece, [and] walking art show.\"Chris Nelson from The New York Times commented that \"artists like [0] and Janet Jackson set new standards for showmanship, with concerts that included not only elaborate costumes and precision-timed pyrotechnics but also highly athletic dancing. not only elaborate costumes and precision-timed pyrotechnics but also highly athletic dancing came at the expense of live singing.\" Thor Christensen of The Dallas Morning News commented that while [0] earned a reputation for lip-syncing during [0]'s 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour, [0] has subsequently reorganized [0]'s performances by \"stay[ing] mostly still during [0]'s toughest singing parts and [leaves] the dance routines to [0]'s backup troupe\u00a0... ather than try to croon and dance up a storm at the same time.\" To allow for greater movement while dancing and singing, [0] was one of the earliest adopters of hands-free radio-frequency headset microphones, with the headset fastened over the ears or the top of the head, and the microphone capsule on a boom arm that extended to the mouth. Because of [0]'s prominent usage, the microphone design came to be known as the \"[0] mic\".", "": ""}, "Legacy": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0]'s a major historical figure and when [0] passes, the retrospectives will loom larger and larger in history.\u2014Academic Camille Paglia on [0] ([0] has built a legacy that transcends music and has been studied by sociologists, historians, and other scholars, contributing to the rise of Madonna studies, a subfield of American cultural studies. According to Rodrigo Fres\u00e1n, \"saying that [0] is just a pop star is as inappropriate as saying that Coca-Cola is just a soda. [0] is one of the classic symbols of Made in USA.\" Rolling Stone Spain wrote, \"[0] became the first master of viral pop in history, years before the internet was massively used. [0] was everywhere; in the almighty music television channels, 'radio formulas', magazine covers and even in bookstores. A pop dialectic, never seen since the Beatles's's reign, which allowed [0] to keep on the edge of trend and commerciality.\" William Langley from The Daily Telegraph felt that \"[0] has changed the world's social history, has done more things as more different people than anyone else is ever likely to.\" Professor Diane Pecknold noted that \"nearly any poll of the biggest, greatest, or best in popular culture includes [[0]'s] name\". In 2012, VH1 ranked [0] as the greatest woman in music.Spin writer Bianca Gracie stated that \"the 'Queen of Pop' isn't enough to describe [0]\u2014[0] is Pop. [[0]] formulated the blueprint of what a pop star should be.\" According to Sclafani, \"It's worth noting that before [0], most music mega-stars were guy rockers; after [0], almost all would be female singers\u00a0... When the Beatles's hit USA, the Beatles's changed the paradigm of performer from solo act to band. [0] changed the paradigm of performer from solo act to band back\u2014with an emphasis on the female.\" Howard Kramer, curatorial director of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, asserted that \"[0] and the career [0] carved out for [0] made possible virtually every other female pop singer to follow\u00a0... [0] certainly raised the standards of virtually every other female pop singer\u00a0... [0] redefined what the parameters were for female performers.\" Andy Bennett and Steve Waksman, authors of The SAGE Handbook of Popular Music (2014), noted that \"almost all female pop stars of recent years\u2014Britney Spears, Beyonc\u00e9, Rihanna, Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, and others\u2014acknowledge the important influence of [0] on almost all female pop stars of recent years\u2014Britney Spears, Beyonc\u00e9, Rihanna, Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, and others\u2014's own careers.\" [0] has also influenced male artists, inspiring rock frontmen Liam Gallagher of Oasis and Chester Bennington of Linkin Park to become musicians.[0]'s use of sexual imagery has benefited her career and catalyzed public discourse on sexuality and feminism. The Times wrote that [0] had \"started a revolution amongst women in music\u00a0... [0]'s attitudes and opinions on sex, nudity, style, and sexuality forced the public to sit up and take notice.\" Professor John Fiske noted that the sense of empowerment that [0] offers is inextricably connected with the pleasure of exerting some control over the meanings of self, of sexuality, and of one's social relations. In Doing Gender in Media, Art and Culture (2009), the authors noted that [0], as a female celebrity, performer, and pop icon, can unsettle standing feminist reflections and debates. According to lesbian feminist Sheila Jeffreys, [0] represents woman's occupancy of what Monique Wittig calls the category of sex, as powerful, and appears to gleefully embrace the performance of the sexual corv\u00e9e allotted to women. Professor Sut Jhally has referred to [0] as \"an almost sacred feminist icon\".Writing for The Guardian, Matt Cain stated that [0] has \"broke down social barriers\" and brought marginalized groups to the forefront, by frequently featuring LGBT, Latino, and black culture in [0]'s works. An author said that \"by making culture generally available, [0] becomes the culture of all social classes\". Canadian professor Karlene Faith gave Canadian professor Karlene Faith's point of view saying that [0]'s peculiarity is that \"[0] has cruised so freely through so many cultural terrains\" and [0] \"has been a 'cult figure' within self-propelling subcultures just as [0] became a major.\" GLAAD president Sarah Kate Ellis stated that [0] \"always has and always will be the LGBTQ community's greatest ally\", while GLAAD president Sarah Kate Ellis dubbed [0] as \"the greatest gay icon\".[0] has received acclaim as a role model for businesswomen, \"achieving the kind of financial control that women had long fought for within the industry\", and generating over $1.2\u00a0billion in sales within the first decade of her career. According to Gini Gorlinski in the book The 100 Most Influential Musicians of All Time (2010), [0]'s levels of power and control were \"unprecedented\" for a woman in the industry. London Business School academics called [0] a \"dynamic entrepreneur\" worth copying; London Business School academics identified [0]'s vision of success, [0]'s understanding of the music industry, [0]'s ability to recognize [0]'s own performance limits (and thus bring in help), [0]'s willingness to work hard and [0]'s ability to adapt as the keys to [0]'s commercial success. Matt Cain wrote that \"[0] is opportunistic, manipulative, and ruthless\u2014somebody who won't stop until [0] gets what [0] wants\u2014and that's something you can get at the expense of maybe losing your close ones. But losing hardly mattered to [0].\""}, "Awards and achievements": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0]'s net worth is estimated between US$590\u00a0million to $800\u00a0million.
