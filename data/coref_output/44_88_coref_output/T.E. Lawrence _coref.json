[0] (16 August 1888\u00a0\u2013 19 May 1935) was a British archaeologist, army officer, diplomat, and writer who became renowned for [0]'s role in the Arab Revolt (1916\u20131918) and the Sinai and Palestine Campaign (1915\u20131918) against the Ottoman Empire during the First World War. The breadth and variety of his activities and associations, and [0]'s ability to describe his activities and associations vividly in writing, earned [0] international fame as Lawrence of Arabia, a title used for the 1962 film based on [0]'s wartime activities.[0] was born out of wedlock in 16 August 1888 to Sarah Junner (1861\u20131959), a governess, and Sir Thomas Chapman, 7th Baronet (1846\u20131919), an Anglo-Irish aristocrat. Sir Thomas Chapman, 7th Baronet (1846\u20131919), an Anglo-Irish aristocrat left Sir Thomas Chapman, 7th Baronet (1846\u20131919), an Anglo-Irish aristocrat's wife and family in Ireland to cohabit with Sarah Junner (1861\u20131959), a governess.

In 1896, the Lawrences moved to Oxford, where [0] attended the High School and then studied history at Jesus College, Oxford, from 1907 to 1910. Between 1910 and 1914 [0] worked as an archaeologist for the British Museum, chiefly at Carchemish in Ottoman Syria.Soon after the outbreak of war in 1914 [0] volunteered for the British Army and was stationed at the Arab Bureau (established in 1916) intelligence unit in Egypt. In 1916, [0] travelled to Mesopotamia and to Arabia on intelligence missions and became involved with the Arab Revolt as a liaison to the Arab forces, along with other British officers, supporting the Arab Kingdom of Hejaz's's independence war against the Arab Kingdom of Hejaz's's . [0] worked closely with Emir Faisal, a leader of the revolt, and [0] participated, sometimes as leader, in military actions against the Ottoman armed forces, culminating in the capture of Damascus in October 1918.After the First World War, [0] joined the British Foreign Office, working with the British government and with Emir Faisal, a leader of the revolt. In 1922, [0] retreated from public life and spent the years until 1935 serving as an enlisted man, mostly in the Royal Air Force (RAF), with a brief period in the British Army. During the years until 1935, [0] published [0]'s best-known work Seven Pillars of Wisdom (1926), an autobiographical account of [0]'s participation in the Arab Revolt. [0] also translated books into English, and wrote The Mint, which detailed [0]'s time in the Royal Air Force (RAF) working as an ordinary aircraftman. [0] corresponded extensively and was friendly with well-known artists, writers, and politicians. For the Royal Air Force (RAF), [0] participated in the development of rescue motorboats.[0]'s public image resulted in part from the sensationalised reporting of the Arab Revolt by American journalist Lowell Thomas, as well as from Seven Pillars of Wisdom. On 19 May 1935, six days after being injured in a motorcycle accident in Dorset, [0] died at the age of 46."}, "Early life": {"": "[0]  is our person to focus on. [0] was born on 16 August 1888 in Tremadog, Carnarvonshire, Wales, in a house named Gorphwysfa, now known as Snowdon Lodge. His Anglo-Irish father Thomas Chapman had left His Anglo-Irish father Thomas Chapman's wife Edith after His Anglo-Irish father Thomas Chapman had a first son with Sarah Junner, who had been governess to his daughters. Sarah Junner, who had been governess to his daughters had Sarah Junner, who had been governess to his daughters been an illegitimate child, born in Sunderland to Elizabeth Junner, a servant employed by a family named Lawrence; Elizabeth Junner, a servant employed by a family named Lawrence was dismissed four months before Sarah Junner, who had been governess to his daughters was born, and identified Sarah Junner, who had been governess to his daughters's father as \"John Junner, Shipwright journeyman\".Lawrence's parents did not marry but lived together under the pseudonym Lawrence. In 1914, His Anglo-Irish father Thomas Chapman inherited the Chapman baronetcy based at Killua Castle, the ancestral family home in County Westmeath, Ireland. Lawrence's parents had five sons, [0] [0]'s being the second eldest. From Wales, the family moved to Kirkcudbright, Galloway, in southwestern Scotland, then to Dinard in Brittany, then to Jersey.the family lived at Langley Lodge (now demolished) from 1894 to 1896, set in private woods between the eastern borders of the New Forest and Southampton Water in Hampshire. Langley Lodge (now demolished) was isolated, and [0] had many opportunities for outdoor activities and waterfront visits.In the summer of 1896, the family moved to 2 Polstead Road in Oxford, where the family lived until 1921. [0] attended the City of Oxford High School for Boys from 1896 until 1907, where one of the four houses was later named \"[0]\" in [0]'s honour; the City of Oxford High School for Boys closed in 1966. [0] and one of [0]'s brothers became commissioned officers in the Church Lads' Brigade at St Aldate's Church.[0] claimed that [0] ran away from home around 1905 and served for a few weeks as a boy soldier with the Royal Garrison Artillery at St Mawes Castle in Cornwall, from which [0] was bought out. However, no evidence of served appears in army records."}, "Travels, antiquities, and archaeology": {"": "[0]  is our person to focus on. At the age of 15, [0] cycled with his schoolfriend Cyril Beeson around Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, and Oxfordshire, visiting almost every village's's parish church, studying almost every village's's monuments and antiquities, and making rubbings of almost every village's's monumental brasses. Lawrence and Beeson his schoolfriend Cyril Beeson monitored building sites in Oxfordshire and presented the Ashmolean Museum with anything that Lawrence and Beeson found. the Ashmolean Museum's Annual Report for 1906 said that Lawrence and Beeson \"by incessant watchfulness secured everything of antiquarian value which has been found.\" In the summers of 1906 and 1907, [0] toured France by bicycle, sometimes with his schoolfriend Cyril Beeson, collecting photographs, drawings, and measurements of medieval castles. In August 1907, [0] wrote home: \"The Chaignons & the Lamballe people complimented [0] on [0]'s wonderful French: [0] have been asked twice since [0] arrived what part of France [0] came from\".From 1907 to 1910, [0] read history at Jesus College, Oxford. In July and August 1908 [0] cycled 2,200 miles (3,500\u00a0km) solo through France to the Mediterranean and back researching French castles. In the summer of 1909, [0] set out alone on a three-month walking tour of crusader castles in Ottoman Syria, during which [0] travelled 1,000 miles (1,600\u00a0km) on foot. While at Jesus College, Oxford [0] was a keen member of the University Officers' Training Corps (OTC). [0] graduated with First Class Honours after submitting a thesis titled The Influence of the Crusades on European Military Architecture\u2014to the End of the 12th Century, partly based on [0]'s field research with his schoolfriend Cyril Beeson in France, and [0]'s solo research in France and the Middle East. [0] was fascinated by the Middle Ages; [0]'s brother Arnold wrote in 1937 that \"medieval researches\" were a \"dream way of escape from bourgeois England\".In 1910, [0] was offered the opportunity to become a practising archaeologist at Carchemish, in the expedition that D. G. Hogarth was setting up on behalf of the British Museum. D. G. Hogarth arranged a \"Senior Demyship\" (a form of scholarship) for [0] at Magdalen College, Oxford, to fund [0]'s work at \u00a3100 a year. [0] sailed for Beirut in December 1910 and went to Byblos, where [0] studied Arabic. [0] then went to work on the excavations at Carchemish, near Jerablus in northern Syria, where [0] worked under D. G. Hogarth, R. Campbell Thompson of the British Museum, and Leonard Woolley until 1914. [0] later stated that everything which [0] had accomplished [0] owed to D. G. Hogarth. [0] met Gertrude Bell while excavating at Carchemish. [0] worked briefly with Flinders Petrie in 1912 at Kafr Ammar in Egypt.At Carchemish, [0] was involved in a high-tension relationship with a German-led team working nearby on the Baghdad Railway at Jerablus. While there was never open combat, there was regular conflict over access to land and treatment of the local workforce; [0] gained experience in Middle Eastern leadership practices and conflict resolution.In January 1914, Woolley and Lawrence were co-opted by the British military as an archaeological smokescreen for a British military survey of the Negev desert. Woolley and Lawrence were funded by the Palestine Exploration Fund to search for an area referred to in the Bible as the Wilderness of Zin, and Woolley and Lawrence made an archaeological survey of the Negev desert along the way. the Negev desert was strategically important, as an Ottoman army attacking Egypt would have to cross the Negev desert. Woolley and Lawrence subsequently published a report of Woolley and Lawrence's archaeological findings, but a more important result was Woolley and Lawrence's updated mapping of the Negev desert, with special attention to features of military relevance such as water sources. [0] also visited Aqaba and Shobek, not far from Petra."}, "Military intelligence": {"": "[0]  is our person to focus on. Following the outbreak of hostilities in August 1914, [0] did not immediately enlist in the British Army. [0] held back until October on the advice of S. F. Newcombe, when [0] was commissioned on the General List as temporary second lieutenant-interpreter. Before the end of 1914, [0] was summoned by renowned archaeologist and historian Lieutenant Commander David Hogarth, [0]'s mentor at Carchemish, to the new Arab Bureau intelligence unit in Cairo, and [0] arrived in Cairo on 15 December 1914. the new Arab Bureau intelligence unit in Cairo's chief was Brigadier-General Gilbert Clayton who reported to Egyptian High Commissioner Henry McMahon.The situation was complex during 1915. There was a growing Arab nationalist movement within the Arabic-speaking Ottoman territories, including many Arabs serving in the Ottoman armed forces. a growing Arab nationalist movement within the Arabic-speaking Ottoman territories, including many Arabs serving in the Ottoman armed forces were in contact with Sharif Hussein, Emir of Mecca, who was negotiating with the British and offering to lead an Arab uprising against the Ottomans. In exchange, Sharif Hussein, Emir of Mecca, who was negotiating with the British and offering to lead an Arab uprising against the Ottomans wanted a British guarantee of an independent Arab state including the Hejaz, Syria, and Mesopotamia. Such an uprising would have been helpful to Britain in Britain's war against the Ottomans, lessening the threat against the Suez Canal. However, there was resistance from French diplomats who insisted that Syria's future was as a French colony, not an independent Arab state. There were also strong objections from the Government of India, which was nominally part of the British government but acted independently. the Government of India, which was nominally part of the British government but acted independently's vision was of Mesopotamia under British control serving as a granary for India, which was nominally part of the British government but acted independently; furthermore, the Government of India, which was nominally part of the British government but acted independently wanted to hold on to the Government of India, which was nominally part of the British government but acted independently's Arabian outpost in Aden.At the new Arab Bureau intelligence unit in Cairo, [0] supervised the preparation of maps, produced a daily bulletin for the British generals operating in the theatre, and interviewed prisoners. [0] was an advocate of a British landing at Alexandretta which never came to pass. [0] was also a consistent advocate of an independent Arab Syria.The situation came to a crisis in October, as Sharif Hussein, Emir of Mecca, who was negotiating with the British and offering to lead an Arab uprising against the Ottomans demanded an immediate commitment from Britain, with the threat that he would otherwise throw his weight behind the OttomansSharif Hussein, Emir of Mecca, who was negotiating with the British and offering to lead an Arab uprising against the Ottomans Sharif Hussein, Emir of Mecca, who was negotiating with the British and offering to lead an Arab uprising against the Ottomans's . the threat that he would otherwise throw his weight behind the Ottomans would create a credible Pan-Islamic message that could have been dangerous for Britain. The British replied with a letter from Egyptian High Commissioner Henry McMahon that was generally agreeable while reserving commitments concerning the Mediterranean coastline and Holy Land.In the spring of 1916, [0] was dispatched to Mesopotamia to assist in relieving the Siege of Kut by some combination of starting an Arab uprising and bribing Ottoman officials. This mission produced no useful result. Meanwhile, the Sykes\u2013Picot Agreement was being negotiated in London, without the knowledge of British officials in Cairo, which awarded a large proportion of Syria to India, which was nominally part of the British government but acted independently. Further, the Sykes\u2013Picot Agreement implied that the Arabs would have to conquer Syria's four great cities if the Arabs were to have any sort of state there: Syria's four great cities. It is unclear at what point [0] became aware of the Sykes\u2013Picot Agreement's contents."}, "Arab Revolt": {"": "T.E. Lawrence  is our person to focus on. [0] began in June 1916, but [0] bogged down after a few successes, with a real risk that the Ottoman forces would advance along the coast of the Red Sea and recapture Mecca. On 16 October 1916, T.E. Lawrence was sent to the Hejaz on an intelligence-gathering mission led by Ronald Storrs. T.E. Lawrence interviewed Sharif Hussein's sons Ali, Abdullah, and Faisal, and concluded that Faisal was the best candidate to lead [0].In November, S. F. Newcombe was assigned to lead a permanent British liaison to Faisal's staff. S. F. Newcombe had not yet arrived in the area and the matter was of some urgency, so T.E. Lawrence was sent in S. F. Newcombe's place. In late December 1916, Faisal and T.E. Lawrence worked out a plan for repositioning the Arab forces to put the railway from Syria under threat while preventing the Ottoman forces from threatening Arab positions. S. F. Newcombe arrived while T.E. Lawrence was preparing to leave Arabia, but Faisal intervened urgently, asking that T.E. Lawrence's assignment become permanent.T.E. Lawrence's most important contributions to [0] were in the area of strategy and liaison with British Armed Forces, but T.E. Lawrence also participated personally in several military engagements:T.E. Lawrence made a 300-mile (480\u00a0km) personal journey northward in June 1917, on the way to Aqaba, visiting Ras Baalbek, the outskirts of Damascus, and Azraq, Jordan. T.E. Lawrence met Arab nationalists, counselling Arab nationalists to avoid revolt until the arrival of Faisal's forces, and T.E. Lawrence attacked a bridge to create the impression of guerrilla activity. T.E. Lawrence's findings were regarded by the British as extremely valuable and there was serious consideration of awarding T.E. Lawrence a Victoria Cross; in the end, T.E. Lawrence was invested as a Companion of the Order of the Bath and promoted to major.T.E. Lawrence travelled regularly between British headquarters and Faisal, co-ordinating military action. But by early 1918, Faisal's chief British liaison was Lieutenant Colonel Pierce Charles Joyce, and T.E. Lawrence's time was chiefly devoted to raiding and intelligence-gathering.", "Strategy": "[0]  is our person to focus on. The chief elements of the Arab strategy which Faisal and [0] developed were to avoid capturing Medina, and to extend northward through Maan and Dera'a to Damascus and beyond. Faisal wanted to lead regular attacks against the Ottomans, but [0] persuaded Faisal to drop lead. [0] wrote about the Bedouin as a fighting force:The value of the tribes is defensive only and the tribes's real sphere is guerilla warfare. the tribes are intelligent, and very lively, almost reckless, but too individualistic to endure commands, or fight in line, or to help each other. It would, [0] think, be possible to make an organized force out of the tribes.\u2026 The Hejaz war is one of dervishes against regular forces\u2014and we are on the side of dervishes. Our text-books do not apply to The Hejaz war's conditions at all. Medina was an attractive target for the revolt as Islam's second-holiest site, and because Medina's Ottoman garrison was weakened by disease and isolation. It became clear that it was advantageous to leave Medina there rather than try to capture Medina, while attacking the Hejaz railway south from Damascus without permanently destroying the Hejaz railway south from Damascus. attacking prevented the Ottomans from making effective use of the Ottomans's troops at Medina, and forced the Ottomans to dedicate many resources to defending and repairing the Hejaz railway south from Damascus. However, Aldington strongly disagrees with the value of the strategy.It is not known when [0] learned the details of the Sykes\u2013Picot Agreement, nor if or when [0] briefed Faisal on what [0] knew, however, there is good reason to think that both these things happened, and earlier rather than later. In particular, the strategy makes perfect sense given the Sykes-Picot language that spoke of an independent Arab entity in Syria, which would be granted only if the Arabs liberated the territory the Arabs. The French and some of The French's British Liaison officers were specifically uncomfortable about the northward movement, as the northward movement would weaken French colonial claims.", "Capture of Aqaba": "[0]  is our person to focus on. In 1917, [0] proposed a joint action with the Arab irregulars and forces including Auda Abu Tayi, who had previously been in the employ of the Ottomans, against the strategically located but lightly defended town of Aqaba on the Red Sea. the strategically located but lightly defended town of Aqaba on the Red Sea could have been attacked from the Red Sea, but the narrow defiles leading through the mountains were strongly defended and would have been very difficult to assault. The expedition was led by Sharif Nasir of Medina.[0] avoided informing [0]'s British superiors about the details of The expedition, due to concern that The expedition would be blocked as contrary to French interests. The expedition departed from Wejh on 9 May, and the strategically located but lightly defended town of Aqaba on the Red Sea fell to the Arab forces on 6 July, after a surprise overland attack which took the Turkish defences from behind. After the strategically located but lightly defended town of Aqaba on the Red Sea, General Sir Edmund Allenby, the new commander-in-chief of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force, agreed to [0]'s strategy for the revolt. [0] now held a powerful position as an adviser to Faisal and a person who had General Sir Edmund Allenby, the new commander-in-chief of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force's confidence, as General Sir Edmund Allenby, the new commander-in-chief of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force acknowledged after the war:General Sir Edmund Allenby, the new commander-in-chief of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force gave [0] a free hand. [0]'s cooperation was marked by the utmost loyalty, and General Sir Edmund Allenby, the new commander-in-chief of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force never had anything but praise for [0]'s work, which, indeed, was invaluable throughout the campaign. [0] was the mainspring of the Arab movement and knew the Arab movement's language, the Arab movement's manners and the Arab movement's mentality. ", "Dera'a": "[0]  is our person to focus on. [0] describes an episode on 20 November 1917 while reconnoitring Dera'a in disguise, when [0] was captured by the Ottoman military, beaten, and sexually assaulted by the local bey and the local bey's guardsmen, though [0] does not specify the nature of the sexual contact. Some scholars have stated that [0] exaggerated the severity of the injuries that [0] suffered, or alleged that an episode on 20 November 1917 never happened. There is no independent testimony, but the multiple consistent reports and the absence of evidence for outright invention in [0]'s works make the account believable to some of [0]'s biographers. Malcolm Brown, John E. Mack, and Jeremy Wilson have argued that an episode on 20 November 1917 had strong psychological effects on [0], which may explain some of [0]'s unconventional behaviour in later life. [0] ended the account an episode on 20 November 1917 in Seven Pillars of Wisdom with the statement: \"In Dera'a that night the citadel of [0]'s integrity had been irrevocably lost.\"The son of the Governor resident in Dera'a at the time has been quoted as saying the account must be false, because [0] describes the local bey's hair, while in fact the local bey was bald. In fact, [0] describes (in the 1922 text) the local bey's head as shaven, with stubble standing up. There is also uncertainty about the identity of the local bey.", "Fall of Damascus": "[0]  is our person to focus on. [0] was involved in the build-up to the capture of Damascus in the final weeks of the war, but [0] was not present at Damascus's formal surrender. [0] arrived several hours after Damascus had the capture of Damascus, entering Damascus around 9\u00a0am on 1 October 1918; the first to arrive was the 10th Light Horse Regiment led by Major A. C. N. \"Harry\" Olden, who accepted the formal surrender of Damascus from acting Governor Emir Said. [0] was instrumental in establishing a provisional Arab government under Faisal in Damascus[0] . Faisal's rule as king, however, came to an abrupt end in 1920, after the battle of Maysaloun when the French Forces of General Henri Gouraud entered Damascus under the command of General Mariano Goybet, destroying [0]'s dream of an independent Arabia.During the closing years of the war, [0] sought to convince his superiors in the British government that Arab independence was in his superiors in the British government's interests, but [0] met with mixed success. The secret Sykes-Picot Agreement between France and Britain contradicted the promises of independence that [0] had made to the Arabs and frustrated [0]'s work."}, "Post-war years": {"": "[0]  is our person to focus on. [0] returned to the United Kingdom a full colonel. Immediately after the war, [0] worked for the Foreign Office, attending the Paris Peace Conference between January and May as a member of Faisal's delegation. On 17 May 1919, a Handley Page Type O/400 taking [0] to Egypt crashed at the airport of Roma-Centocelle. The pilot and co-pilot were killed; [0] survived with a broken shoulder blade and two broken ribs. During [0]'s brief hospitalisation, [0] was visited by King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy.In 1918, Lowell Thomas went to Jerusalem where Lowell Thomas met [0]Lowell Thomas's . Lowell Thomas and Lowell Thomas's cameraman Harry Chase shot a great deal of film and many photographs involving [0]. Lowell Thomas produced a stage presentation entitled With Allenby in Palestine which included a lecture, dancing, and music and depicted the Middle East as exotic, mysterious, sensuous, and violent.The show premiered in New York in March 1919. Lowell Thomas was invited to take The show to England, and Lowell Thomas agreed to do so provided that Lowell Thomas was personally invited by the King and provided the use of either Drury Lane or Covent Garden. Lowell Thomas opened at Covent Garden on 14 August 1919 and continued for hundreds of lectures, \"attended by the highest in the land\".Initially, [0] played only a supporting role in The show, as the main focus was on Lowell Thomas's campaigns; but then Lowell Thomas realised that it was the photos of [0] dressed as a Bedouin which had captured the public's imagination, so Lowell Thomas had [0] photographed again in London in Arab dress. With the new photos, Lowell Thomas re-launched The show under the new title With Allenby in Palestine and Lawrence in Arabia in early 1920, which proved to be extremely popular. the new title With Allenby in Palestine and Lawrence in Arabia elevated [0] from a supporting role to a co-star of the Near Eastern campaign and reflected a changed emphasis. Lowell Thomas's shows made [0] into a household name. [0] worked with Lowell Thomas on the creation of The show, answering many questions and posing for many photographs. After The show's success, however, [0] expressed regret about having been featured in The show.[0] served as an advisor to Winston Churchill at the Foreign Office for just over a year starting in February 1920. [0] hated bureaucratic work, writing on 21 May 1921 to Robert Graves: \"[0] wish [0] hadn't gone out there: the Arabs are like a page [0] have turned over; and sequels are rotten things. [0]'m locked up here: office every day and much of it\". [0] travelled to the Middle East on multiple occasions during this period, at one time holding the title of \"chief political officer for Trans-Jordania\". [0] campaigned for [0]'s and Winston Churchill's vision of the Middle East, publishing pieces in multiple newspapers, including The Times, The Observer, The Daily Mail, and The Daily Express.[0] had a sinister reputation in France during [0]'s lifetime and even today as an implacable \"enemy of France\", the man who was constantly stirring up the Syrians to rebel against French rule throughout the 1920s. However, French historian Maurice Lar\u00e8s wrote that the real reason for France's problems in Syria was that the Syrians did not want to be ruled by France, and the French needed a scapegoat to blame for the French's difficulties in ruling Syria. French historian Maurice Lar\u00e8s wrote that [0] is usually pictured in France as a Francophobe, but [0] was really a Francophile.Having seen and admired the effective use of air power during the war, [0] enlisted in the Royal Air Force as an aircraftman, under the name John Hume Ross in August 1922. At the the Royal Air Force recruiting centre in Covent Garden, London, [0] was interviewed by recruiting officer Flying Officer W. E. Johns, later known as the author of the Biggles series of novels. recruiting officer Flying Officer W. E. Johns, later known as the author of the Biggles series of novels rejected [0]'s application, as recruiting officer Flying Officer W. E. Johns, later known as the author of the Biggles series of novels suspected that the name John Hume Ross was a false name. [0] admitted that was was so and that [0] had provided false documents. [0] left, but returned some time later with an the Royal Air Force messenger who carried a written order that recruiting officer Flying Officer W. E. Johns, later known as the author of the Biggles series of novels must accept [0].However, [0] was forced out of the Royal Air Force in February 1923 after [0]'s identity was exposed. [0] changed [0]'s name to T. E. Shaw (apparently as a consequence of [0]'s friendship with G. B. and Charlotte Shaw) and joined the Royal Tank Corps later that year. [0] was unhappy there and repeatedly petitioned to rejoin the Royal Air Force. A fresh burst of publicity after the publication of Revolt in the Desert resulted in [0]'s assignment to bases at Karachi and Miramshah in British India (now Pakistan) in late 1926, where [0] remained until the end of 1928. At the end of 1928, [0] was forced to return to Britain after rumours began to circulate that [0] was involved in espionage activities.[0] purchased several small plots of land in Chingford, built a hut and swimming pool there, and visited frequently. a hut was removed in 1930 when Chingford Urban District Council acquired several small plots of land in Chingford; a hut was given to the City of London Corporation which re-erected a hut in the grounds of The Warren, Loughton. [0]'s tenure of several small plots of land in Chingford has now been commemorated by a plaque fixed on the sighting obelisk on Pole Hill.[0] continued serving at several the Royal Air Force bases, notably at RAF Mount Batten near Plymouth, RAF Calshot near Southampton, and RAF Bridlington, East Riding of Yorkshire. In the inter-war period, the Royal Air Force's Marine Craft Section began to commission air-sea rescue launches capable of higher speeds and greater capacity. The arrival of high-speed craft into the MCS was driven in part by [0]. [0] had previously witnessed a seaplane crew drowning when the seaplane tender sent to a seaplane crew's rescue was too slow in arriving. [0] worked with Hubert Scott-Paine, the founder of the British Power Boat Company (BPBC), to introduce the 37.5-foot (11.4\u00a0m) long ST 200 Seaplane Tender Mk1 into service. These boats had a range of 140 miles (230\u00a0km) when cruising at 24 knots and could achieve a top speed of 29 knots.[0] professed happiness, and [0] left the Royal Air Force with considerable regret at the end of [0]'s enlistment in March 1935. There is some evidence that at that time the British government was interested in bringing [0] into some role in the national defense organization, in the context of the rising threat of Nazi Germany."}, "Death": {"": "[0]  is our person to focus on. [0] was a keen motorcyclist and owned eight Brough Superior motorcycles at different times. [0]'s last SS100 (Registration GW 2275) is privately owned but has been on loan to the National Motor Museum, Beaulieu and the Imperial War Museum in London.  In 1934, [0] motorcycled over 200 miles from Manchester to Winchester to meet Eug\u00e8ne Vinaver, editor of the Winchester Manuscript of Thomas Malory's's Le Morte d'Arthur, a book which [0] admired and carried on Thomas Malory's's campaigns.On 13 May 1935, [0] was fatally injured in an accident on his Brough Superior SS100 motorcycle in Dorset close to his cottage Clouds Hill, near Wareham, just two months after leaving military service. A dip in the road obstructed [0]'s view of two boys on their bicyclestwo boys on their bicycles's ; [0] swerved to avoid two boys on their bicycles, lost control, and was thrown over the handlebars. [0] died six days later on 19 May 1935, aged 46. The location of an accident on his Brough Superior SS100 motorcycle in Dorset close to his cottage Clouds Hill, near Wareham, just two months after leaving military service is marked by a small memorial at the roadside. One of the doctors attending [0] was neurosurgeon Hugh Cairns, who consequently began a long study of the loss of life by motorcycle dispatch riders through head injuries. neurosurgeon Hugh Cairns, who consequently began a long study of the loss of life by motorcycle dispatch riders through head injuries's research led to the use of crash helmets by both military and civilian motorcyclists.The Moreton estate borders Bovington Camp, and [0] bought his cottage Clouds Hill, near Wareham from his cousins, the Frampton family. [0] had been a frequent visitor to his cousins, the Frampton family's home, Okers Wood House, and had corresponded with Louisa Frampton for years. [0]'s mother arranged with his cousins, the Frampton family to have [0]'s body buried in his cousins, the Frampton family's family plot in the separate burial ground of St Nicholas' Church, Moreton. The coffin was transported on The Moreton estate's bier. Mourners included Winston Churchill, E. M. Forster, Lady Astor, and [0]'s youngest brother Arnold. Winston Churchill described [0] like this: \"[0] was one of those beings whose pace of life was faster and more intense than what is normal.\"The inquest into Lawrence's death was conducted hurriedly and there was conflicting testimony, particularly in the report of a \"black car\" which may or may not have been present at the scene of an accident on his Brough Superior SS100 motorcycle in Dorset close to his cottage Clouds Hill, near Wareham, just two months after leaving military service, and the behaviour of the bicycling boys. Some have speculated that [0] was assassinated yet it is generally accepted that Lawrence's death was an accident due to a lack of evidence supporting this narrative."}, "Writings": {"": "[0]  is our person to focus on. [0] was a prolific writer throughout [0]'s life, a large portion of which was epistolary; [0] often sent several letters a day, and several collections of [0]'s letters have been published. [0] corresponded with many notable figures, including George Bernard Shaw, Edward Elgar, Winston Churchill, Robert Graves, No\u00ebl Coward, E. M. Forster, Siegfried Sassoon, John Buchan, Augustus John, and Henry Williamson. [0] met Joseph Conrad and commented perceptively on Joseph Conrad's works. [0] sent many letters to George Bernard Shaw's wife, Charlotte.[0] was a competent speaker of French and Arabic, and reader of Latin and Ancient Greek. [0] published three major texts in [0]'s lifetime. The most significant was [0]'s account of the Arab Revolt in Seven Pillars of Wisdom. Homer's Odyssey and The Forest Giant were translations, The Forest Giant an otherwise forgotten work of French fiction. [0] received a flat fee for the second translation, and negotiated a generous fee plus royalties for the first.", "Seven Pillars of Wisdom": "[0]  is our person to focus on. [0]'s major work is Seven Pillars of Wisdom, an account of his war experiences. In 1919, [0] was elected to a seven-year research fellowship at All Souls College, Oxford, providing [0] with support while [0] worked on Seven Pillars of Wisdom, an account of his war experiences. Certain parts of Seven Pillars of Wisdom, an account of his war experiences also serve as essays on military strategy, Arabian culture and geography, and other topics. [0] rewrote Seven Pillars of Wisdom, an account of his war experiences three times, once \"blind\" after [0] lost the manuscript.There are many alleged \"embellishments\" in Seven Pillars of Wisdom, an account of his war experiences, though some allegations have been disproved with time, most definitively in Jeremy Wilson's authorised biography. However, [0]'s own notebooks refute [0]'s claim to have crossed the Sinai Peninsula from Aqaba to the Suez Canal in just 49 hours without any sleep. In reality, crossed lasted for more than 70 hours and was interrupted by two long breaks for sleeping, which [0] omitted when [0] wrote Seven Pillars of Wisdom, an account of his war experiences.In the preface, [0] acknowledged George Bernard Shaw's help in editing Seven Pillars of Wisdom, an account of his war experiences. The first edition was published in 1926 as a high-priced private subscription edition, printed in London by Herbert John Hodgson and Roy Manning Pike, with illustrations by Eric Kennington, Augustus John, Paul Nash, Blair Hughes-Stanton, and Blair Hughes-Stanton's wife Gertrude Hermes. [0] was afraid that the public would think that [0] would make a substantial income from Seven Pillars of Wisdom, an account of his war experiences, and [0] stated that Seven Pillars of Wisdom, an account of his war experiences was written as a result of [0]'s war service. [0] vowed not to take any money from Seven Pillars of Wisdom, an account of his war experiences, and indeed [0] did not, as the sale price was one third of the production costs, leaving [0] in substantial debt. [0] always took care not to give the impression that [0] had profited economically from the Arab revolt. In a 'deleted chapter' of Seven Pillars of Wisdom, an account of his war experiences which reappeared in 2022, [0] wrote:  For [0]'s work on the Arab front [0] had determined to accept nothing. The cabinet raised the Arabs to fight for us by definite promises of self-government afterwards. Arabs believe in persons, not in institutions. Arabs saw in [0] a free agent of the British government, and demanded from [0] an endorsement of the British government's written promises. So [0] had to join the conspiracy, and, for what [0]'s word was worth, assured the men of the men's reward. In our's two years' partnership under fire the men grew accustomed to believing [0] and to think [0]'s government, like [0], sincere. In this hope the men performed some fine things but, of course, instead of being proud of what our did together, [0] was continually and bitterly ashamed. As a specialist in the Middle East, Fred Halliday praised Seven Pillars of Wisdom, an account of his war experiences as a \"fine work of prose\" but described Seven Pillars of Wisdom, an account of his war experiences's relevance to the study of Arab history and society as \"almost worthless.\"", "Revolt in the Desert": "[0]  is our person to focus on. Revolt in the Desert was an abridged version of Seven Pillars that [0] began in 1926 and that was published in March 1927 in both limited and trade editions. [0] undertook a needed but reluctant publicity exercise, which resulted in a best-seller. Again [0] vowed not to take any fees from Revolt in the Desert, partly to appease the subscribers to Seven Pillars who had paid dearly for their editionsthe subscribers to Seven Pillars who had paid dearly for their editions's . By the fourth reprint in March 1927, the debt from Seven Pillars was paid off. As [0] left for military service in India at the end of 1926, [0] set up the \"Seven Pillars Trust\" with his friend D. G. Hogarth as a trustee, in which [0] made over the copyright and any surplus income of Revolt in the Desert. [0] later told his friend D. G. Hogarth that [0] had \"made the \"Seven Pillars Trust\" final, to save [0] the temptation of reviewing the \"Seven Pillars Trust\", if Revolt in the Desert turned out a best seller.\"The resultant trust paid off the debt from Seven Pillars, and [0] then invoked a clause in [0]'s publishing contract to halt publication of Revolt in the Desert in the United Kingdom. However, [0] allowed both American editions and translations, which resulted in a substantial flow of income. the \"Seven Pillars Trust\" paid income either into an educational fund for children of the United Kingdom who lost RAF officers's lives or were invalided as a result of service, or more substantially into the the United Kingdom Benevolent Fund.", "Posthumous": "[0]  is our person to focus on. [0] left The Mint unpublished, a memoir of his experiences as an enlisted man in the Royal Air Force (RAF). For a memoir of his experiences as an enlisted man in the Royal Air Force (RAF), [0] worked from a notebook that [0] kept while enlisted, writing of the daily lives of enlisted men and [0]'s desire to be a part of something larger than [0]. a memoir of his experiences as an enlisted man in the Royal Air Force (RAF) is stylistically different from Seven Pillars of Wisdom, using sparse prose as opposed to the complicated syntax found in Seven Pillars of Wisdom. a memoir of his experiences as an enlisted man in the Royal Air Force (RAF) was published posthumously, edited by his brother Arnold.After Lawrence's death, his brother Arnold inherited Lawrence's estate and [0]'s copyrights as the sole beneficiary. To pay the inheritance tax, his brother Arnold sold the US copyright of Seven Pillars of Wisdom (subscribers' text) outright to Doubleday Doran in 1935. Doubleday Doran controlled publication rights of this version of the text of Seven Pillars of Wisdom in the US until the US copyright of Seven Pillars of Wisdom (subscribers' text) expired at the end of 2022 (publication plus 95 years). In 1936, his brother Arnold his brother Arnold split the remaining assets of Lawrence's estate, giving Clouds Hill and many copies of less substantial or historical letters to the National Trust, and then set up two trusts to control interests in his brother's residual copyrights. his brother Arnold assigned the US copyright of Seven Pillars of Wisdom (subscribers' text) to the Seven Pillars of Wisdom Trust, and the US copyright of Seven Pillars of Wisdom (subscribers' text) was given the US copyright of Seven Pillars of Wisdom (subscribers' text)'s first general publication as a result. his brother Arnold assigned the copyright in The Mint and all Lawrence's letters to the Letters and Symposium Trust, which his brother Arnold edited and published in the book T. E. Lawrence by [0]'s Friends in 1937.A substantial amount of income went directly to the RAF Benevolent Fund and to archaeological, environmental, and academic projects. two trusts to control interests in his brother's residual copyrights were amalgamated in 1986, and the unified trust acquired all the remaining rights to [0]'s works that the unified trust had not owned on Lawrence's death in 1991, plus rights to all of [0]'s works. The UK copyrights on [0]'s works published in [0]'s lifetime and within 20 years of his death expired on 1 January 2006. Works published more than 20 years after his death were protected for 50 years from publication or to 1 January 2040, whichever is earlier."}, "Published works": {"": ""}, "Sexuality": {"": "[0]  is our person to focus on. [0]'s biographers have discussed [0]'s sexuality at considerable length and discussed has spilled into the popular press. There is no direct evidence for consensual sexual intimacy between [0] and any person. [0]'s friends have expressed the opinion that [0] was asexual, and [0] specifically denied any personal experience of sex in multiple private letters. There were suggestions that [0] had been intimate with [0]'s companion Selim Ahmed, \"Dahoum\", who worked with [0] at a pre-war archaeological dig in Carchemish, and fellow serviceman R. A. M. Guy, but [0]'s biographers and contemporaries found them unconvincing.The dedication to his book Seven Pillars is a poem titled \"To S.A.\" which opens:I loved S.A., so I drew these tides of men into I's handsand wrote I's will across the sky in starsTo earn S.A. Freedom, the seven-pillared worthy house,that S.A.'s eyes might be shining for meWhen we came.[0] was never specific about the identity of \"S.A.\" Many theories argue in favour of individual men or women, and the Arab nation as a whole. The most popular theory is that S.A. represents (at least in part) Dahoum, who apparently died of typhus before [0] lived in a period of strong official opposition to homosexuality, but [0]'s writing on homosexuality was tolerant. [0] wrote to Charlotte Shaw, \"[0]'ve seen lots of man-and-man loves: very lovely and fortunate some of man-and-man loves were.\" [0] refers to \"the openness and honesty of perfect love\" on one occasion in his book Seven Pillars, when discussing relationships between young male fighters in the war. The passage in the front matter is referred to with the single-word tag \"Sex\".[0] wrote in Chapter\u00a01 of his book Seven Pillars:In horror of such sordid commerce [diseased female prostitutes] our youths began indifferently to slake one another's few needs in our youths's own clean bodies \u2014 a cold convenience that, by comparison, seemed sexless and even pure. Later, some began to justify this sterile process, and swore that friends quivering together in the yielding sand with intimate hot limbs in supreme embrace, found there hidden in the darkness a sensual co-efficient of the mental passion which was welding our souls and spirits in one flaming effort [to secure Arab independence]. Several, thirsting to punish appetites Several could not wholly prevent, took a savage pride in degrading the body, and offered Several fiercely in any habit which promised physical pain or filth. There is considerable evidence that [0] was a masochist. [0] wrote in [0]'s description of the Dera'a beating that \"a delicious warmth, probably sexual, was swelling through [0],\" and [0] also included a detailed description of the guards' whip in a style typical of masochists' writing. In later life, [0] arranged to pay a military colleague to administer beatings to [0], and to be subjected to severe formal tests of fitness and stamina. John Bruce first wrote on this topic, including some other statements that were not credible, but [0]'s biographers regard the beatings as established fact. French novelist Andr\u00e9 Malraux admired [0] but wrote that [0] had a \"taste for self-humiliation, now by discipline and now by veneration; a horror of respectability; a disgust for possessions\". Biographer Lawrence James wrote that the evidence suggested a \"strong homosexual masochism\", noting that [0] never sought punishment from women.Psychologist John E. Mack sees a possible connection between [0]'s masochism and the childhood beatings that he had received from his mother for routine misbehaviours. His brother Arnold thought that the childhood beatings that he had received from his mother for routine misbehaviours had been given for the purpose of breaking His brother Arnold's will. Angus Calder suggested in 1997 that [0]'s apparent masochism and self-loathing might have stemmed from a sense of guilt over losing [0]'s brothers Frank and Will on the Western Front, along with many other school friends, while [0] survived."}, "Aldington controversy": {"": "[0]  is our person to focus on. In 1955 Richard Aldington published Lawrence of Arabia: A Biographical Enquiry, a sustained attack on [0]'s character, writing, accomplishments, and truthfulness. Specifically, Richard Aldington alleged that [0] lied and exaggerated continuously, promoted a misguided policy in the Middle East, that [0]'s strategy of containing but not capturing Medina was incorrect, and that Seven Pillars of Wisdom was a bad book with few redeeming features. Richard Aldington also revealed [0]'s illegitimacy and strongly suggested that [0] was homosexual. For example: \"Seven Pillars of Wisdom is rather a work of quasi-fiction than history\", and \"It was seldom that [0] reported any fact or episode involving himself without embellishing any fact or episode involving himself and indeed in some cases entirely inventing any fact or episode involving himself.\"It is significant that Richard Aldington was a colonialist, arguing that the French colonial administration of Syria (resisted by [0]) had benefited Syria and that Arabia's peoples were \"far enough advanced for some government though not for complete self-government.\" Richard Aldington was also a Francophile, railing against [0]'s \"Francophobia, a hatred and an envy so irrational, so irresponsible and so unscrupulous that it is fair to say [0]'s attitude towards Syria was determined more by hatred of France than by devotion to the 'Arabs' \u2013 a convenient propaganda word which grouped many disharmonious and even mutually hostile tribes and peoples.\"Prior to the publication of Aldington's book, Aldington's book's contents became known in London's literary community. A group Richard Aldington and some subsequent authors referred to as \"The Lawrence Bureau\", led by B. H. Liddell Hart, tried energetically, starting in 1954, to have Aldington's book suppressed. When tried failed, B. H. Liddell Hart prepared and distributed hundreds of copies of Aldington's book: Richard Aldington's Charges \u2013 and Treatment of the Evidence, a 7-page single-spaced document. distributed worked: Aldington's book received many extremely negative and even abusive reviews, with strong evidence that some reviewers had read B. H. Liddell Hart's rebuttal but not Aldington's book.Richard Aldington wrote that [0] embellished many stories and invented others, and in particular that [0]'s claims involving numbers were usually inflated \u2013 for example claims of having read 50,000\u00a0books in the Oxford Union library, of having blown up 79\u00a0bridges, of having had a price of \u00a350,000 on [0]'s head, and of having suffered 60\u00a0or more injuries. Many of Richard Aldington's specific claims against [0] have been accepted by subsequent biographers. In Richard Aldington and Lawrence of Arabia: A Cautionary Tale, Fred D. Crawford writes \"Much that shocked in 1955 is now standard knowledge \u2013 that [0] was illegitimate, that was profoundly troubled [0], that [0] frequently resented [0]'s mother's dominance, that such reminiscences as [0] by [0]'s Friends are not reliable, that [0]'s leg-pulling and other adolescent traits could be offensive, that [0] took liberties with the truth in [0]'s official reports and Seven Pillars, that the significance of [0]'s exploits during the Arab Revolt was more political than military, that [0] contributed to [0]'s own myth, that when [0] vetted the books by Graves and Liddell Hart [0] let remain much that [0] knew was untrue, and that [0]'s feelings about publicity were ambiguous.\"This has not prevented most post-Richard Aldington biographers (including Fred D. Crawford) from expressing strong admiration for [0]'s military, political, and writing achievements."}, "Awards and commemorations": {"": "[0]  is our person to focus on.
