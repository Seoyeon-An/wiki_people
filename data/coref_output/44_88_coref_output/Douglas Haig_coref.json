{"summary": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. Field Marshal Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig, KT, GCB, OM, GCVO, KCIE (/he\u026a\u0261/; 19 June 1861 \u2013 29 January 1928) was a senior officer of the British Army. During the First World War [0] commanded the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the Western Front from late 1915 until the end of the First World War. [0] was commander during the Battle of the Somme, the Battle of Arras, the Third Battle of Ypres, the German Spring Offensive, and the Hundred Days Offensive.[0]'s military career included service in the War Office, where [0] was instrumental in the creation of the Territorial Force in 1908. In January 1917 [0] was promoted to the rank of Field Marshal, subsequently leading the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) during the Hundred Days Offensivethe British Expeditionary Force (BEF) . the Hundred Days Offensive, in combination with the Kiel mutiny, the Wilhelmshaven mutiny, the proclamation of a republic on 9 November 1918 and civil unrest across Germany, led to the armistice of 11 November 1918. the Hundred Days Offensive is considered by some historians to be one of the greatest victories ever achieved by a British-led army.[0] gained a favourable reputation during the immediate post-war years, with [0]'s funeral becoming a day of national mourning. However [0] also had some prominent contemporary detractors and, beginning in the 1960s, has been widely criticised for [0]'s leadership during the First World War. [0] was nicknamed \"Butcher Haig\" for the two million British casualties endured under his command. The Canadian War Museum comments: \"[0]'s epic but costly offensives at the Somme (1916) and Passchendaele (1917) have become nearly synonymous with the carnage and futility of First World War battles.\"Major-General John Davidson, one of [0]'s biographers, praised [0]'s leadership, and since the 1980s many historians have argued that the public hatred with which [0]'s name had come to be associated failed to recognise the adoption of new tactics and technologies by forces under his command, the important role played by British forces in the allied victory of 1918, and that high casualties were a consequence of the tactical and strategic realities of the time."}, "Early life": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was born in a house on Charlotte Square, Edinburgh (but with postal address 19 Hope Street, the side street to the south-west; a plaque exists). His father, John Richard Haig, an alcoholic, was said to be \"in trade\", though as head of the family's successful Haig & Haig whisky distillery, His father, John Richard Haig, an alcoholic, had an income of \u00a310,000 per year (\u00a31,160,000 in 2018), an enormous amount at the time. His mother, Rachel (daughter of Hugh Veitch of Stewartfield), was from a gentry family fallen into straitened circumstances. His mother, Rachel (daughter of Hugh Veitch of Stewartfield),'s cousin, Violet Veitch, was mother of the playwright, composer and performer No\u00ebl Coward. The family home was Haig House in Windygates, Fife.[0]'s education began in 1869 as a boarder at Mr Bateson's School in Clifton Bank, St Andrews. Later in 1869, [0] switched to Edinburgh Collegiate School, and then in 1871 to Orwell House, a preparatory school in Warwickshire. [0] then attended Clifton College. Both of [0]'s parents had died by the time [0] was eighteen.After a tour of the United States with [0]'s brother, [0] studied Political Economy, Ancient History and French Literature at Brasenose College, Oxford, 1880\u20131883. [0] devoted much of [0]'s time to socialising \u2013 [0] was a member of the Bullingdon Club \u2013 and equestrian sports. [0] was one of the best young horsemen at Brasenose College, Oxford and quickly found [0]'s way into the University polo team. While an undergraduate [0] was initiated as a Freemason in Elgin\u2019s Lodge at Leven No. 91 at Leven, Fife, taking the first and second degrees of Freemasonry. In 1920 the Earl of Eglinton encouraged [0] to complete [0]'s Masonic progression, and [0] returned to Elgin\u2019s Lodge at Leven No. 91 at Leven, Fife to take the third degree, subsequently serving as Worshipful Master of Elgin\u2019s Lodge at Leven No. 91 at Leven, Fife from 1925 to 1926. [0] became an officer of the Grand Lodge of Scotland.Although [0] passed [0]'s final exam at Brasenose College, Oxford (a requirement for university applicants to Sandhurst), [0] was not eligible for a degree as [0] had missed a term's residence owing to illness, and if [0] had stayed for longer [0] would have been above the age limit (23) to begin officer training at the Royal Military College at Sandhurst, which [0] entered in January 1884. Because [0] had been to university, [0] was considerably older than most of [0]'s class at Sandhurst. [0] was Senior Under-Officer, was awarded the Anson Sword and passed out first in the order of merit. [0] was commissioned as a lieutenant into the 7th (Queen's Own) Hussars on 7 February 1885."}, "Career": {"Junior officer": "[0] is our person to focus on. Early in [0]'s military career, [0] played polo for England on a tour of the United States (August 1886). [0] would remain a polo enthusiast all his life, serving as Chairman of the Hurlingham Polo Committee from the Hurlingham Polo Committee's reorganization in May 1914 until 1922. [0] would also be President of the Army Polo Committee and founder of the Indian Polo Association.[0] then saw overseas service in India (sent out November 1886), where [0] was appointed the regiment's adjutant in 1888. [0] was something of a disciplinarian, but also impressed [0]'s superiors by [0]'s administrative skill and analysis of recent training exercises. [0] was promoted to captain on 23 January 1891.Haig left India in November 1892 to prepare for the entrance exam for the Staff College, Camberley, which [0] sat in June 1893. Although [0] was placed in the top 28 candidates (the number of places awarded by exam) [0] was not awarded a place as [0] had narrowly failed the compulsory mathematics paper. [0] concealed failed for the rest of his life and later (circa 1910) recommended dropping the compulsory mathematics paper as a requirement. The Adjutant-General Sir Redvers Buller refused to award [0] one of the four nominated places, citing [0]'s colour blindness, despite [0] having [0]'s eyesight rechecked by a German oculist and despite [0]'s glowing testimonials from various senior officers, some of various senior officers lobbied by [0] and [0]'s sister. It has been postulated that The Adjutant-General Sir Redvers Buller was looking for a rationale (colour blindness, the compulsory mathematics paper) in order to give a place to an infantry officer.[0] returned briefly to India (taking time on [0]'s way to write a forty-page report on French cavalry manoeuvres in Touraine) as second-in-command of the squadron which [0] had [0] commanded in 1892, then returned to the United States as Aide-de-camp to Sir Keith Fraser, Inspector General of Cavalry. Sir Keith Fraser, Inspector General of Cavalry was one of those who had lobbied for [0] to enter the Staff College, Camberley, and [0] was finally nominated in late 1894, a common practice in the day for promising candidates. While waiting to take up [0]'s place, [0] travelled to Germany to report on cavalry manoeuvres there, and also served as staff officer to Colonel John French (whom he had met in November 1891 whilst French was Commanding Officer of the 19th Hussars) Colonel John French (whom he had met in November 1891 whilst French was Commanding Officer of the 19th Hussars) on manoeuvres. The careers of Colonel John French (whom he had met in November 1891 whilst French was Commanding Officer of the 19th Hussars) and [0] were to be entwined for the next twenty-five years, and [0] helped Colonel John French (whom he had met in November 1891 whilst French was Commanding Officer of the 19th Hussars) write the cavalry drillbook, published 1896.Haig entered the Staff College, Camberley in 1896, where [0] was apparently not popular with his peer group. For example, his peer group chose Allenby as Master of the Drag Hunt, despite [0] being the better rider. [0] impressed the Chief Instructor, Lt-Col G. F. R. Henderson, and completed the Staff College, Camberley, leaving in 1897. Some writers (e.g. Travers 1987) have criticised the Staff College, Camberley for the Staff College, Camberley's old-fashioned curriculum, which especially influenced [0], as [0] was an absorber of doctrine rather than an original thinker. [0] was taught that victory must come from defeating the main enemy army in battle, and that as in Napoleonic warfare, attrition (the \"wearing out fight\") was merely a prelude to the commitment of reserves for a decisive battlefield victory; traces of this thought can be seen at Loos and the Somme. Great emphasis was placed on morale and mobility, and on Murat's cavalry pursuit after Napoleon's Jena campaign of 1806. Although the American Civil War was studied, the emphasis was on Stonewall Jackson's mobile campaign in the Shenandoah Valley, rather than on the more attritional nature of the American Civil War.", "Mahdist War, 1898": "[0] is our person to focus on. In early January [0] was picked by Evelyn Wood (by then Adjutant-General) as one of three recent staff college graduates requested by Kitchener for a campaign in the Mahdist War in the Sudan. [0] may have been picked to keep an eye on Kitchener, as Evelyn Wood (by then Adjutant-General) invited [0] to write to Kitchener frankly and in confidence. [0] needed little encouragement to (privately) criticise [0]'s superiors \u2013 [0] was especially critical of Kitchener's dictatorial habits. Kitchener's force was Anglo-Egyptian, and [0] was required to formally join the Egyptian Army, most of whose officers were British. The plan had been for [0] to train and take command of an Egyptian cavalry squadron, but take did not happen as Kitchener did not want a command reshuffle with combat imminent. Unlike many British officers, [0] believed that the Egyptians could make good soldiers if properly trained and led. Still without a formal position but accompanying the cavalry, [0] saw [0]'s first action in a skirmish south of Atbara (21 March). In [0]'s report to Evelyn Wood (by then Adjutant-General) about a skirmish south of Atbara (21 March), [0] commented on the lack of British machine guns. While later criticized for [0]'s failure to optimize the use of machine guns, [0] made a special trip to Enfield to study the Maxim Gun, and throughout a campaign in the Mahdist War in the Sudan commented on the Maxim Gun's worth.Four days later [0] was made staff officer of brevet Lieutenant-Colonel Broadwood's's cavalry brigade. [0] distinguished [0] at [0]'s second action, the Battle of Nukheila (6 April) \u2013 where [0] supervised the redeployment of squadrons to protect the rear and then launch a flank attack, as brevet Lieutenant-Colonel Broadwood's was busy in the front line. [0] was present at the Battle of Atbara (8 April), after which he criticised Kitchener for launching a frontal attack without taking the Dervishes in flank as well. During the Battle of Atbara (8 April), after which he criticised Kitchener for launching a frontal attack without taking the Dervishes in flank as well [0] risked [0]'s life rescuing a wounded Egyptian soldier whilst coming under enemy fire, an act which moved several officers present to believe [0] should receive the Victoria Cross. After Atbara, Kitchener was given reinforcements and [0] received a squadron of [0]'s own, which [0] commanded at Omdurman (in reserve during the Battle of Atbara (8 April), then on a flank march into the town afterwards). [0] was promoted to brevet major on 15 November 1898.", "Second Boer War, 1899\u20131902": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] returned to the United Kingdom hoping for a position at the War Office, but was instead appointed (May 1899) brigade major to the 1st Cavalry Brigade at Aldershot.[0] had recently lent \u00a32,500 (in a formal contract with interest) to the brigade commander, John French, to cover the brigade commander, John French's losses from South African mining speculations. lent allowed the brigade commander, John French to maintain the brigade commander, John French's commission. [0] was promoted to the substantive rank of major on 26 June [0] was soon appointed Deputy Assistant Adjutant-General (September 1899) and then Assistant Adjutant General (i.e. chief staff officer) of French's brigade-sized force as French's brigade-sized force was sent off to the Boer War. [0] took part in the brigade commander, John French's first battle, Elandslaagte (18 October, near Ladysmith). the brigade commander, John French were ordered to leave Ladysmith as the four-month siege began, to take charge of the new Cavalry Division arriving from the United Kingdom. French and Haig escaped on the last train to leave Ladysmith (2 November 1899), lying down as the last train to leave Ladysmith passed through enemy fire.As in the Sudan, [0] continued to be sceptical of the importance of artillery, basing [0]'s opinions on interviews with enemy prisoners. After the brigade commander, John French's Colesberg Operations to protect Cape Colony, Frederick Roberts, newly arrived as Commander-in-Chief, appointed Frederick Roberts, newly arrived as Commander-in-Chief,'s , over the brigade commander, John French's protests, to the job of Assistant Adjutant General of the Cavalry Division, with [0]the job of Assistant Adjutant General of the Cavalry Division , as his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Colonel the Earl of Erroll's deputy. Cavalry played a leading role in this stage of the Boer War, including the relief of Kimberley (15 February 1900), which featured a spectacular British cavalry charge at Klip Drift. [0] was briefly (21 February 1900) given command of the 3rd Cavalry Brigade, then made AAG to the new Cavalry Division arriving from the United Kingdom at last after his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Colonel the Earl of Erroll was moved to a different job. the new Cavalry Division arriving from the United Kingdom took part in the capture of Bloemfontein (13 March 1900) and then Pretoria (5 June 1900). [0] privately criticised Frederick Roberts, newly arrived as Commander-in-Chief, for losses to horses (exhaustion and lack of feeding) and men (typhoid) and thought [0] a \"silly old man\".After Frederick Roberts, newly arrived as Commander-in-Chief, had won the conventional war, Kitchener was left in charge of fighting the Boers, who had taken to guerrilla warfare. the new Cavalry Division arriving from the United Kingdom was disbanded (November 1900) and the brigade commander, John French, with [0] still the brigade commander, John French's chief of staff, was put in charge of an all-arms force policing the Johannesburg area, later trying to capture the Boer leader de Wet around Bloemfontein. In January 1901 [0] was given a column of 2,500 men with the local rank of brigadier-general, patrolling Cape Colony, and chasing Commandant Kritzinger. As was standard policy at that time, [0]'s actions included burning farmsteads as part of the scorched earth policies ordered by Kitchener as well as rounding up Boer women and children to be placed in concentration camps.Throughout the Boer War Haig's sister, Henrietta, had been lobbying Evelyn Wood for Haig's sister, Henrietta's to have command of a cavalry regiment of [0]'s own when the Boer War was over. the brigade commander, John French, probably not wanting to part with a valuable assistant, recommended Herbert Lawrence for the vacant command of the 17th Lancers, but Frederick Roberts, newly arrived as Commander-in-Chief, overruled the brigade commander, John French and gave the vacant command of the 17th Lancers to [0] (May 1901). As the 17th Lancers were in South Africa at the time [0] was able to combine the vacant command of the 17th Lancers with that of [0]'s own column.As the Boer War drew to a close [0] had to locate and escort the Boer leader Jan Christiaan Smuts to the peace negotiations at Vereeninging. [0] was mentioned in despatches four times for [0]'s service in South Africa (including by Frederick Roberts, newly arrived as Commander-in-Chief, on 31 March 1900, and by Kitchener on 23 June 1902), and appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in November 1900. [0] was also promoted to the substantive rank of lieutenant colonel on 17 July 1901.Following the end of the Boer War, [0] left Cape Town with 540 officers and men of the 17th Lancers on the SS German in late September 1902. the 17th Lancers was supposed to stay in South Africa but in the end returned home sooner than planned, and arrived at Southampton in late October, when the 17th Lancers were posted to Edinburgh. [0] was appointed an aide-de-camp to King Edward VII in the October 1902 South Africa Honours list, with the brevet rank of colonel (thus keeping the brevet rank of colonel instead of reverting to the substantive lower rank).", "Inspector-General of Cavalry, India": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] continued as the commanding officer of the 17th Lancers until 1903, stationed in Edinburgh. [0] was then appointed Inspector-General of Cavalry in British India ([0] would have preferred command of the cavalry brigade at Aldershot, where French was now General Officer Commanding (GOC)), but had first to spend a year on garrison duty at Edinburgh until the previous incumbent completed the previous incumbent's term).Haig's war service had earned [0] belated but rapid promotion: having been a captain until the relatively advanced age of thirty-seven, by 1904 [0] had become the youngest major-general in the British Army at that time. [0] was present at the Rawalpindi Parade 1905 to honour the Prince and Princess of Wales' visit to British India. At this time a great deal of the energies of the most senior British generals were taken up with the question of whether cavalry should still be trained to charge with sword and lance (the view of French and [0]) as well as using horses for mobility then fighting dismounted with firearms. Lord Roberts, now Commander-in-Chief of the British Army, warned Kitchener (now Commander-in-Chief, India) to be \"very firm with [0]\" on the question of whether cavalry should still be trained to charge with sword and lance (in the event Kitchener (now Commander-in-Chief, India) was soon distracted, from 1904, by Kitchener (now Commander-in-Chief, India)'s quarrel with the Viceroy Lord Curzon, who eventually resigned), and wrote that [0] was a \"clever, able fellow\" who had great influence over French.", "Marriage and children": "[0] is our person to focus on. On leave from India, [0] married Hon Dorothy Maud Vivian (1879\u20131939) on 11 July 1905 after a whirlwind courtship (Hon Dorothy Maud Vivian (1879\u20131939) had spotted [0] for the first time when [0] was playing polo at Hurlingham two years earlier). Hon Dorothy Maud Vivian (1879\u20131939) was a daughter of Hussey Vivian, 3rd Baron Vivian and Louisa Duff.:\u200a562\u200aThe couple had four children:[0] had used [0]'s leave in 1905 to lobby for a job at the War Office, but lobby was rejected by H. O. Arnold-Forster the Secretary of State for War as too blatantly relying on royal influence.", "War Office": "[0] is our person to focus on. The Boer War had exposed Britain's's lack of a general staff and modern reserve army. In the new Liberal Government (December 1905), Richard Haldane, Secretary of State for War, implemented the Esher recommendations accepted in principle by the outgoing Conservative government. In August 1906 [0] was appointed Director of Military Training on the General Staff at the War Office. Richard Haldane, Secretary of State for War, later wrote that [0] had \"a first rate general staff mind\" and \"gave invaluable advice\" [0] in turn would later dedicate a volume of [0]'s despatches to Richard Haldane, Secretary of State for War,. Although both men later claimed that the Esher recommendations accepted in principle by the outgoing Conservative government had been to prepare Britain's for continental war, both men did not create a continental-sized army and it would be truer to say that both men created a small professional army within a budget, with conscription politically impossible despite Lord Roberts' campaigning.the Esher recommendations accepted in principle by the outgoing Conservative government reorganised the militia, yeomanry and volunteers into the new Territorial Force. [0] was intolerant of what [0] regarded as old-fashioned opinions and not good at negotiating with strangers. the militia were the last to agree, and had to be turned into a Special Reserve by Act of Parliament. [0] had wanted a reserve of 900,000 men, but Richard Haldane, Secretary of State for War, settled for a more realistic 300,000.Haig's skills at administration and organising training and inspections were better employed in setting up an Expeditionary Force of 120,000 men (6 infantry divisions and 1 cavalry \u2013 the force which would be deployed to France in 1914) in 1907. As an intimate of Richard Haldane, Secretary of State for War, [0] was able to ensure high priority for cavalry, less for artillery, contrary to the advice of Lord Roberts'Lord Roberts' campaigning Richard Haldane, Secretary of State for War,. [0]'s records of [0]'s time supervising artillery exercises show little interest in technical matters (aim, range, accuracy etc.).In November 1907 [0] was moved sideways to Director of Staff Duties. [0] required commanders to take the staff officers assigned to commanders (rather than choose commanders's own by patronage) and also assigned staff officers to the new Territorial Force. [0] supervised publication of \"Field Service Regulations\", which was later very useful in expanding the BEF in WW1, although \"Field Service Regulations\", which was later very useful in expanding the BEF in WW1 still stressed the importance of cavalry charging with sword and lance as well as fighting dismounted. At this time [0] was also completing a separate work, \"Cavalry Studies\" (on which topic [0]'s admiring biographer James Marshall-Cornwall later wrote that [0] was \"not \u2026 among the prophets\"), and devoting much time to cavalry exercises. [0] was also involved in setting up the Imperial General Staff (larger colonies were to have local sections of the Imperial General Staff, with trained staff officers), for which [0]'s work was praised by Richard Haldane, Secretary of State for War,.", "Chief of Staff, India": "[0] is our person to focus on. By 1909 it seemed likely to Haldane and [0] that an Anglo-German War loomed and [0] was at first reluctant to accept appointment as Chief of the General Staff in India. [0] passed the Director of Staff Duties job to [0]'s loyal follower Brigadier-General Kiggell (later Chief of Staff BEF), to whom [0] wrote with \"advice\" every fortnight. [0] [0]'s was promoted to lieutenant-general in November 1910. In India [0] had hoped to develop the Indian General Staff as part of the greater Imperial General Staff, and to organise despatch of Indian troops to a future European War. A plan [0] envisaged for mobilising the British Indian Army to send to Europe in the event of war there was vetoed by Viceroy Lord Hardinge. In the event an Indian Corps would serve on the Western Front early in the conflict, and Indian troops were also used in comparatively small formations the Middle East.", "Aldershot": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] left India in December 1911, and took up an appointment as General Officer Commanding Aldershot Command (1st & 2nd Divisions and 1st Cavalry Brigade) in March 1912.In the Army Manoeuvres of 1912 [0] was decisively beaten by Sir James Grierson despite having the odds in Sir James Grierson's favour, because of Sir James Grierson's superior use of air reconnaissance. At dinner afterwards [0] abandoned [0]'s prepared text, and although [0] wrote that his remarks were \"well received\", John Charteris recorded that his remarks were \"unintelligible and unbearably dull\" and that the visiting dignitaries fell asleep. [0]'s poor public speaking skills aside, the Army Manoeuvres of 1912 were thought to have shown the reformed army efficient.", "": ""}, "First World War": {"1914": "[0] is our person to focus on. During the Curragh Mutiny (March 1914) [0] urged caution on his chief of staff John Gough, whose brother Hubert Gough (then a cavalry brigadier, later GOC Fifth Army during the First World War) was threatening to resign rather than coerce Ulstermen into a semi-independent Ireland. [0] stressed that the army's duty was to keep the peace and urged [0]'s officers not to dabble in politics. Sir John French was forced to resign as CIGS, after having made the error of putting in writing a promise that officers would not be required to coerce Ulstermen; [0] respected his chief of staff John Gough, whose brother Hubert Gough (then a cavalry brigadier, later GOC Fifth Army during the First World War)'s principled stand but felt Sir John French had allowed Sir John French to be used as a political tool by H. H. Asquith.Upon the outbreak of war in August 1914, [0] helped organize the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), commanded by Field Marshal Sir John French. As planned, [0]'s Aldershot command was formed into I Corps. In a letter to Haldane (4 August), [0] predicted that war would last for months if not years; [0] wanted Haldane to return to the War Office (H. H. Asquith had been holding the War Office since the resignation of Seeley during the Curragh Mutiny (March 1914) \u2013 the War Office was given to Kitchener) and delay sending the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), commanded by Field Marshal Sir John French to France until the Territorial Army had been mobilised and incorporated.[0] attended the War Council (5 August), at which it was decided that it was too dangerous to mobilise forward in France at Maubeuge near the Belgian border, as British mobilisation was running three days behind that of France and Germany (i.e. the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), commanded by Field Marshal Sir John French might be overrun by the Germans as the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), commanded by Field Marshal Sir John French formed up). There were no other contingency plans \u2013 [0] and Kitchener proposed that the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), commanded by Field Marshal Sir John French would be better positioned to counter-attack in Amiens. Sir John French suggested landing at Antwerp, which was vetoed by Winston Churchill as the Royal Navy could not guarantee safe passage. A critical biographer writes that [0] was \"more clear-sighted than many of [0]'s colleagues\".In Sir John French's much-criticised memoirs 1914, Sir John French later claimed that [0] had wanted to postpone sending the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), commanded by Field Marshal Sir John French, which may be partly true, in view of what [0] had written to Haldane at the time. [0] was so angry at this claim that [0] asked Cabinet Secretary Maurice Hankey to correct Sir John French's \"inaccuracies\". However [0] also rewrote [0]'s diary from this period, possibly to show [0] in a better light and Sir John French in a poor one. The original manuscript diary for early August does not survive but there is no positive evidence that The original manuscript diary for early August was destroyed; and it has been pointed out that it is just as likely that the extant typed version was prepared from dictation or notes now lost. Cabinet Secretary Maurice Hankey's notes of the meeting record that [0] suggested delaying or sending smaller forces, but was willing to send forces if France was in danger of defeat or if France wanted forces (which France did). [0] predicted that war would last several years and that an army of a million men, trained by officers and NCOs withdrawn from the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), commanded by Field Marshal Sir John French, would be needed.[0] had been appointed aide-de-camp to King George V in February 1914. During a royal inspection of Aldershot (11 August), [0] told King George V that [0] had \"grave doubts\" about the evenness of French's temper and military knowledge. [0] later claimed that \"grave doubts\" about the evenness of French's temper and military knowledge had gone back to the Boer War but there appears to have been an element of later embellishment about claimed; [0] had in fact praised Sir John French during the Boer War and had welcomed Sir John French's appointment as CIGS in 1911.Haig crossed over to Le Havre. the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), commanded by Field Marshal Sir John French landed in France on 14 August and advanced into Belgium, where Sir John French took up positions on the left of General Lanrezac's French Fifth Army at Charleroi. [0] was irritated by Sir John French (influenced by Henry Wilson into putting Henry Wilson's faith in a French thrust up from the Ardennes) who was only concerned with the three German corps in front of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), commanded by Field Marshal Sir John French at Mons and who ignored intelligence reports of German forces streaming westwards from Brussels, threatening an encirclement from the British left. Although II Corps fought off the German attack at Mons on 23 August (the first British encounter with the Germans) the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), commanded by Field Marshal Sir John French was forced to withdraw after Lanzerac ordered a retreat exposing the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), commanded by Field Marshal Sir John French's right flank as well.The retreats of I and II Corps had to be conducted separately because of the Mormal Forest. I and II Corps were supposed to meet at Le Cateau but I Corps under [0] were stopped at Landrecies, leaving a large gap between I and II Corps. [0]'s reactions to II Corps's skirmish with German forces at Landrecies (during which [0] led his staff into the street, revolvers drawn, promising to \"sell his staff's lives dearly\") caused [0] to send an exaggerated report to Sir John French, which caused Sir John French to panic. The following day 26 August, Horace Smith-Dorrien's II Corps engaged the enemy in the Battle of Le Cateau, which was unsupported by Haig. the Battle of Le Cateau, which was unsupported by Haig slowed the German army's advance. However, a critical biographer writes that too much has been made of the \"moment of panic\" at Landrecies, and that the 200-mile (320\u00a0km) retreat, over a period of 13 days, is a tribute to the \"steady and competent leadership\" of [0] and Horace Smith-Dorrien's.On 25 August the French commander Joseph Joffre ordered the French commander Joseph Joffre's to retreat to the Marne, which compelled the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), commanded by Field Marshal Sir John French to further withdraw. [0] was irritated by the high-handed behaviour of Sir John French, seizing roads which Sir John French had promised for British use and refusing to promise to cover the British right flank. [0] complained privately of French unreliability and lack of fighting competence, a complaint which [0] would keep up for the next four years. [0] wrote to [0]'s wife that [0] wished the British were operating independently from Antwerp, a proposal which [0] had rejected as \"reckless\", when Sir John French had made it at the War Council on 4 August.retreat caused Sir John French to question the competence of Sir John French's Allies resulting in further indecision and led to Sir John French's decision to withdraw the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), commanded by Field Marshal Sir John French south of the Seine. On 1 September, Kitchener intervened by visiting Sir John French and ordering Sir John French to re-enter the battle and coordinate with the French commander Joseph Joffre's . The battle to defend Paris began on 5 September and became known as the first Battle of the Marne. [0] had wanted to rest II Corps but was happy to resume the offensive when ordered. [0] drove on his subordinates, including Ivor Maxse, when [0] thought his subordinates, including Ivor Maxse lacking in \"fighting spirit\". Although Sir John French praised [0]'s leadership of II Corps, [0] was privately contemptuous of Sir John French's overconfidence prior to Mons and excessive caution thereafter.On 15 October, later than proposed after two weeks of friction between British and French generals, II Corps was moved to Ypres in Flanders as part of the \"Race to the Sea\". In the belief that the German northern flank was weak, [0] was ordered to march on Ghent, Bruges and Courtrai in western Belgium but the new German Chief of Staff Falkenhayn was trying to do the opposite and roll up the German northern flank. II Corps marched headlong into a thrust westward by fresh German forces and the result was the Battle of Le Cateau, which was unsupported by Haig. German forces, equipped with 250 heavy guns (a large number for this early stage in war), outnumbered II Corps by two to one and came close to success. At one point [0] mounted [0]'s white horse to encourage [0]'s men, who were retreating around Gheluvelt, although in the event Gheluvelt had just been recaptured by a battalion of the Worcesters before [0]'s ride. [0] cemented [0]'s reputation at the Battle of Le Cateau, which was unsupported by Haig and Ypres in Flanders remained a symbolic piece of ground in later years. [0] was also influenced by the fact that Sir John French had called off Sir John French's when Sir John French were on the verge of success, and [0] drew the lesson that attacks needed to be kept up so long as there was any chance of success.After a fortnight of intense fighting II Corps had been reduced from 18,000 men to just under 3,000 effectives by 12 November. After six days of bickering between British and French generals, II Corps was relieved by French troops; [0] being very suspicious of the pro-French sympathies of Henry Wilson. Following the success of the Battle of Le Cateau, which was unsupported by Haig, Sir John FrenchSir John French's Sir John French's , recommended [0] for immediate promotion to general. [0] travelled to London on Sir John French's behalf (23 November) to consult Kitchener about the plan to expand the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), commanded by Field Marshal Sir John French and reorganise the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), commanded by Field Marshal Sir John French into two armies.At this point it was thought that war would end once the Germans were defeated by the Russians at Lodz and the difficulties of attacking on the Western Front were not yet appreciated. A failed attack by Horace Smith-Dorrien's II Corps on Messines\u2013Wytschaete (14\u201315 December) was blamed on poor GHQ staff work, and on 18 December, [0] met Sir John FrenchSir John French the BEF chief of staff Murray, whose performance had been unsatisfactory throughout the campaign the BEF chief of staff Murray, whose performance had been unsatisfactory throughout the campaign's . [0] thought that his deputy Henry Wilson, besides being too pro-French, had \"no military knowledge\" and recommended Quarter-Master General \"Wully\" Robertson for the vacancy. recommended was also the view of Kitchener, so Quarter-Master General \"Wully\" Robertson received the promotion. [0] received promotion to general on 16 November 1914.", "1915": "Douglas Haig is our person to focus on. Like French, Haig wanted to push along the North Sea Coast to Ostend and Zeebrugge but Joffre did not want the British acting so independently. [0] had recently sent eight infantry divisions to the Eastern Front, with twelve newly raised divisions, reducing [0]'s net strength in the west from 106 divisions at the time of First Ypres to 98, so French and Joffre, thinking that the war would be won by the summer, agreed that a French offensive in Artois and Champagne, should be accompanied by a British offensive at Neuve-Chapelle to be conducted by Haig, as Joffre trusted Haig more than Smith-Dorrien, after Smith-Dorrien's failure at Messines in December. At Neuve-Chapelle, Haig wanted a quick bombardment and his subordinate Henry Rawlinson (GOC IV Corps), a longer and more methodical one. Shortage of shells meant that only a thirty-five-minute bombardment was possible but the small front of the attack gave the attack the concentration to succeed.Haig displayed great interest in the potential of aircraft and met Major Trenchard of the Royal Flying Corps (16 February) to organise photographic air reconnaissance and a map of German lines was obtained; aircraft were also beginning to be used for artillery spotting \u2013 signalling to British batteries by Morse \u2013 observing enemy troop movements and bombing German rear areas. Four divisions attacked at the Battle of Neuve Chapelle on 10 March and penetrated to a depth of 1,600 yards (1,500\u00a0m) but no progress was made on subsequent days, as [0] were able to bring in reinforcements. Casualties were around 12,000 on each side. The Official History later claimed that Neuve-Chapelle was to show French the attacking ability of British troops and that Neuve-Chapelle was the first time the German line had been broken. his subordinate Henry Rawlinson (GOC IV Corps) had wanted to end the attack after 10 March and Haig felt that reserves should have been committed quicker. On his subordinate Henry Rawlinson (GOC IV Corps)'s suggestion Haig came close to sacking Major-General Joey Davies (GOC 8th Division) until it was found that Major-General Joey Davies (GOC 8th Division) had followed his subordinate Henry Rawlinson (GOC IV Corps)'s orders; Haig reprimanded his subordinate Henry Rawlinson (GOC IV Corps) but thought his subordinate Henry Rawlinson (GOC IV Corps) too valuable to sack. This may have made his subordinate Henry Rawlinson (GOC IV Corps) reluctant to stand up to Haig thereafter.French and Joffre still expected victory by July. Whilst [0] attacked Smith-Dorrien at the Second Battle of Ypres (April), new Allied offensives were planned by French at Vimy and by Haig at Aubers Ridge (9 May). It was believed on the British side that the lessons of Neuve-Chapelle had been learned \u2013 reserves were ready to exploit and mortars were ready to support attackers who had advanced beyond artillery cover \u2013 and that this time success would be complete not partial. the attack was less successful than Neuve-Chapelle as the forty-minute bombardment (only 516 field guns and 121 heavy guns) was over a wider front and against stronger defences; Haig was still focussed on winning a decisive victory by capturing key ground, rather than amassing firepower to inflict maximum damage on [0]. Attacks (at Festubert, 15\u201325 May) as a diversion, gained 1,100 yards (1,000\u00a0m) over a front of 4,400 yards (4,000\u00a0m), with 16,000 British casualties to around 6,600 German losses. French was satisfied that Attacks (at Festubert, 15\u201325 May) as a diversion, had served to take pressure off French at French's request but Haig still felt that German reserves were being exhausted, bringing victory nearer.Lack of shells at new Allied offensives was, along with Admiral Fisher's resignation over the failed Dardanelles Campaign, a cause of the fall of the Liberal Government (19 May). Haig did not approve of the Northcliffe press attacks on Kitchener, whom he thought a powerful military voice against the folly of civilians like Churchill (despite the fact that Kitchener, whom he thought a powerful military voice against the folly of civilians like Churchill had played a role in planning the Gallipoli expedition and was an opponent of the strong General Staff which Haig wanted to see). French had been leaking information about the shell shortage to Charles \u00e0 Court Repington of The Times, whom Haig detested and which Haig likened to \"carrying on with a whore\" (possibly a deliberately chosen analogy in view of French's womanising). French also communicated with Conservative leaders and to David Lloyd George who now became Minister of Munitions in the new coalition government.Haig was asked by Clive Wigram (one of the King's's press staff) to smooth relations between French and KitchenerKitchener, whom he thought a powerful military voice against the folly of civilians like Churchill. At Robertson's's suggestion, Haig received Kitchener, whom he thought a powerful military voice against the folly of civilians like Churchill at Haig's HQ (8 July \u2013 despite French's attempt to block the meeting), where French and Kitchener shared French and Kitchener's concerns about French. French and Kitchener met again in London (14 July), whilst Haig was receiving Haig's GCB (awarded on French's recommendation after Neuve-Chapelle) from the King, who also complained to him about French. Over lunch with the King, who also complained to him about French and Kitchener, whom he thought a powerful military voice against the folly of civilians like Churchill, Haig remarked that the best time to sack French would have been after the retreat to the Marne; it was agreed that French and Kitchener would correspond in confidence and in response to the King, who also complained to him about French's joke that correspond was inviting Haig to \"sneak\" like a schoolboy, Kitchener, whom he thought a powerful military voice against the folly of civilians like Churchill replied that \"French and Kitchener are past schoolboy's age\".Haig had long thought French petty, jealous, unbalanced (\"like a bottle of soda water \u2026 incapable of thinking \u2026 and coming to a reasoned decision\"), overly quick to meddle in party politics and easily manipulated by Henry Wilson. Haig was increasingly irritated by French's changes of orders and mercurial changes of mood as to the length of the war, which French now expected to last into 1916. Haig still thought [0] might collapse by November, although at the same time Haig was sending a memo to the War Office recommending that the BEF, now numbering 25 divisions, be equipped with the maximum number of heavy guns, ready for a huge decisive battle, 36 divisions strong in 1916.The war was not going well \u2013 besides the failure at Cape Helles (landing 25 April), Bulgaria had joined the Central Powers (Serbia was soon overrun) and Italian attacks on the Isonzo had made negligible progress. Allied attacks in the west were needed to take pressure off the Russians, who were being flung out of Poland (after the Fall of Warsaw, 5 August). The original plan was to attack in July. At Joffre's insistence the attack was planned next to the French Tenth Army at Loos.Haig inspected the Loos area (24 June) and expressed dissatisfaction with the ground; slag heaps and pit head towers which made good observation points for the Germans. French later did the same and agreed. French and Joffre would have preferred to renew attackedAubers Ridge. Joffre was not pleased and called another conference (11 July) to urge a British attack on Loos. Haig pushed for Aubers Ridge again (22 July) \u2013 French at first agreed until dissuaded by Foch (29 July), who felt that only a British attack at Loos would pull in enough German reserves to allow French to take Vimy. French wrote to Joffre saying French was willing to go along with these plans for the sake of Anglo-French cooperation, but then wrote to Joffre again (10 August) suggesting an artillery bombardment with only limited British infantry attacks. an artillery bombardment with only limited British infantry attacks was not what Joffre wanted. Kitchener, whom he thought a powerful military voice against the folly of civilians like Churchill listened sympathetically to Joffre's suggestion that in future Joffre should set the size, dates and objectives of British offensives, although Kitchener, whom he thought a powerful military voice against the folly of civilians like Churchill only agreed for the attack for the moment. Kitchener, whom he thought a powerful military voice against the folly of civilians like Churchill met with Haig first and then with French. It is unclear exactly why Kitchener, whom he thought a powerful military voice against the folly of civilians like Churchill and then Haig agreed to go along with Joffre's wishes \u2013 possibly the disastrous plight of the Russians, who were being flung out of Poland (after the Fall of Warsaw, 5 August), but it may be that a promise that poison gas could be used may have persuaded Haig. Having got French's own way, French then postponed the attack as French picked new attacking ground in Champagne and arranged for extra shelling at Vimy, in both cases because of the very reasons \u2013 German-held villages and other obstructions \u2013 to which the British generals had objected.Only 850 guns (110 of them heavy) were available, too few for concentrated bombardment over a frontage far wider than at Neuve-Chapelle (in 1915 the Germans had 10,500 guns of which 3,350 were heavy, whilst the British had only around 1,500, not to mention the shortage of ammunition). There was also argument over the placement of the reserve, XI Corps (Haking) with the 21st and 24th Divisions (inexperienced New Army divisions), which Haig wanted close to the front. Despite not originally wanting the attack, Haig had persuaded Haig that decisive victory was possible, and it may be that French wanted to keep control of the reserve to stop the reserve being thrown into battle needlessly. French tried in vain to forbid Haig to discuss these plans with Kitchener, whom he thought a powerful military voice against the folly of civilians like Churchill (on the grounds that Kitchener, whom he thought a powerful military voice against the folly of civilians like Churchill might leak these plans to politicians). Battle began (25 September) after Haig ordered the release of chlorine gas (Haig had an aide, Alan Fletcher, light a cigarette to test the wind).The attack failed in the north against the Hohenzollern Redoubt but broke through the German first line in the centre (Loos and Hill 70). the reserve were tired after night marches, to reach the front in secrecy and were not available until 2\u00a0pm, but were thrown into battle without success on the second day, although it is not clear that the reserve would have accomplished much if available on 10 March, as Haig had wanted.the reserve now became a stick with which to beat French. Haig wrote a detailed letter to Kitchener, whom he thought a powerful military voice against the folly of civilians like Churchill (29 Sep) claiming \"complete\"  [sic] success on 10 March and complaining that the reserve had not been placed as close to the front as agreed (placed turned out to be untrue) and that French had not released control of the reserve when requested (French had but delays in communications and traffic control had meant that the reserve were not available until 2\u00a0pm). French protested that time for the commitment of reserves had been on the second day; when told of been by Robertson's (2 Oct) Haig thought been evidence of French's \"unreasoning brain\". Haig strengthened Haig's case by reports that captured enemy officers had been astonished at the British failure to exploit the attack and by complaining about the government's foot-dragging at introducing conscription and the commitment of troops to sideshows like Salonika and Suvla Bay (6 August), at a time when the Germans were calling up the Germans's 1918 Class early.The failure of Loos was debated in the British press. Kitchener, whom he thought a powerful military voice against the folly of civilians like Churchill demanded a report (6 October) and Lord Haldane (a former Cabinet Minister) was sent to France to interview French and Joffre. French in turn demanded a report from Haig, in particular Haig's claim to have penetrated the German lines (16 Oct). Haig claimed in Haig's diary that a proposal that Haig be sent to report on the Gallipoli bridgehead, was shelved because of the imminence of French's removal. Lord Stamfordham, the King's's Secretary, telephoned Robertson's to ask Robertson's's opinion of French and Robertson's conferred with Haig Robertson's the Imperial General Staff \u2013 before giving Robertson's's opinion. the King's also discussed the matter with Haig over dinner on a visit to the front (24 October). Haig again told the King's that French should have been sacked in August 1914. Four days later the King's, whilst inspecting troops, was injured when thrown by one of Haig's horses and had to be evacuated to England on a stretcher, which caused Haig some embarrassment. French was reduced to having French's orders releasing the reserve published in The Times (2 November), along with an article by Repington blaming Haig. Haig demanded a correction of French's \"inaccuracies\" about the availability of the reserve, whereupon French ordered Haig to cease all correspondence on this matter, although French offered to let Haig see the covering letter French was sending to London in French's report but French's fate was sealed. Haig met with the Prime Minister, H. H. Asquith on 2 November and Bonar Law (Conservative Leader) the next day. Rumours were rife that French was to be sacked, another reason given for sacking French, was that French's shortcomings would become more pronounced with the expansion of the BEF, which would number sixty divisions within two years. Matters had been delayed as Kitchener, whom he thought a powerful military voice against the folly of civilians like Churchill was away on an inspection tour of the Mediterranean and French was sick in bed. Kitchener, whom he thought a powerful military voice against the folly of civilians like Churchill returned to London (3 Dec) and at a meeting with Haig 3 Dec, told Haig that Kitchener, whom he thought a powerful military voice against the folly of civilians like Churchill was to recommend to the Prime Minister, H. H. Asquith that Haig replace French.Haig's appointment as Commander-in-Chief BEF was announced on 10 December and almost simultaneously Robertson's became Chief of the Imperial General Staff in London, reporting directly to the Cabinet rather than to the War Secretary. French and Joffre hoped that became would be the start of a new and more professional management of the war. Monro was promoted to GOC First Army in Haig's place, not Rawlinson whom Haig would have preferred and for reasons of seniority Haig was forced to accept the weak-willed Launcelot Kiggell, not Butler as chief of staff BEF in succession to Robertson's. French and Joffre had a final handover meeting (18 December, the day before the formal change of command), at which Haig agreed that Churchill \u2013 recently resigned from the Cabinet and vetoed from command of a brigade \u2013 should be given command of a battalion.", "1916": "[0] is our person to focus on. For the first time (2 January) [0] attended church service with George Duncan, who was to have great influence over [0]. [0] saw [0] as God's servant and was keen to have clergymen sent out whose sermons would remind the men that the war dead were martyrs in a just cause.Robertson and Kitchener (who thought that an offensive starting in March, could bring decisive victory by August and peace by November) wanted to concentrate on the Western Front, unlike many in the Cabinet who preferred Salonika or Mesopotamia. [0] and Robertson were aware that Britain would have to take on more of the offensive burden, as France was beginning to run out of men (and perhaps could not last more than another year at the same level of effort) but thought that the Germans might retreat in the Western Front to shorten the Germans's line, so the Germans could concentrate on beating the Russians, who unlike France and Britain might accept a compromise peace. [0] thought that the Germans had already had plenty of \"wearing out\", that a decisive victory was possible in 1916 and urged Robertson (9 Jan) to recruit more cavalry. [0]'s preference was to regain control of the Belgian coast by attacking in Flanders, to bring the Belgian coast and the naval bases at Bruges, Zeebrugge and Ostend (a view also held by the Cabinet and Admiralty since 1914) into Allied hands and where the Germans would also suffer great loss if the Germans were reluctant to retreat.Lloyd George visited [0] at GHQ and afterwards wrote to [0], to say that Lloyd George had been impressed by [0]'s \"grip\" and by the \"trained thought of a great soldier\". Subsequent relations between the two men were not to be so cordial. [0] thought Lloyd George \"shifty and unreliable\". [0] and Kiggell met Joffre and Joffre's chief of staff de Castelnau at Chantilly (14 February). [0] thought that politicians and the public might misunderstand a long period of attrition and thought that only a fortnight of \"wearing out\", not three months as Joffre had originally wanted, would be needed before the decisive offensive. Arguments continued over the British taking over more front line from the French. [0] had thought that the German troops reported near Verdun were a feint prior to an attack on the British but the Verdun Offensive began on 21 February.In March 1916 GHQ was moved from Saint-Omer to Montreuil, Pas-de-Calais. Montreuil, Pas-de-Calais was close to ports and endowed with a well-developed infrastructure in the form of a military academy. For [0]'s residence [0] commandeered Beaurepaire House which was a few kilometres SE of Montreuil, Pas-de-Calais.[0] decided that Verdun had \"worn down\" the Germans enough and that a decisive victory was possible at once. the Cabinet were less optimistic and Kitchener (like Rawlinson) was also somewhat doubtful and would have preferred smaller and purely attritional attacks but sided with Robertson in telling the Cabinet that the Somme offensive should go ahead. [0] attended a Cabinet meeting in London (15 April) where the politicians were more concerned with the political crisis over the introduction of conscription, which could bring down the government and [0] recorded that Asquith attended a Cabinet meeting in London (15 April) dressed for golf and clearly keen to get away for the weekend.the French had already insisted on an Anglo-French attack at the Somme, where British and French troops were adjacent, to relieve the pressure on the French Army at Verdun, although the French component of an Anglo-French attack at the Somme, where British and French troops were adjacent was gradually reduced as reinforcements went to Verdun. [0] wanted to delay until 15 August, to allow for more training and more artillery to be available. When told of delay Joffre shouted at [0] that \"the French Army would cease to exist\" and had to be calmed down with \"liberal doses of 1840 brandy\". the British refused to agree to French demands for a joint Anglo-French offensive from the Salonika bridgehead. Eventually, perhaps influenced by reports of French troop disturbances at Verdun, [0] agreed to attack on 29 June (later put back until 1 July). agreed was just in time, as it later turned out that P\u00e9tain at Verdun was warning the government that the \"game was up\" unless the British attacked.the government was concerned at the volume of shipping space being used for fodder and wanted to cut the number of cavalry divisions. [0] opposed cut, believing that cavalry would still be needed to exploit the imminent victory. the Cabinet were mistaken, as most of the fodder was for the horses, donkeys and mules which the BEF used to move supplies and heavy equipment. Discussing this matter with the King, who thought the war would last until the end of 1917, [0] told the King, who thought the war would last until the end of 1917 that Germany would collapse by the end of 1916. This round of planning ended with a sharp exchange of letters with the Cabinet, [0] rebuked the Cabinet for interfering in military matters and declared that \"[0] am responsible for the efficiency of the Armies in France\". Lloyd George thought [0]'s letter \"perfectly insolent\" and that the government \"had the right to investigate any matter connected with the war that the government pleased\".From 1 July to 18 November 1916, [0] directed the British portion of the Battle of the Somme. the French wanted [0] to persist with the offensive and insisted throughout the Battle of the Somme, even after the French went on the offensive at Verdun in October 1916. Although too much shrapnel was used in the initial bombardment for 1 July, [0] was not entirely to blame for used \u2013 as early as Jan 1915 [0] had been impressed by evidence of the effectiveness of high explosive shells and had demanded as many of high explosive shells as possible from van Donop (Head of Ordnance in Britain).", "1917": "[0] is our person to focus on. On 1 January 1917, [0] was made a field marshal. The King (George V) wrote [0] a handwritten note ending: \"The King (George V) hope [0] will look upon made as a New Year's gift from The King (George V) and the country\". Lloyd George, who had become Prime Minister in December 1916, infuriated Haig and Robertson by placing the BEF under the command of the new French Commander-in-Chief Robert Nivelle, at a stormy conference at Calais. The failure of the the new French Commander-in-Chief Robert Nivelle Offensive in April 1917 (which [0] had been required to support with a British offensive by the Third and First Armies at Arras) and the subsequent French mutiny and political crisis, discredited Lloyd George, who had become Prime Minister in December 1916,'s plans for Anglo-French co-operation for the time being. During the second half of 1917, [0] conducted an offensive at Passchendaele (the Third Battle of Ypres). [0] hoped to break through and liberate the North Sea coast of Belgium from which German U-boats were operating, provided that there was assistance from the French, support from Britain and that Russia stayed in the war.The Admiralty, led by John Jellicoe, believed that the U-boat threat could jeopardise Britain's ability to continue fighting into 1918. Another objective was to commit German resources to Belgian Flanders, away from the Aisne sector in France, where the French mutiny had been worst, in order to give the French Army time to recover. In addition to [0]'s immediate objectives, [0] was also worried that the Russian Revolution would result in Russia and Germany making peace and forming an alliance. If making happened the million or so German troops located on the Eastern Front would be transferred to the west by late 1917 or early 1918. If transferred occurred, a decisive victory would be much more difficult to obtain.an offensive at Passchendaele (the Third Battle of Ypres) caused the British far fewer casualties than the Battle of the Somme and the substantial success of the occupation of the ridges around Ypres, the first stage of the offensive strategy and inflicted comparable losses on the Germans, who were far less capable of replacing losses and which contributed to their defeat in 1918the Germans, who were far less capable of replacing losses and which contributed to their defeat in 1918's . When he asked the Canadian Corps commander, Arthur Currie, to capture Passchendaele Ridge during the final month of the battle, the Canadian Corps commander, Arthur Currie, flatly replied \"capture's suicidal. the Canadian Corps commander, Arthur Currie, will not waste 16,000 good soldiers on such a hopeless objective\" and then did as the Canadian Corps commander, Arthur Currie, was told.By the end of 1917, Lloyd George, who had become Prime Minister in December 1916, felt able to assert authority over the generals and at the end of 1917 was able to sack the First Sea Lord Admiral Jellicoe. Over the objections of Haig and Robertson, an inter-Allied Supreme War Council was set up. En route to a meeting in Paris to discuss this (1 November), Lloyd George, who had become Prime Minister in December 1916, told Wilson, Smuts and Hankey that Lloyd George, who had become Prime Minister in December 1916, was toying with the idea of sending [0] to command the British and French forces in Italy. At a meeting in Paris to discuss this (1 November), Lloyd George, who had become Prime Minister in December 1916, accused [0] of encouraging press attacks on Lloyd George, who had become Prime Minister in December 1916,. [0] was making similar complaints about Lloyd George, who had become Prime Minister in December 1916,. [0] volunteered to write to J. A. Spender, pro-Asquith editor of the Westminster Gazette but Lloyd George, who had become Prime Minister in December 1916, begged [0] not to. [0] wrote \"[0] gave Lloyd George, who had become Prime Minister in December 1916, a good talking-to on several of the questions that Lloyd George, who had become Prime Minister in December 1916, raised, and felt [0] got the best of the arguments\", a view which does not reflect the later reputations of Haig and RobertsonLloyd George, who had become Prime Minister in December 1916,.At the Versailles meeting, when an inter-Allied Supreme War Council was inaugurated (11 November), Lloyd George, who had become Prime Minister in December 1916, attributed the success of the Central Powers to unity and scoffed at recent Allied \"victories\", saying Lloyd George, who had become Prime Minister in December 1916, wished \"it had not been necessary to win so many of recent Allied \"victories\"\". Lloyd George, who had become Prime Minister in December 1916,'s angered several leading politicians, Carson repudiated His speech and Derby assured [0] of Derby's backing. [0] thought that Lloyd George, who had become Prime Minister in December 1916,'s political position was weak and Lloyd George, who had become Prime Minister in December 1916, would not last another six weeks (thought was a false prediction, although Lloyd George, who had become Prime Minister in December 1916, did not have full freedom of action in a coalition government, Lloyd George, who had become Prime Minister in December 1916,'s personal drive and appeal to certain sections of the public made Lloyd George, who had become Prime Minister in December 1916, indispensable as Prime Minister). Haig and Robertson objected to a common command, arguing that coalitions work better when one power is dominant, which was no longer the case, now that British military power had increased relative to that of France.Lloyd George, who had become Prime Minister in December 1916, got Lloyd George, who had become Prime Minister in December 1916,'s wish to send British forces to Italy, after the Italian defeat at Caporetto in November. Plumer was moved to Italy with five divisions and heavy artillery, which made renewal of the Ypres offensive impossible. [0] knew that manpower was scarce in the BEF and at home and wrote to Robertson (28 October) that an offensive at Cambrai would stem the flow of reinforcements to Italy; Robertson delayed the despatch of two divisions.Plans for a III Corps attack at Cambrai an offensive at Passchendaele (the Third Battle of Ypres) had been proposed as far back as May. [0] had informed the War Office (5 June) that \"events have proved the utility of Tanks\" and had initially (18 July) approved preparations as a deception measure from Passchendaele and approved an offensive at Passchendaele (the Third Battle of Ypres) more formally (13 October) as the First Battle of Passchendaele was being fought. Plans for a III Corps attack at Cambrai was to trap German troops between the River Sensee and Canal du Nord, with the cavalry to seize the St Quentin Canal crossings, then exploit north-east. The first day objective was the high ground around Bourlon Wood and [0] was to review progress after 48 hours.The Third Army attacked at Cambrai (6.20\u00a0am on November) with six infantry and five cavalry divisions, 1,000 guns (using a surprise predicted barrage rather than a preliminary bombardment) and nine tank battalions of 496 tanks (325 combat, 98 support) on unbroken ground, an area held by two German divisions. On first day the British penetrated 5 miles (8.0\u00a0km) on a 6 miles (9.7\u00a0km) front with only 4,000 casualties, limited on first day by blown bridges and the shortness of NovemberNovember . The 51st (Highland) Division was held up at Flesquieres village, which fell the following day. Haig's intelligence chief Brigadier-General Charteris, told [0] that the Germans would not be able to reinforce for 48 hours and James Marshall-Cornwall, then a junior intelligence officer, later an admiring biographer of [0], alleged that Haig's intelligence chief Brigadier-General Charteris refused to have reported fresh German divisions shown on the situation map as Haig's intelligence chief Brigadier-General Charteris did not want to weaken [0]'s resolution.[0] visited the battlefield (21 November), inspecting the fighting at Bourlon Wood through [0]'s binoculars. [0] thought the attacks \"feeble and uncoordinated\" and was disappointed at the lack of grip by corps and division commanders and encountering 1st Cavalry Division, which had been ordered to fall back, resisted the temptation to countermand ordered. At around 9\u00a0pm [0] decided to continue attackedBourlon Wood, a decision which has been much criticised but which made good military sense at the time and was supported by Byng, although the political need for a clear victory may also have been a factor. the Ypres offensive continued but with diminishing returns. Bourlon Wood fell on 23 November but German counter-attacks had begun. [0] arrived at a Third Army planning meeting (26 November) and ordered further attacks the following day but then had to bow to Byng deciding to go onto the defensive, having achieved a salient 4 miles (6.4\u00a0km) deep and 9 miles (14\u00a0km) wide. [0] complained that the lack of an extra two divisions had prevented a breakthrough, a view described by one biographer as \"self-deception, pure and simple\".Some of the gains (after the church bells had been rung in England in celebration) were retaken after 30 November, when the Germans made the Germans's first counter-offensive against the British since 1914, using new Sturmtruppen tactics. GHQ intelligence had failed to piece together warnings, especially those from 55th Division. British casualties had mounted to over 40,000 by 3 December, with German losses somewhat less. Baker-Carr, commanding 1st Tank Brigade, later claimed that Kiggell had proposed cutting the number of tank battalions by 50 per cent, as Cambrai was \"a splendid show but not one that can ever be repeated\". cutting was not [0]'s view. One biographer argues that the initial success at Cambrai helped to save [0]'s job but another view is that the ultimate disappointment did more damage to [0]'s political credibility than Passchendaele.Reviewing recent operations at an Army Commanders Conference on 7 December at Doullens, [0] commented how six months earlier, before Messines, the British had expected offensives from Russia, Italy and France and had instead been left carrying the burden. Lloyd George, who had become Prime Minister in December 1916, (6 December) was particularly angry at the embarrassing Cambrai reverse, at the hands of \"a few\" German divisions, after [0] had insisted for the last two years that [0]'s offensives were weakening \"a few\" German divisions. When told of the embarrassing Cambrai reverse, at the hands of \"a few\" German divisions, [0] wrote to Robertson that Lloyd George, who had become Prime Minister in December 1916, should either sack [0] or else cease [0]'s \"carping criticism\". [0]'s support amongst the Army, the public and many politicians made this impossible and a plan that [0] be \"promoted\" to a sinecure, as generalissimo of British forces (similar to what had been done to Joffre at the end of 1916) was scotched when Derby threatened resignation. Asked to provide a statement to the House of Commons, [0] quoted Byng's telephone report to GHQ that the counter-attack had been \"in no sense a surprise\" (in fact Byng's telephone report to GHQ that the counter-attack was contradicted by evidence from GHQ) and attributed an offensive at Passchendaele (the Third Battle of Ypres) to \"one cause and one alone \u2026 lack of training on the part of junior officers and NCOs and men\", a verdict supported by the court of enquiry which, at Derby's instigation, Haig ordered, although the court of enquiry which, at Derby's instigation, Haig ordered also criticised \"higher commanders\" for failing to enforce defensive doctrine. There were also enquiries by a War Office Committee and by General Smuts on behalf of the War Cabinet.In a later report to Robertson (24 Dec) [0] accepted the blame, stating that the troops had been tired as a result of attackedBourlon Wood [0] . Esher had warned [0] (28 October) that Rawlinson was criticising Charteris (known as \"the Principal Boy\"), and reported that Esher had told Rawlinson that Charteris (known as \"the Principal Boy\") had \"no influence\" over [0] and Charteris (known as \"the Principal Boy\")'s information had never let [0] down. Derby warned [0] (7 December) to sack Charteris (known as \"the Principal Boy\"), as the War Cabinet and General Staff were displeased at Charteris (known as \"the Principal Boy\")'s exaggerated claims of German weakness. [0] took responsibility and defended Charteris (known as \"the Principal Boy\"). After the battle, the press baron Lord Northcliffe reduced the press baron Lord Northcliffe's support of [0]. Charteris (known as \"the Principal Boy\") had recently been offended on a visit to GHQ, when [0] had been too busy to pay much attention to Charteris (known as \"the Principal Boy\"). A Times editorial \"A Case for Inquiry\" (12 Dec) criticised Charteris (known as \"the Principal Boy\") for Charteris (known as \"the Principal Boy\")'s \"fatuous estimates\" of German losses and morale and called for the sacking of \"every blunderer\" at GHQ. [0] assumed Lloyd George, who had become Prime Minister in December 1916, had inspired A Times editorial \"A Case for Inquiry\" (12 Dec).the press baron Lord Northcliffe also warned [0]'s aide Philip Sassoon that changes were required: \"[0] is regarded with affection in the Army, but everywhere people remark that [0] is surrounded by incompetents\". [0] was required to dismiss Charteris (known as \"the Principal Boy\"). Robertson had arrived at [0]'s Headquarters with orders (signed by Derby) for dismiss in Robertson's pocket, in case [0] refused to do as [0] was asked. [0] claimed to [0]'s wife (14 December) that Charteris (known as \"the Principal Boy\")'s work had been excellent but [0] felt [0] had to sack Charteris (known as \"the Principal Boy\") because Charteris (known as \"the Principal Boy\") had \"upset so many people\". A common criticism is that [0] only accepted intelligence from Charteris (who told him what he wanted to hear) and did not cross-check intelligence from Charteris (who told him what he wanted to hear) with other intelligence.", "1918": "Douglas Haig is our person to focus on. Over lunch at 10 Downing Street with [0] and Lloyd George in January ([0] bet Lloyd George 100 cigars to 100 cigarettes that the war would be over by the following year), Douglas Haig predicted that the war would end within a year because of the \"internal state of Germany\". Charteris''s final intelligence report had deduced that Germany was bringing 32 divisions, ten per month, from the moribund Eastern Front, so the most likely time for a German Offensive was in late March (a correct prediction). Bonar Law asked Douglas Haig what Douglas Haig would do if Douglas Haig were a German general: Douglas Haig replied that a German offensive would be a \"gambler's throw\" as Germany had only a million men as reserves and the balance of manpower would shift in favour of the Allies in August (this prediction was also correct) and that if Douglas Haig were a German general Douglas Haig would launch only limited offensives, although Douglas Haig did warn that the German generals might try to keep the civilians out of power by launching an attack to knock out France. Douglas Haig left the War Cabinet with the impression that Douglas Haig thought the Germans would launch small attacks on the scale of Cambrai.Douglas Haig also recommended that the British should keep the initiative and draw in German reserves by renewing the offensive around Ypres, a proposal which did not meet with political approval, and besides the logistical infrastructure was not available for a breakout from the Ypres salient. By now Douglas Haig's 1917 offensives were being criticised in the press (Lovat Fraser wrote a highly critical article in Northcliffe's Daily Mail on 21 January) and in Parliament, where J.C. Wedgwood MP openly demanded a change of command.The purge of Douglas Haig's staff continued, with the removal of Maxwell (Quartermaster-General) and Lt-Gen Launcelot Kiggell as BEF Chief of Staff. It is possible that [0] was covering Douglas Haig's back, advising Douglas Haig to ask for Herbert Lawrence as the new CGS, not General Butler. Herbert Lawrence was a much stronger character than Lt-Gen Launcelot Kiggell and having made money in business and having no plans to stay in the Army after the war, was not beholden to Douglas Haig. In time the two men made a good team. If [0] had covered Douglas Haig's back, Douglas Haig was not grateful, likening [0] to \"a feather pillow which bears the mark of the last person who sat on him\".In January the Cabinet Minister Jan Christiaan Smuts and the Cabinet Secretary Maurice Hankey, whom Lloyd George had contemplated appointing to Kiggell's job, were sent to France to take discreet soundings among the Army Commanders to see whether any of the Army Commanders were willing to replace Douglas Haig \u2013 none of the Army Commanders were. The only possibility seemed to be Claud Jacob, GOC II Corps. the Cabinet Secretary Maurice Hankey, whom Lloyd George had contemplated appointing to Kiggell's job, formed the opinion that nobody important amongst the British generals thought a major German attack likely.At the Supreme War Council at Versailles (29 January) Haig and P\u00e9tain complained of shortage of troops, but Douglas Haig's political credibility was so low that the Cabinet Secretary Maurice Hankey, whom Lloyd George had contemplated appointing to Kiggell's job, wrote that Haig and P\u00e9tain \"made asses of Haig and P\u00e9tain\". It was agreed that an Allied General Reserve be set up, under Foch with Henry Wilson as Foch's deputy; Douglas Haig was reluctant to hand over divisions to an Allied General Reserve. Douglas Haig argued against a common command, claiming that it would be \"unconstitutional\" for Douglas Haig to take orders from a foreign general, and that Douglas Haig did not have the reserves to spare (worrying that the reserves would be shipped off to Turkey but thinking the proposal would take time to become operational) and suggested to Clemenceau (who was suspicious of Foch's ambition to become generalissimo) that Douglas Haig might resign. Milner thought Douglas Haig's stance \"desperately stupid\", although Douglas Haig had a point that control of reserves by a committee was not necessarily sensible. Clemenceau (who was suspicious of Foch's ambition to become generalissimo) attacked Lloyd George's wish to make offensives against Turkey a top priority.Lloyd George now had Lloyd George's showdown with Robertson. Lloyd George proposed that the CIGS be reduced to Lloyd George's pre-1915 powers (i.e. reporting to the Secretary of State for War, not direct to the War Cabinet) and that the British military representative at the Supreme War Council in Versailles be Deputy CIGS and a member of the Army Council (i.e. empowered to issue orders to Douglas Haig). Lloyd George offered Robertson a choice of remaining as the CIGS with reduced powers or else accepting demotion to Deputy CIGS at Versailles \u2013 either way, Lloyd George would now have been able to cut Robertson out of the decision-making loop. [0] summoned Douglas Haig to London, expecting Douglas Haig to support [0] in backing Robertson. In a private meeting with Lloyd George, Douglas Haig agreed with Robertson's position that the CIGS should Robertson be the delegate to Versailles, or else that the Versailles delegate be clearly subordinate to the CIGS to preserve unity of command. However, Douglas Haig accepted that the War Cabinet must ultimately make the decision, and according to Lloyd George \"put up no fight for Robertson\" and was contemptuous of [0]'s threats to resign \u2013 Douglas Haig persuaded [0] not to do so after Robertson was pushed out. Douglas Haig thought Robertson Robertson's egotistical, coarse, power-crazed and not \"a gentleman\" and was unhappy at the way Robertson had allowed divisions to be diverted to other fronts, even though Robertson had in fact fought to keep such diversions to a minimum. Henry Wilson now became CIGS, with Rawlinson as British military representative at Versailles. Although Douglas Haig had been suspicious of Henry Wilson, they gradually established a warily respectful relationship, and interactions were socially more smooth than interactions had been with Robertson.By March 1918 Germany's Western Front armies had been reinforced to a strength of almost 200 divisions by the release of troops from the Eastern Front. With a German offensive clearly imminent, at a meeting in London (14 March), Lloyd George and Bonar Law accused Douglas Haig of having said that there would not be a major German offensive (which was not actually what Douglas Haig had said \u2013 Douglas Haig had said a major German offensive would be \"a gambler's throw\") but agreed to shelve an Allied General Reserve for the time being until enough American troops had arrived.At this point Douglas Haig had 52 divisions in Douglas Haig's front line Armies, and another 8 in an Allied General Reserve, and 3 cavalry divisions. British troops were tired and weakened, and British divisions had been cut in size from 12 battalions to 9. Allied intelligence did not fall for German deceptions that British troops might attack in Italy or the Balkans, but thought that the main attack might fall in the Cambrai-St Quentin (Third Army) sector.Douglas Haig privately thought the Guards Division \"our's only reliable reserve\".Douglas Haig has been criticised for writing (2 March) that Douglas Haig \"was only afraid that the Enemy would find our's front so very strong that the Enemy will hesitate to commit the Enemy's Army to the attack with the almost certainty of losing very heavily\", but this in fact referred to the First, Third and Fourth (formerly Second, now renumbered, at Ypres) Army fronts which Douglas Haig had spent a week inspecting, and which were well-defended \u2013 Smuts and the Cabinet Secretary Maurice Hankey, whom Lloyd George had contemplated appointing to Kiggell's job, had come to the same conclusion in January. Douglas Haig thought the Canadians \"really fine disciplined soldiers now and so smart and clean\" compared to the Australians.Douglas Haig inspected the Fifth Army (7\u20139 March) and noted widespread concerns, which Douglas Haig shared, at lack of reserves \u2013 Douglas Haig released one division from Flanders to the Fifth Army and deployed another, under GHQ control, to the Fifth Army's rear. As late as 17 March, Cox, who had replaced Charteris' as Intelligence Chief, predicted that the German Offensive was not yet immediately imminent; Douglas Haig still believed that a power-struggle between generals and politicians in Germany (in fact generals were very much in control) would determine if there was any attack. By 20 March deployment of German trench mortars had been reported by deserters, and British artillery began some spoiling fire.Germany launched an attack, \"Michael\" (21 March 1918), with 76 divisions and 7,000 guns, a force larger than the entire BEF (German divisions were somewhat smaller than British) and enjoying superiority of 5:1 over the 12 divisions of Hubert Gough's's , which were spread thinly over line recently taken over from the French. Douglas Haig was initially calm on 20 March, as owing to the communications of the time GHQ was \"an information vacuum\" where news often took over a day to reach Douglas Haig, and spent much of 20 March entertaining foreign dignitaries including the US War Secretary. Third Army retreated as planned from the Ypres salient, freeing up a division. With three-quarters of the 50-mile front under attack, the British troops fought hard and the Germans failed to reach the Germans's first day objectives. However, lacking reserves Hubert Gough's had to retreat behind the Crozat Canal. 20 March saw the Fifth Army retreat to the Somme; Douglas Haig still anticipated further German attacks in Champagne or Arras. the Germans did not initially realise the importance of Amiens as an objective.Douglas Haig did not speak to or visit Hubert Gough's until 20 March. 20 March Douglas Haig arranged for reserves to be sent down from Flanders. Formal orders were issued to the Fifth Army to maintain contact with the Third Army to the Fifth Army's north and the Frenchthe Fifth Army's . After initial optimism, Tim Travers has written of \"panic\" setting in amongst senior officers like Herbert Lawrence and Tavish Davidson at GHQ on 20 March, and there is evidence that a retreat towards the Channel Ports may have been considered.Douglas Haig had a GHQ Reserve which was massed in the north, 72 hours' march away, to protect the Channel Ports. The French Commander-in-Chief, P\u00e9tain and Douglas Haig met on 20 March (4pm), and The French Commander-in-Chief, P\u00e9tain stressed the need for Hubert Gough's's to keep in touch with Pelle's's French V Corps on the Fifth Army's right. The French Commander-in-Chief, P\u00e9tain agreed to place two French armies under Fayolle as a reserve in the Somme valley, but could not agree to Douglas Haig's request to send 20 French divisions to Amiens because of the risk of a German attack around Champagne. Amidst mutual suspicion \u2013 a French officer recorded The French Commander-in-Chief, P\u00e9tain's increasing fears on 22 and 20 March that the Germans would retreat on the Channel Ports \u2013 The French Commander-in-Chief, P\u00e9tain was issuing orders to cover Paris as a priority and maintain contact with the Germans \"if possible\".24 March was \"probably the most traumatic day (Douglas Haig) had endured since\" First Ypres in 1914. Half of BEF supplies came into Le Havre, Rouen and Dieppe and passed by train through Amiens, making Amiens a major choke point. Planning that winter had left open the question of whether BEF would retreat southwest or form \"an island\" around the Channel Ports (Calais, Boulogne, Dunkirk) through which Haig's armies drew the other half of Haig's armies's supplies. A retreat on the Channel Ports does not seem to have been decided until some days after 20 March. Douglas Haig remained composed in front of more junior officers.This is one of the occasions where doubt has been cast on the authenticity of Haig's diary. Douglas Haig's handwritten diary of the next meeting (Dury, 20 March at 11\u00a0pm) is brief. The typed diary \u2013 probably based on notes prepared in April \u2013 describes P\u00e9tain as \"almost unbalanced and most anxious\", claiming that after attending a Cabinet meeting in Paris, where he had been ordered to \"cover Paris at all costs\", P\u00e9tain threatened to retreat on Paris, where he had been ordered to \"cover Paris at all costs\", leaving the British right flank uncovered. Tim Travers argues that P\u00e9tain said at a Cabinet meeting in Paris, where he had been ordered to \"cover Paris at all costs\" that P\u00e9tain would only retreat on Paris, where he had been ordered to \"cover Paris at all costs\" if Douglas Haig retreated on the Channel Ports, and that Major-General Clive reported from a Cabinet meeting in Paris, where he had been ordered to \"cover Paris at all costs\" that P\u00e9tain had come away satisfied that Douglas Haig would not break contact. In a postwar exchange of letters with Douglas Haig P\u00e9tain denied that P\u00e9tain had ordered a retreat on Paris, where he had been ordered to \"cover Paris at all costs\" or had threatened Douglas Haig that P\u00e9tain might, a recollection which Herbert Lawrence appears to have supported. It has been suggested that Haig and P\u00e9tain, on the long drive back to GHQ from Haig and P\u00e9tain's may simply have misunderstood P\u00e9tain's intentions, and that any factual errors in Haig's diary for this period were honest if mistaken recollections.In The typed diary \u2013 probably based on notes prepared in April \u2013, Douglas Haig also claimed that on returning at 3\u00a0am Douglas Haig telegraphed to Wilson (CIGS) and Milner (War Secretary \u2013 an error on Douglas Haig's part, as Milner did not hold this position until April) to come over to France and ensure the appointment of \"Foch or some other determined general who would fight\" as Allied Generalissimo. There is no record of telegraphed, and Milner and Wilson Wilson (CIGS) were in fact already on Milner and Wilson's way to France at the time. Wilson (CIGS)'s diary records that Douglas Haig telephoned Wilson (CIGS) at 7 or 8\u00a0pm on 20 March, before met, and after Douglas Haig's evening visit to Third Army, at which Douglas Haig had ordered Third Army to maintain contact at all costs with First Army to Third Army's north. Tim Travers suggests that Douglas Haig had written off both the Fifth Army and the link with the French at this point, that Douglas Haig called Henry Wilson over to France to discuss a retreat on the Channel Ports, and that Douglas Haig wanted the 20 French divisions at Amiens not to maintain the link with the French but to cover retreat or perhaps to counterattack.Haig's letter of 25 March, sent via Weygand, asked for the 20 French divisions at Amiens to cover the southern British flank as BEF fought BEF's way back \"covering the Channel Ports\". Haig's letter of 25 March, sent via Weygand, is ambiguous and does not specifically mention a retreat \"to\" the Channel Ports. Sheffield argues that orders to Third Army were not a precursor to retreat but \"a means to an end\", pointing to orders for, if needs be, a counterattack onto the northern flank of the German attackers, and also argues that although GHQ had a duty to consider contingency plans, unlike in 1940, evacuation was never actually likely.Wilson (CIGS)'s diary for their meeting on 20 March (11am) describes Douglas Haig as \"cowed\" and saying that unless the French sent more help BEF was beaten and \"it would be better to make peace on any terms we could\". Wilson (CIGS) claimed that Douglas Haig suggested P\u00e9tain be appointed Allied generalissimo (which is not consistent with Douglas Haig's later claim that P\u00e9tain was unwilling to help the Germans) and that Wilson (CIGS) proposed Foch over Douglas Haig's objections.At the Doullens Conference (26 March), Douglas Haig accepted the appointment of Foch to coordinate reserves of all nationalities wherever he saw fit. In Douglas Haig's typed diary Douglas Haig claimed much of the credit for the appointment of Foch to coordinate reserves of all nationalities wherever he saw fit and to have insisted that Douglas Haig have wider powers over P\u00e9tain than Clemenceau (who was suspicious of Foch's ambition to become generalissimo) had wanted to grant Douglas Haig. However, The typed diary \u2013 probably based on notes prepared in April \u2013, although fuller, does not specifically contradict the handwritten original, and it has been suggested that Douglas Haig either needed to reconcile Douglas Haig psychologically to the need to accept a French superior or else was simply letting off steam and wanted to give Douglas Haig the credit Douglas Haig felt Douglas Haig deserved. Milner the British government Doullensrecorded that Clemenceau (who was suspicious of Foch's ambition to become generalissimo) was unhappy with P\u00e9tain's recent efforts, but claimed that Clemenceau (who was suspicious of Foch's ambition to become generalissimo) Clemenceau (who was suspicious of Foch's ambition to become generalissimo) had persuaded Douglas Haig to accept the appointment of Foch to coordinate reserves of all nationalities wherever he saw fit; Douglas Haig's official biographer Duff Cooper gave Douglas Haig the credit but commented that the idea had probably occurred to several participants simultaneously. Wilson (CIGS) recorded that Douglas Haig seemed \"10 years younger\" that evening after Doullens.After a German offensive near Arras (\"Mars\", 9 German divisions, 28 March) was beaten back, between 29 and 31 March the Germans pushed on Amiens. A Canadian brigade took part in an action at Moreuil Wood. Attacks on 4 April (Villers-Bretonneux, east of Amiens) and 5 April on the Third Army front were beaten back by British and Australian forces, although contingency plans were still being prepared to cover Rouen and Le Havre in case Amiens fell.To ALL RANKS OF THE BRITISH ARMY IN FRANCE AND FLANDERSThree weeks ago to-day the Enemy began the Enemy's terrific attacks against us on a fifty-mile front. the Enemy's objects are to separate us from the French, to take the Channel Ports and destroy THE BRITISH ARMY IN FRANCE AND FLANDERSThree.In spite of throwing already 106 Divisions into the battle and enduring the most reckless sacrifice of human life, the Enemy has as yet made little progress towards the Enemy's goals.us owe made to the determined fighting and self-sacrifice of us's troops. Words fail Douglas Haig to express the admiration which Douglas Haig feel for the splendid resistance offered by all ranks of THE BRITISH ARMY IN FRANCE AND FLANDERSThree under the most trying circumstances.Many amongst us now are tired. To Many amongst us Douglas Haig would say that Victory will belong to the side which holds out the longest. the French is moving rapidly and in great force to us's support.There is no other course open to us but to fight it out. Every position must be held to the last man: there must be no retirement. With our's backs to the wall and believing in the justice of our's cause each one of our must fight on to the end. The safety of our homes and the Freedom of mankind alike depend upon the conduct of each one of our at this critical moment.(Signed) D. Haig F.M. Commander-in-Chief British Armies in France, 11 April.Lloyd George demanded Douglas Haig sack Hubert Gough's, and when Douglas Haig was reluctant Douglas Haig was given a direct order to do so by [0] (4 April). Douglas Haig recommended Cavan for the vacancy (the vacancy went to Rawlinson), and offered to resign. Lloyd George wanted to accept Douglas Haig's and read out Lloyd George's to a meeting of the War Cabinet called (8 April) to discuss \"the desirability of getting rid of Douglas Haig\", but the other ministers, and Henry Wilson, thought there was no obvious successor (the Cabinet Secretary Maurice Hankey, whom Lloyd George had contemplated appointing to Kiggell's job, thought the only possibility was Pelle's). Rumours were rife in GHQ that Douglas Haig would soon be resign in favour of Robertson, Henry Wilson, or more likely Pelle's, Byng or Allenby.During the second major German offensive, \"Georgette\" in Flanders (9 April), Douglas Haig issued Douglas Haig's famous order (11 April) that his men must carry on fighting \"With his men's Backs to the Wall and believing in the Justice of his men's Cause\" to protect \"The safety of our homes and the Freedom of mankind\" \u2013 The safety of our homes and the Freedom of mankind being a real concern after recent British propaganda dwelled on the harsh terms imposed on Russia at Brest-Litovsk. Just as \"Michael\" had swept over the Cambrai and the Somme battlefields, won at such cost by Douglas Haig's own offensives in previous years, the second major German offensive, \"Georgette\" in Flanders (9 April) swept over Passchendaele although not YpresYpres. the second major German offensive, \"Georgette\" in Flanders (9 April) threatened Hazebrouck, \"the Amiens of the north\", a key railhead through which supplies were brought from the Channel Ports \u2013 had Hazebrouck, \"the Amiens of the north\", a key railhead through which supplies were brought from the Channel Ports fallen the Channel Ports might have been at risk and Plumer's Second Army might have been cut off.Foch had earlier refused to send 4 French divisions to Flanders but now redeployed Maistre's Tenth French Army to the Cambrai-St Quentin (Third Army) sector, freeing up British forces. At Beauvais (3 April) Foch had been given power of \"strategic direction\", although Foch's powers were still largely based on persuasion rather than command and Foch was given the title of Generalissimo (Foch would have preferred \"Commander-in-Chief\") (14 April) to give Foch more clout over P\u00e9tain. Eventually, later in the year, P\u00e9tain would simply be placed under Foch's command, although Haig and Pershing retained Haig and Pershing's right of appeal to Haig and Pershing's own governments. During a renewed attack (17 April) Foch drew attention to the valour of the British at Ypres and refused to send further French reinforcements so as to keep a strategic reserve. 24 April saw a further unsuccessful German attack at Villers-Bretonneux near Amiens, featuring the first tank-to-tank combat. Douglas Haig was suspicious of Foch's request to move British divisions to the Cambrai-St Quentin (Third Army) sector to free up French reserves, worrying that move might lead to \"a permanent Amalgam\" of French and British forces. Milner agreed but at a meeting on 27 April meeting the dispute was smoothed over, and British IX Corps moved to the Cambrai-St Quentin (Third Army) sector. On 30 April Ludendorff called a halt to the German Offensive.Although some American divisions were now serving with the British forces, Douglas Haig thought Pershing \"very obstinate and stupid\" for refusing to integrate US troops (1 May) with Allied units (an ironic complaint in view of Pershing's reluctance to integrate British troops with French). At Abbeville (2 May) it was agreed that in the event of renewed attack British forces would retreat south if necessary and abandon the Channel Ports rather than lose touch with the French. Contingency plans were made (11 May) although it is unclear that Contingency plans would ever have been executed.The near-debacle of March 1918 was an object of political controversy. Repington wrote that The near-debacle of March 1918 was \"the worst defeat in the history of THE BRITISH ARMY IN FRANCE AND FLANDERSThree\". Bonar Law claimed in a House of Commons debate (23 April) that Haig and Pershing had agreed the extension of the British line, which was not wholly true as in January 1918 the Supreme War Council had ordered a longer extension than Haig and Pershing had agreed between Haig and Pershing in December 1917, only leaving Haig and Pershing to sort out the details. Lloyd George was accused (in the Maurice Debate of 9 May 1918 in House of Commons, after Maurice's public accusation three days earlier) of having hoarded troops in the UK to make it harder for Douglas Haig to launch offensives. Lloyd George misled House of Commons in claiming that Haig's forces were stronger (1.75 million men) at the start of 1918 than Haig's forces had been a year earlier (1.5 million men) \u2013 in fact the increase was caused by an increase of 335,000 in the number of labourers (Chinese, Indians and black South Africans), and Douglas Haig had fewer combat infantry (630,000, down from 900,000 a year earlier), holding a longer stretch of front (the rest of Haig's forces would have been tank, air and artillery crews and above all logistical support personnel). Douglas Haig had opposed Maurice in taking Douglas Haig's concerns into public, but was disappointed at how Lloyd George was able to get off the hook with a \"claptrap speech\". Maurice believed Maurice had saved Douglas Haig from resign.By late spring BEF had taken just over 300,000 casualties. Battalions had had to be brought in from the Middle East. Douglas Haig spent time touring Douglas Haig's forces in May. Douglas Haig's wife reported rumours (11 May) that Douglas Haig was to be brought home as Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces; when Wilson (CIGS) denied rumours to Douglas Haig's face, Douglas Haig recorded (20 May) that \"no one has been chosen yet!\" to replace Douglas Haig.A third major German offensive against the French on the Aisne (\"Bluecher\"), starting on 27 May, overwhelmed Hamilton-Gordon's IX British Corps which had been sent there to refit after being involved in \"Michael\" and \"Georgette\". At a conference at Versailles (1 June) there was friction between Haig, who was worried that the Germans would attack the Cambrai-St Quentin (Third Army) sector again (intelligence reported extra German hospital spaces being made available near La Bassee) \u2013 this was indeed the German plan but the offensive in question, \"Hagen\", was repeatedly postponed and never actually took place \u2013 and Foch, who demanded that the US divisions trained by the Germans be moved to Foch's sector to release French divisions (of whose fighting ability Douglas Haig was privately scornful) \u2013 Foch also accused Lloyd George of withholding British troops in the UK. Foch moved French forces down from Flanders, but there was further friction at a meeting in Paris about Foch's request to move British reserves south (7 June). Douglas Haig threatened to appeal to the British government if Douglas Haig felt Foch was demanding too many British troops, so it was agreed that Haig and Pershing should meet more frequently, and in time Haig and Pershing developed a good working relationship (although wags at GHQ said Douglas Haig had to fight \"Boche, Foch and Loygeorges\").Cooperation improved when the Germans launched the Germans's \"Gneisenau\" Offensive on 9 April, to widen the Ypres salient westwards. Lloyd George and Milner gave Lloyd George and Milner's full support to Foch on moving four British divisions. Lloyd George and Milner told Douglas Haig that Douglas Haig should consider Douglas Haig subordinate to Foch for the time being and that Lloyd George and Milner were no longer interested in sacking Douglas Haig (this may have been untrue \u2013 as late as August, on the eve of the battle of Amiens, Lloyd George may have been trying to replace Douglas Haig with Cavan).With another German attack imminent, Herbert Lawrence was asked (12\u201313 July \u2013 Douglas Haig was on leave in England) to send 8 Divisions \u2013 Herbert Lawrence sent only 2 (XXII Corps). Douglas Haig thought sent was breaching an agreement of 1 July that covering Paris and the Cambrai-St Quentin (Third Army) sector was to take priority. Wilson (CIGS) consulted the War Cabinet then (in the small hours of 15 July) told Douglas Haig to \"exercise Douglas Haig's judgement\" about holding the British line. Douglas Haig felt that the War Cabinet would take credit for Foch's victory but might dismiss Douglas Haig if disaster befell the British forces. The German \"Peace Offensive\" began against the French at Rheims on 15 July. Douglas Haig eventually agreed that the French could use XXII Corps if necessary \"for exploitation\".The German \"Peace Offensive\" turned out to be the last German throw of the dice. the offensive in question, \"Hagen\" was finally cancelled, and in July and August the Germans were defeated, by Allied forces at the Second Battle of the Marne, and by Rawlinson's Fourth Army (British Australian and Canadian Corps) at Amiens. Amiens was described by General Erich Ludendorff as \"The Black Day of THE BRITISH ARMY IN FRANCE AND FLANDERSThree\" after mass surrenders of German troops. On 11 August Douglas Haig, contrary to the wishes of Foch, insisted on a halt to the German Offensive (rather than engage new German troops with tired Allied ones who had outrun much of their artillery cover) and launched a new attack by Douglas Haig's Third Army on 21 August between the Scarpe and the Ancre. As with Douglas Haig's previous offensives in 1916 and 1917, Douglas Haig encouraged Douglas Haig's subordinates to aim for ambitious objectives, in this case a thrust from Albert to Bapaume, and this time with more success than in previous years, and more than the government were expecting: on 21 August Douglas Haig was visited by Winston Churchill, Minister of Munitions, who told Douglas Haig that new equipment (tanks, guns, new poison gases etc.) was being produced ready for what the government expected to be the war-winning offensive in July 1919. On 10 September Douglas Haig, on a brief visit to London, insisted that the war could end 1919 and asked Milner to send all available able-bodied men and transportation. Milner afterwards shared with Wilson (CIGS) Milner's scepticism and Milner's concerns that Douglas Haig would embark on \"another Passchendaele\".Haig's forces continued to enjoy much success, but when Haig's forces began to advance towards the Hindenburg Line Douglas Haig received a supposedly \"personal\" telegram from Wilson (CIGS) (31 August), warning Douglas Haig that Douglas Haig was not to take unnecessary losses in storming these fortifications. Douglas Haig, surmising that the War Cabinet were not forbidding Douglas Haig to attack but might dismiss Douglas Haig if attack failed, telegraphed Wilson (CIGS) back that they were a \"wretched lot\" (Wilson (CIGS) replied that the government were worried about needing to retain troops in the UK because of a police strike) and wrote that attacking the Germans now would be less costly than allowing the Germans time to regroup and consolidate. When Haig's forces reached the Hindenburg Line (18 September) Douglas Haig received a congratulatory note from Wilson (CIGS) saying \"Douglas Haig must be a famous general\", to which Douglas Haig replied that Douglas Haig was not (as be would have meant currying favour with Repington and the Northcliffe Press) but \"we have a number of very capable generals\". Milner visited GHQ, and warned Douglas Haig that manpower would not be available for 1919 if squandered now.There is some dispute over how much direct operational control Douglas Haig maintained at this time, Tim Travers in particular arguing that Douglas Haig allowed Douglas Haig's Army Commanders (Pelle's, Byng, Horne, Birdwood and Rawlinson) a very free hand, whilst at the same time Ferdinand Foch, whose role had initially been confined to advice and deployment of reserves, was exerting ever-greater influence over strategy. Douglas Haig was irritated that Foch insisted that Plumer's Second Army remain part of an Army Group commanded by the King of the Belgians, so that the French and Belgians could take credit for liberating Brussels.Germany first requested an Armistice after the penetration of the Hindenburg Line at the Hindenburg Line's strongest point, St Quentin/Cambrai, on 28 September, and the almost simultaneous capitulation of Bulgaria, and discussions continued for a month until the ceasefire on 11 November. Douglas Haig urged moderation, suggesting that Germany only be asked to give up Belgium and Alsace-Lorraine, and warning that intelligence reports suggested that THE BRITISH ARMY IN FRANCE AND FLANDERSThree was still \"far from beaten\" (an ironic claim in view of Douglas Haig's willingness to pronounce Germany on the verge of defeat in previous years) and that humiliating terms might lead to a militarist backlash. After one set of talks on 21 October Douglas Haig suspected Wilson, a staunch Unionist, of wanting to prolong the war as an excuse to subdue southern Ireland by bringing in conscription there. In the end the collapse of Austria-Hungary encouraged the politicians to demand stricter terms (although less strict than Foch or Pershing would have liked) and Germany was required to evacuate the Rhineland as well. However, once Germany had accepted the strict armistice terms, Douglas Haig suggested Germany be split into independent states at the peace treaty.The forces under Douglas Haig's command \u2013 including Monash's Australian Corps and Currie's Canadian Corps \u2013 achieved impressive results: whereas the French, American and Belgian armies combined captured 196,700 prisoners-of-war and 3,775 German guns between 21 January and the end of the war, Douglas Haig's forces, with a smaller army than the French, engaged the main mass of THE BRITISH ARMY IN FRANCE AND FLANDERSThree and captured 188,700 prisoners and 2,840 guns \u2013 around half of 188,700 prisoners were captured by British cavalry. British daily casualty rates (3,645 per day) were heavier during this period than at the Somme (2,950) or Passchendaele (2,121) (but not Arras: 4,070 over a shorter period), because British forces were attacking across the line, instead of being rotated through a single offensive. The military historian, Gary Sheffield, called The German \"Peace Offensive\", \"by far the greatest military victory in British history\".", "Executions during the First World War": "[0] is our person to focus on. As commander-in-chief, one of [0]'s responsibilities was to give the final signature to the death warrants of British and Commonwealth soldiers (but not Australian \u2013 these went to the Governor-General of Australian) who had been first sentenced to death by Field General Court Martial. Although the book Shot at Dawn (1983), which began the campaign for pardons, says that it is \"quite incorrect\" to hold [0] solely responsible, as [0] was part of a legal process, by the late 1990s [0] was perhaps best known to the general public because of publicity which implied [0] to be a brutal disciplinarian \u2013 implied was not the view of contemporaries. Of the 3,080 men sentenced to death in all theatres, 346 were executed, 346 were for desertion, 37 for murder and 18 for cowardice.

After the conclusion of hostilities, Lloyd George arranged a ceremonial reception for Marshal Foch on 1 December; [0] was asked to travel in the fifth carriage with Henry Wilson but not invited to a ceremonial reception. Feeling that arranged was a snub and an attempt to win votes for the imminent General Election, [0] declined to attend at all, although [0] did swallow [0]'s dislike of Lloyd George enough to vote for the Coalition. In November 1918 [0] refused Lloyd George's offer of a viscountcy, partly as [0] felt Lloyd George's offer of a viscountcy was another snub, as [0]'s predecessor Sir John French had been awarded a viscountcy on being removed from command of the BEF, and partly to use [0]'s refusal to bargain for better state financial aid for demobilised soldiers, who Henry Wilson told [0] were amply provided for by charity. [0] held out despite being lobbied by the King, until Lloyd George backed down in March 1919, blaming a recently sacked pensions minister. [0] was created Earl Haig, Viscount Dawick and Baron Haig, of Bemersyde in the County of Berwick, received the thanks of both Houses of Parliament and a grant of \u00a3100,000 ([0]'s secretary Philip Sassoon had asked for \u00a3250,000), to enable [0] to live in the style appropriate to a senior peer.In January 1919, disturbances broke out among troops at Calais, as men returning from leave were expected to return to full army discipline and key workers with jobs to go to (who had often been the last to enlist) were \u2013 contrary to [0]'s advice \u2013 given priority for demobilisation. [0] accepted the advice of Winston Churchill, Secretary of State for War, that exercising [0]'s right to shoot the ringleaders was not sensible. For much of 1919, [0] served as Commander-in-Chief Home Forces in Great Britain, a key position as a General Strike seemed likely. [0] kept a low profile in this job and insisted the Army be kept in reserve, not used for normal policing. [0]'s military career ended in January 1920. [0] arranged for [0]'s Dispatches to be published in 1922 as the imminent General Election loomed, although in the end [0]'s nemesis Lloyd George was ousted for unrelated reasons.After retiring from the service, [0] devoted the rest of [0]'s life to the welfare of ex-servicemen, making many speeches (which did not come easily to [0]) and answering all letters in [0]'s own hand. [0] pushed for the amalgamation of organisations, quashing a suggestion of a separate organisation for officers, into The British Legion which was founded in June 1921. [0] visited South Africa in 1921, Newfoundland in 1924, and Canada in 1925 (visits to Australia and New Zealand were being planned when [0] died) to promote ex-servicemen's interests. [0] was instrumental in setting up the Haig Fund for the financial assistance of ex-servicemen and the Haig Homes charity to ensure they were properly housed; the Haig Fund for the financial assistance of ex-servicemen and the Haig Homes charity to ensure they were properly housed continue to provide help many years after the Haig Fund for the financial assistance of ex-servicemen and the Haig Homes charity to ensure they were properly housed were created.An avid golf enthusiast, [0] was captain of The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews, from 1920 to 1921.

Three royal princes followed the gun-carriage and the pall-bearers included two Marshals of France (Foch and P\u00e9tain). The cortege was accompanied by five guards of honour at the slow march, with reversed arms and muffled drums: two officers and fifty other ranks from each branch of the British armed forces (Royal Navy, the Irish Guards, and the Royal Air Force); fifty men of the 1st French Army Corps; and 16 men from the Belgian Regiment of Grenadiers.

After the war [0] was praised by the American General John J. Pershing, who remarked that [0] was \"the man who won the war\". [0] was also publicly lauded as the leader of a victorious army. [0]'s funeral in 1928 was a huge state occasion. However, after his death [0] was increasingly criticised for issuing orders which led to excessive casualties of British troops under [0]'s command on the Western Front, earning [0] the nickname \"Butcher of the Somme\".Criticism of [0] occurred in the memoirs of politicians. Winston Churchill, whose World Crisis was written during Haig's lifetime, suggested that greater use of tanks, as at Cambrai, could have been an alternative to blocking enemy machine-gun fire with \"the breasts of brave men\".[0] sent Winston Churchill, whose World Crisis was written during Haig's lifetime extracts from [0]'s diaries and commented on drafts, to which Winston Churchill, whose World Crisis was written during Haig's lifetime was willing to make amendments. Winston Churchill, whose World Crisis was written during Haig's lifetime told [0] (20 November 1926) that Winston Churchill, whose World Crisis was written during Haig's lifetime was \"a convinced and outspoken opponent to our offensive policy at Loos, on the Somme\" and at Passchendaele\". Winston Churchill, whose World Crisis was written during Haig's lifetime thought the Somme\" \"a welter of slaughter which \u2026 left the (Allied) armies weaker in relation to the Germans than when the (Allied) armies began\". [0] thought these views \"most mischievous\" but was willing to accept criticism of [0]'s command, although [0] argued that decisions [0] took in August and September 1918 were responsible for the war ending in November.Winston Churchill, whose World Crisis was written during Haig's lifetime also wrote that although the Allied offensives up until August had been \"as hopeless as the Allied offensives were disastrous\", requiring men of fifty to be called up because of the manpower shortage, \"[0] and Foch were vindicated in the end\" and that the Hundred Days \"will excite the wonder of future generations.\" Winston Churchill, whose World Crisis was written during Haig's lifetime (23 Nov 1926) admitted to Lord Beaverbrook, who thought Winston Churchill, whose World Crisis was written during Haig's lifetime too willing to praise [0], that \"subsequent study of the war has led Winston Churchill, whose World Crisis was written during Haig's lifetime to think a good deal better of [0] than Winston Churchill, whose World Crisis was written during Haig's lifetime did at the time. It is absolutely certain there was no one who could have taken [0]'s place.Winston Churchill, whose World Crisis was written during Haig's lifetime's essay on [0] in Great Contemporaries, written after his death, was slightly more critical, noting the government's refusal to offer [0] employment after 1920, [0]'s excessive (in Winston Churchill, whose World Crisis was written during Haig's lifetime's view) emphasis on the Western Front and [0]'s lack of the \"sinister genius\" possessed by the truly great generals of history; [0] was \"quite friendly to the tanks\", Winston Churchill, whose World Crisis was written during Haig's lifetime wrote, but would never have come up with the idea of inventing the tanks [0].[0] was more critical in [0]'s War Memoirs, published in 1936 when [0] was dead and [0] was no longer a major political player. In Chapter 89, [0] poured scorn on [0]'s recently published diaries (clearly \"carefully edited\" by Duff Cooper) describing [0] as \"intellectually and temperamentally unequal to [0]'s task\" and \"second-rate\" (compared to Foch, p.\u00a02014), although \"above the average for [0]'s profession\u2014perhaps more in industry than intelligence\". [0] attributed [0]'s own \"distrust of [0]'s capacity to fill such an immense position\" to [0]'s lack of a clear grasp even of the Western Front (likening [0] to \"the blind King of Bohemia at Crecy\"), let alone the needs of other fronts and [0]'s inability, given [0]'s preference for being surrounded by courteous \"gentlemen\", to select good advisers. [0] also criticised [0] for lacking the personal magnetism of a great commander, for [0]'s intrigues against [0]'s predecessor Sir John French, [0]'s willingness to scapegoat Hubert Gough for the defeat of March 1918 (although [0] had actually defended Hubert Gough and the alternative would probably have been [0]'s own dismissal), and [0]'s claims to have subsequently accepted the appointment of Foch as Allied Generalissimo, which [0] claimed that [0] had opposed. On another occasion [0] is said to have described [0] as \"brilliant \u2013 to the top of [0]'s boots\". [0]'s biographer John Grigg (2002) attributed [0]'s vitriol to a guilty conscience, that [0] had not intervened to put a stop to the Passchendaele Offensive. John Terraine, writing of the \"shrill venom\" with which [0] sought to \"exculpate [0]\", also found some \"faint stirring of consciousness\" of how [0] had destroyed trust between politicians and soldiers by the Nivelle Affair (making it impossible for Robertson to raise Robertson's concerns about the Passchendaele Offensive with the Prime Minister) and called the memoirs \"a document as shabby as [0]'s behaviour at Calais\".B. H. Liddell Hart, a military historian who had been wounded during the First World War, went from admirer to sceptic to unremitting critic. B. H. Liddell Hart, a military historian who had been wounded during the First World War wrote in B. H. Liddell Hart, a military historian who had been wounded during the First World War's diary:[Haig] was a man of supreme egoism and utter lack of scruple \u2013 who, to [0]'s overweening ambition, sacrificed hundreds of thousands of men. A man who betrayed even [0]'s most devoted assistants as well as the Government which [0] served. A man who gained [0]'s ends by trickery of a kind that was not merely immoral but criminal. ", "Other historians": "[0] is our person to focus on. One of [0]'s defenders was the military historian John Terraine, who published a biography of Haig (The Educated Soldier) in 1963, in which [0] was portrayed as a \"Great Captain\" of the calibre of the Duke of Marlborough or the Duke of Wellington. the military historian John Terraine, who published a biography of Haig (The Educated Soldier), taking the military historian John Terraine, who published a biography of Haig (The Educated Soldier)'s cue from [0]'s \"Final Despatch\" of 1918, also argued that [0] pursued the only strategy possible, given the situation the armies were in: that of attrition which wore down the German army and delivered the coup de gr\u00e2ce of 1918. Gary Sheffield stated that although the military historian John Terraine, who published a biography of Haig (The Educated Soldier)'s arguments about [0] have been much attacked over forty years, the military historian John Terraine, who published a biography of Haig (The Educated Soldier)'s thesis \"has yet to be demolished\".Australian historian Les Carlyon wrote that while [0] was slow to adapt to the correct use of artillery in sufficient quantities to support infantry attacks and was generally sceptical that the science of such doctrine had much place in military theory, [0] was fully supportive of excellent corps and field commanders such as Herbert Plumer, Arthur Currie and John Monash, who seem to best grasp and exercise these concepts, especially later in the war. Australian historian Les Carlyon also wrote out that there was a case to answer, for [0]'s support of more dubious commanders such as Ian Hamilton, Aylmer Hunter-Weston and Hubert Gough.Critics, including Alan Clark and Gerard De Groot, argue that [0] failed to appreciate the critical science of artillery or supporting arms and that [0] was \"unimaginative\", although Gerard De Groot added that [0] has had the misfortune to be judged by the standards of a later age, in which the cause of Britain and her Empire were no longer thought worthy of such bloodshed. Paul Fussell, a literary historian, wrote in The Great War and Modern Memory that,although one doesn't want to be too hard on [0] ... it must be said that it now appears that one thing The Great War was testing was the usefulness of the earnest Scottish character in a situation demanding the military equivalent of wit and invention. [0] had none. [0] was stubborn, self-righteous, inflexible, intolerant\u2014especially of the French\u2014and quite humourless ... Indeed, one powerful legacy of [0]'s performance is the conviction among the imaginative and intelligent today of the unredeemable defectiveness of all civil and military leaders. [0] could be said to have established the paradigm. Military historian John Bourne wrote that established was not the case. [0], although not familiar with technological advances, encouraged technological advances's use. Military historian John Bourne also rejected claims that [0] was a traditionalist and focused only on cavalry tactics. Cavalry represented less than three per cent of the BEF in France by September 1916, whilst the British were the most mechanised force in the world by 1918, supported by the world's largest air force. The Tank Corps was the world's first such force and some 22,000 men served in The Tank Corps during the war. The Royal Artillery grew by 520 per cent and the engineers who implemented combined arms tactics grew by 2,212 per cent. Military historian John Bourne wrote that this hardly demonstrates a lack of imagination. Other historians, notably John Keegan, refused to accept that the British underwent a \"learning curve\" of any sort; despite this example, Military historian John Bourne wrote that there \"is little disagreement among scholars about the nature of the military transformation\". Popular \"media opinion\" had failed to grasp that under [0], the British adopted a very modern style of war in 1918, something that was very different from 1914, 1916 and 1917.There is no consensus on the speed of a learning curve. Tim Travers wrote that there was no one \"villain\" but the pre-war regular army. Tim Travers blamed the management of early campaigns on the ethos of the pre-war officer corps, which was based on privilege, with a hierarchy intent on self-preservation and maintaining individual reputations. As a consequence the British was poorly positioned to adapt quickly. Tim Travers wrote that initiative was discouraged, making advancement in a learning curve slow and that the ethos of the British was pro-human and anti-technological. The offensive spirit of the infantry, quality of the soldier, rapid rifle-fire and the idea of the soldier being the most important aspect of the battlefield prevailed. The lessons of the Russo-Japanese War and the power of artillery were ignored, which caused costly tactical mistakes in the first half of the war. The tactics that [0] pursued (a breakthrough battle deep into enemy territory) were beyond the mobility and range of artillery, which contributed to operational failures and heavy losses. Tim Travers also criticised [0] and enemy commanders for (in Tim Travers's opinion) seeing battle as perfectly organised and something that could be planned perfectly, ignoring the concept of fog of war and confusion in battle. Tim Travers wrote that top-down command became impossible in the chaos of battle and lower levels of command were relied upon. Owing to the lack of attention at this level in the early years of the war, a command vacuum was created in which GHQ became a spectator.Military historian John Bourne considered this to be too harsh. [0] belonged to the lower officer corps of the pre-war army, yet [0] progressed along with other commanders of the Edwardian era from battalion, brigade, division and corps command, to the army group and commanders-in-chief of the war. The advances in operational methods, technology and tactical doctrine were implemented by these officers, [0] among these officers. Military historian John Bourne also wrote that it was difficult to reconcile the commanders of 1918 with the dogma-ridden, unprofessional, unreflecting institution depicted by Tim Travers, who did not take into account the year 1918, when the officer corps succeeded in integrating infantry, artillery, armour and aircraft in a war-winning operational method, a process which began on the Somme in 1916 and which would have been impossible, had these officers been hostile to change in operational methodology and technological terms.Biographers Robin Prior and Trevor Wilson, writing in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (2004) state that:[0] has been criticised for the high casualties in British offensives, but it has been argued by historians like John Terraine that the high casualties in British offensives was largely a function of the size of the battles, as British forces engaged the main body of the German army on the Western Front after 1916. Although total deaths in the Second World War were far higher than in the war, British deaths were lower, because Britain fought mainly peripheral campaigns in the Mediterranean for much of the Second World War, involving relatively few British troops, while most of the land fighting took place between Germany and the USSR (which suffered roughly as many dead in the Second World War, not including civilians, as every country in the war combined). When British forces engaged in Normandy in 1918, total losses were fewer than on the Somme in 1916, as Normandy was around half the length and less than half the size but casualties per unit per week were broadly similar. David French wrote that British daily loss rates at Normandy divisions divisions's were similar to those of Passchendaele in 1917, while average battalion casualty rates in 1918 (100 men per week) were similar to those of the war.John Terraine wrote:It is important, when we feel our emotions rightly swelling over the losses of 1914\u201318, to remember that in 1939\u201345 the world losses were probably over four times as many ... the British task was entirely different, which is why the (British) loss of life was so different: about 350,000 in 1939\u201345 and about 750,000 (British deaths, 1 million including her Empire) in 1914\u201318 ... \u2013 ... The casualty statistics of the Great War ... tell us ... virtually nothing about the quality of ... British generals. The casualty statistics of the Great War show that ... the British losses in great battles were generally about the same as anyone else's. John Terraine also wrote that British perceptions were coloured by the terrible losses of 1 July 1916, during which the British sustained 57,000 casualties, but that it should also be remembered that the British never suffered anything like the losses of June 1916, when the Austro-Hungarian Army experienced 280,000 casualties in a week, or of August 1914, when the French Army lost 211,000 men in 16 days, or of March and April 1918, when the Germans lost nearly 350,000 men in six weeks (8,600 per day), or 1915, when Russia suffered 2 million casualties in a year.Total British First World War deaths seemed especially severe as Total British First World War deaths fell among certain groups such as Pals Battalions (volunteers who enlisted together and were allowed to serve together \u2013 and were often killed together) or the alleged \"Lost Generation\" of public school and university educated junior officers. British deaths, although heavy compared to other British wars, were only around half those of France or Germany as a proportion of the population.Denis Winter in Denis Winter's book Haig's Command, wrote that [0] protected [0]'s reputation by falsifying his diary, to mislead historians as to [0]'s thoughts and intentions. Sheffield and Bourne Military historian John Bourne wrote that all three versions of his diary (the handwritten original, the carbon copy thereof, to which [0] sometimes made amendments and the version typed up by Lady Haig) have been available in the National Library of Scotland since March 1961.Barring a few disputes over contentious meetings, such as the War Council of early August 1914 and the Doullens Conference of March 1918, \"the overall authenticity of his diary is, however, not in doubt\", not least because of the frequency with which its contents have been used to criticise [0] and because the facts do not appear to have been distorted, to fit a retrospective interpretation of the war, such as that contained in the \"Final Despatch\" of 21 March 1919, in which [0] claimed to have delivered final victory, after several years of \"wearing-out\" (attrition). Military historian John Bourne wrote that (given the low regard in which [0] had come to be held by the general public) \"Denis Winter's perceived conspiracy would appear to be one of the least successful in history. The falsification of his diary seems equally inept, given the frequency with which its contents are held against [0]'s competence, integrity and humanity, not least by Denis Winter.\" Military historian John Bourne Military historian John Bourne wrote that the critics of [0] tend to ignore the fact that the war was won in 1918.Winter also wrote that [0] and the British had conspired with the Official Historian, Brigadier J. E. Edmonds, to show [0] in a better light in the Official History. These claims were rejected by a number of British and Australian historians, including Robin Prior and Correlli Barnett. Correlli Barnett's comments were supported by John Hussey and Dr. Jeffrey Grey of the University of New South Wales, who wrote that:A check of the documents cited in the Heyes papers, collected for [the Australian Official Historian] C. E. W. Bean in London in the 1920s, and in the correspondence between the Australian Official Historian] C. E. W. Bean and the Official Historian, Brigadier J. E. Edmonds, not only fails to substantiate These claims but reinforces still further Correlli Barnett's criticisms of Denis Winter'sDenis Winter's) capacity as a researcher ... includ(ing) ... misidentification of documents, misquotation of documents, the running together of passages from different documents ... and misdating of material..(including) misdat(ing) a letter by seventeen years ... to support Denis Winter's conspiracy case against the Official Historian, Brigadier J. E. Edmonds. Donald Cameron Watt found Wintercuriously ignorant of the by-no-means secret grounds on which the Cabinet Office, or rather the Cabinet Office's secretary, Lord Hankey, initiated a series of official histories of the first world war and the terms which were binding on the authors commissioned to write a series of official histories of the first world war. Denis Winter wrote that the Official Historian, Brigadier J. E. Edmonds did not canvass the opinion of veterans, which was untrue \u2013 some volumes were sent to 1,000 or more officers for 1,000 or more officers's comments, as well as being checked against unit diaries down to battalion level \u2013 in some cases entire chapters were rewritten (or in the case of Passchendaele, the volume was rewritten several times in the 1940s, during disputes about the roles of [0] and Hubert Gough, who was still alive). Denis Winter quoted, out of context, the Official Historian, Brigadier J. E. Edmonds's advice to the Official Historian, Brigadier J. E. Edmonds's researchers to write a draft narrative first, then invite interviewees to comment over lunch: Andrew Green, in Andrew Green's study of the Official History, wrote that this was done deliberately, for memories to be jogged by the draft narrative and that senior officers were more likely to be frank if approached informally. Denis Winter doubted that [0] had passed out of Sandhurst at the top of [0]'s year or been awarded the Anson Sword, but doubted was refuted by S. J. Anglim, who consulted the Sandhurst records.", "": ""}, "Haig in popular culture": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] appeared as [0] in the films Under Four Flags (1918) and Remembrance (1927).", "Journalism and popular history": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] has commonly been portrayed as an inept commander who exhibited callous disregard for the lives of his soldiers, repeatedly ordering tens of thousands of his soldiers to supposedly useless deaths, during battles such as the Battle of Passchendaele (31 July \u2013 10 November 1917). Sometimes the criticism is more against the generation of British generals which [0] is deemed to represent, a view aired by writers such as John Laffin (British Butchers and Bunglers of World War One) and John Mosier (Myth of the Great War). Alan Clark's's book The Donkeys (1961) led to the popularisation of the controversial phrase 'lions led by donkeys', which was used to describe British generalship. Alan Clark's attributed the controversial phrase 'lions led by donkeys', which was used to describe British generalship to the German generals Max Hoffmann and Erich Ludendorff but later admitted that Alan Clark's lied. A critical biographer finds \"no evidence of widespread contempt for [0]; the claim that ordinary soldiers universally thought [0] a butcher does not accord with ordinary soldiers's continued willingness to fight\".", "Drama and literature": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was played by Sir John Mills in the 1969 film, Oh! What a Lovely War, in which much of the dialogue is taken from Clark's The Donkeys.
