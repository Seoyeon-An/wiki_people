His parents were Rodger Oscar Webb, a manager for a catering contractor that serviced the Indian Railways, and the former Dorothy Marie Dazely. His parents also spent some years in Howrah, West Bengal. After the violence of Direct Action Day, His parents decided to relocate to Britain permanently.

When [0] was 16, Rodger Oscar Webb, a manager for a catering contractor that serviced the Indian Railways bought [0] a guitar, and in 1957, [0] formed the school vocal harmony group The Quintones, before singing in the Dick Teague Skiffle Group.", "1958\u20131963: Success and stardom": "Cliff Richard is our person to focus on. [0] became lead singer of a rock and roll group, the Drifters (distinct from the US group of the same name). The 1950s entrepreneur Harry Greatorex wanted [0] to change [0]'s name. The name Cliff was adopted as The name Cliff sounded like \"cliff face\", which suggested \"Rock\". It was \"Move It\" writer Ian Samwell who suggested the surname \"Richard\" as a tribute to [0]'s musical hero Little Richard.Before a rock and roll group, the Drifters (distinct from the US group of the same name)'s first large-scale appearance, at the Regal Ballroom in Ripley, Derbyshire in 1958, a rock and roll group, the Drifters (distinct from the US group of the same name) adopted the name \"Cliff Richard and the Drifters\". The four members were [0], \"Move It\" writer Ian Samwell, Terry Smart on drums and Norman Mitham on guitar. None of the other three played with the later and better known Shadows, although \"Move It\" writer Ian Samwell wrote songs for Cliff Richard's later career.  Agent George Ganjou saw a rock and roll group, the Drifters (distinct from the US group of the same name) perform in London, and recommended a rock and roll group, the Drifters (distinct from the US group of the same name) to Norrie Paramor for an audition.For Richard's debut session, Norrie Paramor provided Cliff Richard with \"Schoolboy Crush\", a song previously recorded by American Bobby Helms. Cliff Richard was permitted to record one of his own songs for the B-side; one of his own songs was \"Move It\", written and composed by a rock and roll group, the Drifters (distinct from the US group of the same name)'s while \"Move It\" writer Ian Samwell was on board a number 715 Green Line bus on the way to Cliff Richard's house for a rehearsal. For Richard's debut session, Norrie Paramor used the session guitarist Ernie Shears on lead guitar and Frank Clark on bass.There are various stories about why the A-side was replaced by the B-side. One is that Norrie Paramor's young daughter raved about the B-side; another was that influential TV producer Jack Good, who used a rock and roll group, the Drifters (distinct from the US group of the same name) for his TV show Oh Boy!, wanted the only song on his TV show to be the B-side as opposed to \"Schoolboy Crush\", a song previously recorded by American Bobby Helms. Cliff Richard was quoted as saying:It's wonderful to be going on TV for the first time, but Cliff Richard feel so nervous that Cliff Richard don't know what to do. Cliff Richard shaved Cliff Richard's sideburns off last night... Jack Good said shaved would make Cliff Richard look more original. the B-side went to No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart. John Lennon credited the B-side as being the first British rock record.In the early days, Cliff Richard was marketed as the British equivalent of Elvis. Like previous British rockers such as Tommy Steele and Marty Wilde, Cliff Richard adopted Elvis-like dress and hairstyle. In performance Cliff Richard struck a pose of rock attitude, rarely smiling or looking at the audience or camera. Cliff Richard's late 1958 and early 1959 follow-up singles, \"High Class Baby\" and \"Livin' Lovin' Doll\", were followed by \"Mean Streak\", which carried a rocker's sense of speed and passion, and Lionel Bart's \"Living Doll\".It was on Lionel Bart's \"Living Doll\" that a rock and roll group, the Drifters (distinct from the US group of the same name) began to back Cliff Richard on record. Lionel Bart's \"Living Doll\" was Cliff Richard's fifth record and became Cliff Richard's first No. 1 single. By that time, a rock and roll group, the Drifters (distinct from the US group of the same name)'s line-up had changed with the arrival of Jet Harris, Tony Meehan, Hank Marvin and Bruce Welch. a rock and roll group, the Drifters (distinct from the US group of the same name) was obliged to change a rock and roll group, the Drifters (distinct from the US group of the same name)'s name to \"The Shadows\" after legal complications with the American group the Drifters as Lionel Bart's \"Living Doll\" entered the American top 40, licensed by ABC-Paramount. Lionel Bart's \"Living Doll\" was used in Cliff Richard's d\u00e9but film Serious Charge, but Lionel Bart's \"Living Doll\" was arranged as a country standard, rather than a rock and roll standard.a rock and roll group, the Drifters (distinct from the US group of the same name) were not a typical backing group. a rock and roll group, the Drifters (distinct from the US group of the same name) became contractually separate from Cliff Richard, and a rock and roll group, the Drifters (distinct from the US group of the same name) received no royalties for records backing Cliff Richard. In 1959, a rock and roll group, the Drifters (distinct from the US group of the same name) landed an EMI recording contract of a rock and roll group, the Drifters (distinct from the US group of the same name)'s own, for independent recordings. 1959, a rock and roll group, the Drifters (distinct from the US group of the same name) released three singles, two of which featured double-sided vocals and one of which had instrumental A and B sides. a rock and roll group, the Drifters (distinct from the US group of the same name) thereafter had several major hits, including five UK No. 1s. a rock and roll group, the Drifters (distinct from the US group of the same name) also continued to appear and record with Cliff Richard and wrote many of Cliff Richard's hits. On more than one occasion, a a rock and roll group, the Drifters (distinct from the US group of the same name) instrumental replaced a Cliff Richard song at the top of the British charts.Lionel Bart's \"Living Doll\" triggered a softer, more relaxed, sound. Subsequent hits, the No. 1s \"Travellin' Light\" and \"I Love You\" and also \"A Voice in the Wilderness\", lifted from Cliff Richard's film Expresso Bongo, and \"Theme for a Dream\" cemented Cliff Richard's status as a mainstream pop entertainer along with contemporaries such as Adam Faith and Billy Fury. Throughout the early 1960s, Cliff Richard's hits were consistently in the top five.In 1961, EMI organised Richard's 21st birthday party at EMI's London headquarters in Manchester Square led by Norrie Paramor. Photographs of Richard's 21st birthday party were incorporated into Cliff Richard's next album \"21 Today\" in which Tony Meehan joined in despite, then, having very recently left a rock and roll group, the Drifters (distinct from the US group of the same name) to be replaced by Brian Bennett.Typically, a rock and roll group, the Drifters (distinct from the US group of the same name) closed the first half of the show with a 30-minute set of a rock and roll group, the Drifters (distinct from the US group of the same name)'s own, then backed Cliff Richard on Cliff Richard's show-closing 45-minute stint as exemplified by the retrospective CD album release of Live at the ABC Kingston 1962. Tony Meehan and Jet Harris left a rock and roll group, the Drifters (distinct from the US group of the same name) in 1961 and 1962 respectively and later had Tony Meehan and Jet Harris's own chart successes for Decca. a rock and roll group, the Drifters (distinct from the US group of the same name) added bass players Brian Locking (1962\u201363) and then John Rostill (1963\u201368) and took on Brian Bennett permanently on drums.In the early years, particularly on album and EP releases, Cliff Richard also recorded ballads backed by the Norrie Paramor Orchestra with Tony Meehan (and later Brian Bennett) as a session drummer. Cliff Richard's first such single without a rock and roll group, the Drifters (distinct from the US group of the same name) was When the Girl in Your Arms Is the Girl in Your Heart in 1961, and Cliff Richard continued to release one or two per year, including covers of \"It's All in the Game\" in 1963 and \"Constantly\" in 1964, a revival of a popular Italian hit. In 1965, sessions under the direction of Billy Sherrill in Nashville, Tennessee were particularly successful, yielding \"The Minute You're Gone\", which topped the UK Singles Chart and \"Wind Me Up (Let Me Go)\" which made No. Cliff Richard, and a rock and roll group, the Drifters (distinct from the US group of the same name) in particular, however, never achieved star status in the United States. In 1960 a rock and roll group, the Drifters (distinct from the US group of the same name) toured the United States and were well-received, but lacklustre support and distribution from a revolving door of American record labels proved an obstacle to long-term success there despite several chart records by Cliff Richard including the aforementioned \"It's All in the Game\" on Epic, via a renewed linking of the worldwide Columbia labels after Philips ended Philips's distribution deal with CBS. To a rock and roll group, the Drifters (distinct from the US group of the same name)'s chagrin, Lionel Bart's \"Living Doll\" reached No. 2 in the United States through a cover version by Danish guitarist Jorgen Ingmann which was almost unchanged from a rock and roll group, the Drifters (distinct from the US group of the same name)'s worldwide hit. Richard and the band a rock and roll group, the Drifters (distinct from the US group of the same name) appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show, which was crucial for the Beatles, but appeared did not help Richard and the band gain sustained success in North America.Richard and the band a rock and roll group, the Drifters (distinct from the US group of the same name) appeared in six feature films including a debut in the 1959 film Serious Charge but most notably in The Young Ones, Summer Holiday, Wonderful Life, and Finders Keepers. The Young Ones, Summer Holiday, Wonderful Life, and Finders Keepers created The Young Ones, Summer Holiday, Wonderful Life, and Finders Keepers's own genre, known as the \"Cliff Richard musical\", and led to Cliff Richard's being named the No. 1 cinema box office attraction in Britain for both 1962 and 1963, beating that of even James Bond. The title song of The Young Ones became Cliff Richard's biggest-selling single in the United States, selling over one million copies in the UK. The irreverent 1980s TV sitcom The Young Ones took The irreverent 1980s TV sitcom The Young Ones's name from The Young Ones. In mid-1963, Richard and the band appeared for a season in Blackpool, where Cliff Richard had Cliff Richard's portrait modelled by Victor Heyfron.", "1964\u20131975: Changing circumstances": "Cliff Richard is our person to focus on. As with the other existing rock acts in Britain, [0]'s career was affected by the advent of the Beatles and the Mersey sound in 1963 and 1964.

Richard's said: \"Richard's's three sisters have children, and it's been wonderful to watch children grow up, get married and start families of children's own. Richard's've made sure Richard's've always played a part in children's lives. So while Richard's think Richard's would have been a good father, Richard's've given Richard's to Richard's's family and Richard's wouldn't have it any other way. Richard's's 'freedom' allows Richard's to continue Richard's's career.
