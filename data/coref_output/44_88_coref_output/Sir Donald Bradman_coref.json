{"summary": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] (27 August 1908 \u2013 25 February 2001), nicknamed \"The Don\", was an Australian international cricketer, widely acknowledged as the greatest  batsman of all time. [0]'s cricketing successes have been claimed by Shane Warne, among others, to make [0] the \"greatest sportsperson\" in history. [0]'s career Test batting average of 99.94 is considered by some to be the greatest achievement by any sportsman in any major sport.Although [0] reportedly disliked fame, [0]'s iconic status made [0] one of Australia's's best-known personalities and arguably Australia's's \"first celebrity\".The story that [0] practised alone with a cricket stump and a golf ball is part of Australian folklore. [0]'s meteoric rise from bush cricket to the Australian Test team took just over two years. Before [0]'s 22nd birthday, [0] had set many records for top scoring, some of which still stand, and became Australia's's sporting idol at the height of the Great Depression. This hero status grew and continued through the Second World War.During a 20-year playing career, [0] consistently scored at a level that made [0], in the words of former Australia's captain Bill Woodfull, \"worth three batsmen to Australia's\". A controversial set of tactics, known as Bodyline, was specially devised by the England team to curb [0]'s scoring. As a captain and administrator, [0] was committed to attacking, entertaining cricket; [0] drew spectators in record numbers. [0] hated the constant adulation, however, and the constant adulation affected how [0] dealt with others. The focus of attention on [0]'s individual performances strained relationships with some teammates, administrators and journalists, who thought [0] aloof and wary. Following an enforced hiatus due to the Second World War, [0] made a dramatic comeback, captaining an Australian team known as \"The Invincibles\" on a record-breaking unbeaten tour of England. A complex and highly driven man, not given to close personal relationships, [0] retained a pre-eminent position in the game by acting as an administrator, selector and writer for three decades following [0]'s retirement. Even after [0] became reclusive in [0]'s declining years, [0]'s opinion was highly sought, and [0]'s status as a national icon was still recognised. Almost fifty years after [0]'s retirement as a Test player, in 1997, Prime Minister John Howard called [0] the \"greatest living Australian\". Bradman's image has appeared on postage stamps and coins, and a museum dedicated to [0]'s life was opened while [0] was still living. On the centenary of [0]'s birth, 27 August 2008, the Royal Australian Mint issued a $5 commemorative gold coin with Bradman's image. In 2009, [0] was inducted posthumously as an inaugural member into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame."}, "Early years": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was the youngest son of George and Emily (n\u00e9e Whatman) Bradman, and was born on 27 August 1908 at Cootamundra, New South Wales (NSW). [0] had a brother, Victor, and three sisters \u2013 Islet, Lilian and Elizabeth May.[0] was of English heritage on both sides of [0]'s family. [0]'s grandfather Charles Andrew Bradman had left Withersfield, Suffolk, for Australia. In 1930, when [0] played at Cambridge during [0]'s first tour of England, [0] took the opportunity to trace [0]'s forebears in the region. [0] was also partly of Italian lineage; one of [0]'s great-grandfathers had been one of the first Italians to migrate to Australia in George and Emily (n\u00e9e Whatman) Bradman lived in the hamlet of Yeo Yeo, near Stockinbingal. Emily (n\u00e9e Whatman) Bradman gave birth to [0] at the Cootamundra, New South Wales (NSW) home of Granny Scholz, a midwife, which is now the Bradman Birthplace Museum. Emily (n\u00e9e Whatman) Bradman had hailed from Mittagong in the NSW Southern Highlands and in 1911, when [0] was about two-and-a-half years old, George and Emily (n\u00e9e Whatman) Bradman decided to relocate to Bowral, close to Emily (n\u00e9e Whatman) Bradman's family and friends in Mittagong in the NSW Southern Highlands, as life at the hamlet of Yeo Yeo, near Stockinbingal was proving difficult. Emily, who bowled left-arm spin, played in the women's intercolonial cricket competition between the main states in 1890s.[0] practised batting incessantly during [0]'s youth. [0] invented [0]'s own solo cricket game, using a cricket stump for a bat and a golf ball. A water tank, mounted on a curved brick stand, stood on a paved area behind the family home. When hit into the curved brick facing of a curved brick stand, the ball rebounded at high speed and varying angles\u2014and [0] would attempt to hit the ball again. This form of practice developed [0]'s timing and reactions to a high degree. In more formal cricket, [0] hit [0]'s first century at the age of 12, with an undefeated 115 playing for Bowral Public School against Mittagong High School.", "Bush cricketer": "[0] is our person to focus on. During the 1920\u201321 season, [0] acted as scorer for the local Bowral team, captained by his uncle George Whatman. In October 1920, [0] filled in when the local Bowral team, captained by his uncle George Whatman was one man short, scoring 37* and 29* on debut. During the 1920\u201321 season, his uncle George Whatman took [0] to the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) to watch the fifth Ashes Test match. On that day, [0] formed an ambition, telling his uncle George Whatman: \"[0] shall never be satisfied until [0] play on the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG).\" [0] left school in 1922 and went to work for a local real estate agent who encouraged [0]'s sporting pursuits by giving [0] time off when necessary. [0] gave up cricket in favour of tennis for two years but resumed playing cricket in 1925\u201326.Bradman became a regular selection for the local Bowral team, captained by his uncle George Whatman; several outstanding performances earned [0] the attention of Sydney newspapers. Competing on matting-over-concrete pitches, Bowral played other rural towns in the Berrima District competition. Against Wingello, a team that included the future Test bowler Bill O'Reilly, [0] made 234. In the competition final against Moss Vale, which extended over five consecutive Saturdays, [0] scored 320 not out.During the following Australian winter (1926), the ageing Australian team lost The Ashes in England, and a number of Test players retired. The New South Wales Cricket Association began a hunt for new talent. Mindful of [0]'s big scores for Bowral, The New South Wales Cricket Association wrote to [0], requesting [0]'s attendance at a practice session in Sydney. [0] was subsequently chosen for the \"Country Week\" tournaments at both cricket and tennis, to be played during separate weeks. [0]'s boss presented [0] with an ultimatum: [0] could have only one week away from work, and therefore had to choose between both cricket and tennis. [0] chose cricket.[0]'s performances during Country Week resulted in an invitation to play grade cricket in Sydney for St George in the 1926\u201327 season. [0] scored 110 on [0]'s debut, making [0]'s first century on a turf pitch. On 1 January 1927, [0] turned out for the NSW second team. For the remainder of 1927, [0] travelled the 130 kilometres (81\u00a0mi) from Bowral to Sydney every Saturday to play for St George.", "First-class debut": "[0] is our person to focus on. The next season continued the rapid rise of [0]. Selected to replace the unfit Archie Jackson in the NSW team, [0] made his first-class debut at the Adelaide Oval, aged 19. [0] secured the achievement of a hundred on his first-class debut, with an innings of 118 featuring what soon became [0]'s trademarks\u2014fast footwork, calm confidence and rapid scoring. In the final match of The next season, [0] made [0]'s first century at the Adelaide Oval, against the Sheffield Shield champions Victoria. Despite [0]'s potential, [0] was not chosen for the Australian second team to tour New Zealand.[0] decided that [0]'s chances for Test selection would be improved by moving to Sydney for the 1928\u201329 season, when England were to tour in defence of the Ashes. Initially, [0] continued working in real estate, but later took a promotions job with the sporting goods retailer Mick Simmons Ltd. In the first match of the 1928\u201329 season, when England were to tour in defence of the Ashes, [0] scored a century in each innings against Queensland. [0] followed scored with scores of 87 and 132 not out against the England touring team, and was rewarded with selection for the first Test, to be played at Brisbane."}, "Test career": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. Playing in only his tenth first-class match, Bradman, nicknamed \"Braddles\" by [0]'s teammates, found only his tenth first-class match a harsh learning experience. Caught on a sticky wicket, Australia were all out for 66 in the second innings and lost by 675\u00a0runs (still a Test record). Following scores of 18 and 1, the selectors dropped [0] to twelfth man for the Second Test. An injury to Bill Ponsford early in the Second Test required [0] to field as substitute while England amassed 636, following England's 863 runs in the First Test. RS \"Dick\" Whitington wrote, \"...\u00a0[0] had scored only nineteen [0] and these experiences appear to have provided [0] with food for thought\". Recalled for the Third Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, [0] scored 79 and 112 to become the youngest player to make a Test century, although the Third Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground was still lost. Another loss followed in the Fourth Test. [0] reached 58 in the second innings and appeared set to guide Australia to victory when [0] was run out. run was to be the only run out of [0]'s Test career. The losing margin was just twelve runs.Australia did manage to win the Fifth and final Test. [0] top-scored with 123 in the first innings and was at the wicket in the second innings when [0]'s captain, Jack Ryder, hit the winning runs. [0] completed the season with 1,690 first-class runs, averaging 93.88, and [0]'s first multiple century in a Sheffield Shield match, not out against Victoria, set a new ground record for the SCG. [0] averaged 113.28 in 1929\u201330. In a trial match to select the team that would tour England, [0] was last man out in the first innings for 124. As the team that would tour England followed on, the skipper Bill Woodfull asked [0] to keep the pads on and open the second innings. By the end of play, [0] was 205 not out, on [0]'s way to 225. Against Queensland at the SCG, [0] set a then world record for first-class cricket by scoring 452 not out; [0] made 452 not out in only 415 minutes. Not long after scoring, [0] recalled:On 434...[0] had a curious intuition...[0] seemed to sense that the ball would be a short-pitched one on the leg-stump, and [0] could almost feel [0] getting ready to make [0]'s shot before the ball was delivered. Sure enough, the ball pitched exactly where [0] had anticipated, and, hooking the ball to the square-leg boundary, [0] established the only record upon which [0] had set [0]'s heart. Although [0] was an obvious selection to tour England, [0]'s unorthodox style raised doubts that [0] could succeed on the slower English pitches. Percy Fender wrote:...[0] will always be in the category of the brilliant, if unsound, ones. Promise there is in [0] in plenty, though watching [0] does not inspire one with any confidence that [0] desires to take the only course which will lead [0] to a fulfilment of Promise. [0] makes a mistake, then makes a mistake again and again; [0] does not correct a mistake, or look as if [0] were trying to do so. [0] seems to live for the exuberance of the moment. The encomiums were not confined to [0]'s batting gifts; nor did the criticism extend to [0]'s character. \"Australia has unearthed [0]\", said former Australian Test great Clem Hill, \"self-taught, with natural ability. But most important of all, with [0]'s heart in the right place.\" Selector Dick Jones weighed in with the observation that it was \"good to watch [0] talking to an old player, listening attentively to everything that is said and then replying with a modest 'thank you'.\"", "1930 tour of England": "Sir Donald Bradman is our person to focus on. England were favourites to win the 1930 Ashes series, and if [0] were to exceed expectations their young batsmen, Bradman and Jackson, needed to prosper. With Jackson's elegant batting technique, Jackson appeared the brighter prospect of their young batsmen, Bradman and Jackson. However, Sir Donald Bradman began the tour with 236 at Worcester and went on to score 1,000\u00a0first-class runs by the end of May, the fifth player (and first Australian) to achieve score. In Sir Donald Bradman's first Test appearance in England, Sir Donald Bradman hit 131 in the second innings but England won the second innings. Sir Donald Bradman's batting reached a new level in the Second Test at Lord's's where Sir Donald Bradman scored 254 as [0] won and levelled the 1930 Ashes series. Later in life, Sir Donald Bradman rated the Second Test at Lord's the best innings of Sir Donald Bradman's career as \"practically without exception every ball went where every ball was intended to go\". Wisden noted Sir Donald Bradman's fast footwork and how Sir Donald Bradman hit the ball \"all round the wicket with power and accuracy\", as well as faultless concentration in keeping the ball on the ground.In terms of runs scored, the Second Test at Lord's was soon surpassed. In the Third Test, at Headingley, Sir Donald Bradman scored a century before lunch on 11 July, the first day of the Test match to equal the performances of Victor Trumper and Charlie Macartney. In the afternoon, Sir Donald Bradman added another century between lunch and tea, before finishing 11 July, the first day of the Test match on 309 not out. Sir Donald Bradman remains the only Test player to pass 300 in one day's play. Sir Donald Bradman's eventual score of 334 was a world-record, exceeding the previous mark of 325 by Andy Sandham. Sir Donald Bradman dominated the Australian innings; the second-highest tally was 77 by Alan Kippax. Businessman Arthur Whitelaw later presented Sir Donald Bradman with a cheque for \u00a31,000 in appreciation of Sir Donald Bradman's achievement. the Third Test, at Headingley ended in anti-climax as poor weather prevented a result, as poor weather also did in the Fourth Test.In the deciding Test at The Oval, England made 405. During an innings stretching over three days due to intermittent rain, Sir Donald Bradman made yet another multiple century, this time 232, which helped give [0] a big lead of 290 runs. In a crucial partnership with Jackson, Sir Donald Bradman battled through a difficult session when England fast bowler Harold Larwood bowled short on a pitch enlivened by the rain. Wisden gave this period of play only a passing mention:On the Wednesday morning the ball flew about a good deal, both batsmen frequently being hit on the body...on more than one occasion each player cocked the ball up dangerously but always, as it happened, just wide of the fieldsmen. A number of English players and commentators noted Sir Donald Bradman's discomfort in playing the short, rising delivery. The revelation came too late for this period of play, but was to have immense significance in the next Ashes series. [0] won this period of play by an innings and regained Ashes. won made an impact in [0]. With the economy sliding toward depression and unemployment rapidly rising, [0] found solace in sporting triumph. The story of a self-taught 22-year-old from the bush who set a series of records against England made Sir Donald Bradman a national hero. The statistics Sir Donald Bradman achieved on the tour, especially in the Test matches, broke records for the day and some have stood the test of time. In all, Sir Donald Bradman scored 974\u00a0runs at an average of 139.14 during the Test series, with four centuries, including two double hundreds and a triple. As of 2022, no-one has matched or exceeded 974 runs or three double centuries in one Test series; the record of 974 runs exceeds the second-best performance by 69 runs and was achieved in two fewer innings. Sir Donald Bradman's first-class tally, 2,960\u00a0runs (at an average of 98.66 with 10\u00a0centuries), was another enduring record: the most by any overseas batsman on a tour of England.On the tour, the dynamic nature of Sir Donald Bradman's batting contrasted sharply with Sir Donald Bradman's quiet, solitary off-field demeanour. Sir Donald Bradman was described as aloof from Sir Donald Bradman's and Sir Donald Bradman did not offer to buy his teammates a round of drinks, let alone share the money given to Sir Donald Bradman by England. Sir Donald Bradman spent a lot of Sir Donald Bradman's free time alone, writing, as Sir Donald Bradman had sold the rights to a book. On Sir Donald Bradman's return to [0], Sir Donald Bradman was surprised by the intensity of Sir Donald Bradman's reception; Sir Donald Bradman became a \"reluctant hero\". Mick Simmons wanted to cash in on Sir Donald Bradman's newly won fame, asking Sir Donald Bradman to leave Sir Donald Bradman's and attend official receptions Mick Simmons organised in Adelaide, Melbourne, Goulburn, Sir Donald Bradman's hometown of Bowral and Sydney, where Sir Donald Bradman received a brand new custom-built Chevrolet. At each stop, Sir Donald Bradman received a level of adulation that \"embarrassed\" Sir Donald Bradman. This focus on individual accomplishment, in a team game, \"...\u00a0permanently damaged relationships with Sir Donald Bradman's contemporaries\".Commenting on [0]'s victory, [0]'s vice-captain Vic Richardson said, \"...[0] could have played any team without Sir Donald Bradman, but [0] could not have played England without Clarrie Grimmett\". Sir Donald Bradman can be heard in a 1930 recording saying, \"Sir Donald Bradman have always endeavoured to do Sir Donald Bradman's best for the side, and the few centuries that have come Sir Donald Bradman's way have been achieved in the hope of winning matches. Sir Donald Bradman's one idea when going into bat was to make runs for [0].\"", "Reluctant hero": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 1930\u201331, against the first West Indian side to visit Australia, [0]'s scoring was more sedate than in England\u2014although [0] did make 223 in 297 minutes in the Third Test at Brisbane and 152 in 154 minutes in the following Test at Melbourne. However, [0] scored quickly in a very successful sequence of innings against South Africa in the Australian summer of 1931\u201332. For NSW against South Africa, [0] made 30, 135 and 219. In the Test matches, [0] scored 226 (277 minutes), 112 (155 minutes), 2 and 167 (183 minutes); [0]'s 299 not out in the Fourth Test, at Adelaide, set a new record for the highest score in a Test in Australia. Australia won nine of the ten Tests played over the two series.At this point, [0] had played fifteen Test matches since the beginning of 1930, scoring 2,227 runs at an average of 131. [0] had played eighteen innings, scoring ten centuries, six of which had extended beyond 200. [0]'s overall scoring rate was 42 runs per hour, with 856 (or 38.5% of [0]'s tally) scored in boundaries. Significantly, [0] had not hit a six, which typified [0]'s attitude: if [0] hit the ball along the ground, then the ball could not be caught. During this phase of [0]'s career, [0]'s youth and natural fitness allowed [0] to adopt a \"machine-like\" approach to batting. The South African fast bowler Sandy Bell described bowling to [0] as, \"heart-breaking\u00a0... with [0]'s sort of cynical grin, which rather reminds one of the Sphinx\u00a0... [0] never seems to perspire\".Between these two seasons, [0] seriously contemplated playing professional cricket in England with the Lancashire League club Accrington, playing[0]'s . A consortium of three Sydney businesses offered an alternative. A consortium of three Sydney businesses devised a two-year contract whereby Bradman wrote for Associated Newspapers, broadcast on Radio 2UE and promoted the menswear retailing chain FJ Palmer and Son. However, a two-year contract whereby Bradman wrote for Associated Newspapers, broadcast on Radio 2UE and promoted the menswear retailing chain FJ Palmer and Son increased [0]'s dependence on [0]'s public profile, making it more difficult to maintain the privacy that [0] ardently desired.In a second-class fixture in November 1931, [0] scored 100 off 22 balls in a three over spell in a match for Blackheath against Lithgow.  [0]'s score of 256 included 14 sixes and 29 fours (notably hitting more sixes in a three over spell than [0] hit in [0]'s entire first class career).Bradman's chaotic wedding to Jessie Menzies in April 1932 epitomised these new and unwelcome intrusions into [0]'s private life. The church \"was under siege all throughout the day... uninvited guests stood on chairs and pews to get a better view\"; police erected barriers that were broken down and many of those invited could not get a seat. Just weeks later, [0] joined a private team organised by Arthur Mailey to tour the United States and Canada. [0] travelled with [0]'s , and the couple treated tour as a honeymoon. Playing 51 games in 75 days, [0] scored 3,779 runs at 102.1, with eighteen centuries. Although the standard of play was not high, the effects of the amount of cricket [0] had played in the three previous years, together with the strains of [0]'s celebrity status, began to show on [0]'s return home.", "Bodyline": "[0] is our person to focus on. \"As long as Australia has [0] Australia will be invincible\u00a0... It is almost time to request a legal limit on the number of runs [0] should be allowed to make.\"News Chronicle, LondonWithin the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), which administered English cricket at the time, few voices were more influential than \"Plum\" Warner's's, who, when considering Australia's response to [0], wrote that Australia \"must evolve a new type of bowler and develop fresh ideas and strange tactics to curb [0]'s almost uncanny skill\". To that end, \"Plum\" Warner's orchestrated the appointment of Douglas Jardine as Australia captain in 1931, as a prelude to Douglas Jardine leading the 1932\u201333 tour to Australia, with \"Plum\" Warner's as team manager. Remembering that [0] had struggled against bouncers during [0]'s 232 at The Oval in 1930, Douglas Jardine decided to combine traditional leg theory with short-pitched bowling to combat [0]. Douglas Jardine settled on the Nottinghamshire fast bowlers Harold Larwood and Bill Voce as the spearheads for his tactics. In support, the Australia selectors chose another three pacemen for the squad. The unusually high number of fast bowlers caused a lot of comment in both countries and roused [0]'s own suspicions.[0] had other problems to deal with at this time; among other problems were bouts of illness from an undiagnosed malaise which had begun during the tour of North America, and that the Australian Board of Control had initially refused permission for [0] to write a column for the Sydney Sun newspaper. [0] a two-year contract with the Sunthreatened to withdraw from cricket to honour a two-year contract with the Sun when the Australian Board of Control denied [0] permission to write; eventually, the Sydney Sun newspaper released [0] from a two-year contract with the Sun, in a victory for the Australian Board of Control. In three first-class games against Australia before the Tests, [0] averaged just 17.16 in six innings. Douglas Jardine decided to give his tactics a trial in only one game, a fixture against an Australian XI at Melbourne. In only one game, a fixture against an Australian XI at Melbourne, [0] faced his tactics and later warned local administrators that trouble was brewing if his tactics continued. [0] withdrew from the First Test at the SCG amid rumours that [0] had suffered a nervous breakdown. Despite [0]'s absence, Australia employed what were already becoming known as his tactics against the Australian batsmen and won an ill-tempered match.The public clamoured for the return of [0] to defeat Bodyline: \"[0] was the batsman who could conquer this cankerous bowling... 'Bradmania', amounting almost to religious fervour, demanded [0]'s return\". Recovered from [0]'s indisposition, [0] returned to the side in Kippax's position. A world record crowd of 63,993 at the MCG saw [0] come to the crease on the first day of the Second Test with the score at 2/67. A standing ovation ensued that delayed play for several minutes. [0] anticipated receiving a bouncer as his first ball and, as the bowler delivered, [0] moved across [0]'s to play the hook shot. his first ball failed to rise and [0] dragged his first ball onto [0]'s ; the first-ball duck was [0]'s first in a Test. A world record crowd of 63,993 at the MCG fell into stunned silence as [0] walked off. However, Australia took a first innings lead in the Second Test, and another record crowd on 2 January 1933 watched [0] hit a counter-attacking second innings century. a counter-attacking second innings century helped set Australia a target of 251 to win. Bill O'Reilly and Bert Ironmonger bowled Australia to a series-levelling victory amid hopes that Bodyline was beaten.The Third Test at the Adelaide Oval proved pivotal. There were angry crowd scenes after the Australian captain Bill Woodfull and wicket-keeper Bert Oldfield were hit by bouncers. An apologetic Warner entered the Australian dressing room and was rebuked by the Australian captain Bill Woodfull. Woodfull's remarks (that \"...there are two teams out there and only one of them is playing cricket\") were leaked to the press, and An apologetic Warner and others attributed Woodfull's remarks (that \"...there are two teams out there and only one of them is playing cricket\") to Australian opening batsman Jack Fingleton; however, for many years (even after Australian opening batsman Jack Fingleton's death) a bitter war of accusation passed between Australian opening batsman Jack Fingleton and [0] as to who was the real source of Woodfull's remarks (that \"...there are two teams out there and only one of them is playing cricket\"). In a cable to the MCC, the Australian Board of Control repeated the allegation of poor sportsmanship directed at An apologetic Warner by the Australian captain Bill Woodfull.With the support of the MCC, Australia continued with Bodyline despite Australian protests. Australia won the last three Tests convincingly and regained the Ashes. [0] caused controversy with [0]'s own tactics. Always seeking to score, and with the leg side packed with fielders, [0] often backed away and hit the ball into the vacant half of the outfield with unorthodox shots reminiscent of tennis or golf. This brought [0] 396 runs (at 56.57) for the series and plaudits for attempting to find a solution to Bodyline, although [0]'s series average was just 57% of [0]'s career mean. Australian opening batsman Jack Fingleton was in no doubt that [0]'s game altered irrevocably as a consequence of Bodyline, writing:Bodyline was specially prepared, nurtured for and expended on [0] and, in consequence, [0]'s technique underwent a change quicker than might have been the case with the passage of time. Bodyline plucked something vibrant from [0]'s art. The constant glare of celebrity and the tribulations of the season forced [0] to reappraise [0]'s life outside the game and to seek a career away from [0]'s cricketing fame. Harry Hodgetts, a South Australian delegate to the Board of Control, offered [0] work as a stockbroker if [0] would relocate to the Adelaide Oval and captain the South Australia team (SA). Unknown to the public, the SA Cricket Association (SACA) instigated Harry Hodgetts, a South Australian delegate to the Board of Control,'s approach and subsidised [0]'s wage. Although [0]'s wife was hesitant about moving, [0] eventually agreed to offered in February 1934.", "Declining health and a brush with death": "[0] is our person to focus on. In [0]'s farewell season for NSW, [0] averaged 132.44, [0]'s best yet. [0] was appointed vice-captain for the 1934 tour of England. However, \"[0] was unwell for much of the [English] summer, and reports in newspapers hinted that [0] was suffering from heart trouble\". Although [0] again started with a double century at Worcester, [0]'s famed concentration soon deserted [0]. Wisden wrote:...there were many occasions on which [0] was out to wild strokes. Indeed at one period [0] created the impression that, to some extent, [0] had lost control of [0] and went in to bat with an almost complete disregard for anything in the shape of a defensive stroke. At one stage, [0] went thirteen first-class innings without a century, the longest such spell of [0]'s career, prompting suggestions that Bodyline had eroded [0]'s confidence and altered [0]'s technique. After three Tests, the 1934 tour of England was locked up 1\u20131, and [0] had scored 133 runs in five innings. The Australians travelled to Sheffield and played a warm-up game before the Fourth Test. [0] started slowly and then, \"...[0] [was] back with The Australians, in the twinkling of an eye, almost\". [0] went on to make 140, with the last 90 runs coming in just 45 minutes. On the opening day of the Fourth Test at Headingley (Leeds), England were out for 200, but The Australians slumped to 3/39, losing the third wicket from the last ball of the opening day of the Fourth Test at Headingley (Leeds). Listed to bat at number five, [0] would start [0]'s innings the next day.That evening, [0] declined an invitation to dinner from Neville Cardus, telling Neville Cardus that [0] wanted an early night because The Australians needed [0] to make a double century the next day. Neville Cardus pointed out that [0]'s previous innings on the ground was 334, and the law of averages was against another such score. [0] told Neville Cardus, \"[0] don't believe in the law of averages\". In the event, [0] batted all of the second day and into the third, putting on a then world record partnership of 388 with Bill Ponsford. When [0] was finally out for 304 (473 balls, 43 fours and two sixes), The Australians had a lead of 350 runs, but rain prevented The Australians from forcing a victory. The effort of the lengthy innings stretched [0]'s reserves of energy, and [0] did not play again until the Fifth Test at The Oval, the match that would decide the Ashes.In the first innings at The Oval, Bradman and Ponsford recorded an even more massive partnership, this time 451 runs. It had taken Bradman and Ponsford less than a month to break the record they had set at Headingley; the record they had set at Headingley was to last 57 years. [0]'s share of an even more massive partnership, this time 451 runs was 244 from 271 balls, and the Australian total of 701 set up victory by 562 runs. For the fourth time in five series, the Ashes changed hands. England would not recover the Ashes again until after [0]'s retirement.Seemingly restored to full health, [0] blazed two centuries in the last two games of the 1934 tour of England. However, when [0] returned to London to prepare for the trip home, [0] experienced severe abdominal pain. It took a doctor more than 24 hours to diagnose acute appendicitis and a surgeon operated immediately. [0] lost a lot of blood during operated and peritonitis set in. Penicillin and sulphonamides were still experimental treatments at this time; peritonitis was usually a fatal condition. On 25 September, the hospital issued a statement that Bradman was struggling for his life and that blood donors were needed urgently.\"The effect of a statement that Bradman was struggling for his life and that blood donors were needed urgently was little short of spectacular\". the hospital could not deal with the number of donors and closed the hospital's switchboard in the face of the avalanche of telephone calls generated by a statement that Bradman was struggling for his life and that blood donors were needed urgently. Journalists were asked by Journalists's editors to prepare obituaries. O'Reilly took a call from King George V's's secretary asking that King George V's be kept informed of the situation. Bradman's wife started the month-long journey to London as soon as Bradman's wife received a statement that Bradman was struggling for his life and that blood donors were needed urgently. En route, Bradman's wife heard a rumour that Bradman's wife's had died. A telephone call clarified the situation and by the time Bradman's wife reached London, [0] had begun a slow recovery. [0] followed medical advice to convalesce, taking several months to return to The Australians and missing the 1934\u201335 Australian season.", "Internal politics and the Test captaincy": "Sir Donald Bradman is our person to focus on. There was off-field intrigue in Australian cricket during the antipodean winter of [0]. Australia, scheduled to make a tour of South Africa at the end of the year, needed to replace the retired Woodfull as captain. The Board of Control wanted Sir Donald Bradman to lead Australia, scheduled to make a tour of South Africa at the end of the year,, yet, on 8 August, The Board of Control announced Sir Donald Bradman's withdrawal from Australia, scheduled to make a tour of South Africa at the end of the year, due to a lack of fitness. Surprisingly, in the light of announced, Sir Donald Bradman led Australia, scheduled to make a tour of South Africa at the end of the year, in a full programme of matches that season.The captaincy was given to Vic Richardson, Bradman's predecessor as South Australian captain. Cricket author Chris Harte's's analysis of the situation is that a prior (unspecified) commercial agreement forced Sir Donald Bradman to remain in Australia. Cricket author Chris Harte's attributed an ulterior motive to Sir Donald Bradman's relocation: the off-field behaviour of Vic Richardson, Bradman's predecessor as South Australian captain and other South Australian players had displeased the SACA, which was looking for new leadership. To help improve discipline, Sir Donald Bradman became a committeeman of the SACA, which was looking for new leadership, and a selector of the South Australian and Australian teams. Sir Donald Bradman took Sir Donald Bradman's to Australia's first Sheffield Shield title for ten years, Sir Donald Bradman weighing in with personal contributions of 233 against Queensland and 357 against Victoria. Sir Donald Bradman finished that season with 369 (in 233\u00a0minutes), a South Australian record, made against Tasmania. The bowler who dismissed Sir Donald Bradman, Reginald Townley, would later become leader of the Tasmanian Liberal Party.Australia defeated South Africa 4\u20130 and senior players such as O'Reilly were pointed in senior players such as O'Reilly's comments about the enjoyment of playing under Vic Richardson, Bradman's predecessor as South Australian captain's captaincy. A group of players who were openly hostile toward Sir Donald Bradman formed during a tour of South Africa. For some, the prospect of playing under Sir Donald Bradman was daunting, as was the knowledge that Sir Donald Bradman would additionally be sitting in judgement of some's abilities in Sir Donald Bradman's role as a selector.To start the new season, the Test side played a \"Rest of Australia\" team, captained by Sir Donald Bradman, at Sydney in early October 1936. the Test side suffered a big defeat, due to Sir Donald Bradman's 212 and a haul of 12 wickets taken by leg-spinner Frank Ward. Sir Donald Bradman let the members of the Test team Australia, scheduled to make a tour of South Africa at the end of the year, know that despite Australia, scheduled to make a tour of South Africa at the end of the year,'s recent success, Australia, scheduled to make a tour of South Africa at the end of the year, still required improvement. Shortly afterwards, Sir Donald Bradman's first child was born on 28 October, but died the next day. Sir Donald Bradman took time out of cricket for two weeks and on Sir Donald Bradman's return made 192 in three hours against Victoria in the last match before the beginning of the Ashes series.The Test selectors made five changes to the members of the Test team. Significantly, Australia's most successful bowler, Clarrie Grimmett, was replaced by Ward, one of four players making their debut. Bradman's role in Grimmett's omission from the team Australia, scheduled to make a tour of South Africa at the end of the year, was controversial and Bradman's role in Grimmett's omission from the team became a theme that dogged Sir Donald Bradman as Australia's most successful bowler, Clarrie Grimmett, continued to be prolific in domestic cricket while Australia's most successful bowler, Clarrie Grimmett,'s successors were ineffective\u2014Sir Donald Bradman was regarded as having finished Australia's most successful bowler, Clarrie Grimmett,'s Test career in a political purge.Australia fell to successive defeats in the opening two Tests, Sir Donald Bradman making two ducks in Sir Donald Bradman's four innings, and it seemed that the captaincy was affecting Sir Donald Bradman's form. The Test selectors made another four changes to Australia, scheduled to make a tour of South Africa at the end of the year, for the Third Test at Melbourne.Sir Donald Bradman won the toss on New Year's Day 1937, but again failed with the bat, scoring just 13. Australia could not take advantage of a pitch that favoured batting, and finished New Year's Day 1937 at 6/181. On the second day, rain dramatically altered the course of the game. With the sun drying a pitch that favoured batting (in those days, covers could not be used during matches) Sir Donald Bradman declared to get England in to bat while a pitch that favoured batting was \"sticky\"; England also declared to get Australia back in, conceding a lead of 124. Sir Donald Bradman countered by reversing Sir Donald Bradman's batting order to protect Sir Donald Bradman's run-makers while conditions improved. reversing worked and Sir Donald Bradman went in at number seven. In an innings spread over three days, Sir Donald Bradman battled influenza while scoring 270 off 375\u00a0balls, sharing a record partnership of 346 with Jack Fingleton, and Australia went on to victory. In 2001, Wisden rated scoring as the best Test match innings of all time.The next Test, at the Adelaide Oval, was fairly even until Sir Donald Bradman played another patient second innings, making 212 from 395 balls. Australia levelled the series when the erratic left-arm spinner \"Chuck\" Fleetwood-Smith bowled Australia to victory. In the series-deciding Fifth Test, Sir Donald Bradman returned to a more aggressive style in top-scoring with 169 (off 191\u00a0balls) in Australia's 604 and Australia won by an innings. Australia's achievement of winning a Test series after outright losses in the first two matches has never been repeated in Test cricket.", "End of an era": "[0] is our person to focus on. During the 1938 tour of England, [0] played the most consistent cricket of [0]'s .[0] needed to score heavily as England had a strengthened batting line-up, while the Australian bowling was over-reliant on O'Reilly. Grimmett was overlooked, but Jack Fingleton made the team, so the clique of anti-[0] players remained. Playing 26\u00a0innings on the 1938 tour of England, [0] recorded 13\u00a0centuries (a new Australian record) and again made 1,000\u00a0first-class runs before the end of May, becoming the only player to do so twice. In scoring 2,429\u00a0runs, [0] achieved the highest average ever recorded in an English season: 115.66.In the First Test, England amassed a big first innings score and looked likely to win, but Stan McCabe made 232 for Australia, a performance [0] rated as the best [0] had ever seen. With Australia forced to follow-on, [0] fought hard to ensure Stan McCabe's effort was not in vain, and [0] secured the draw with 144 not out. 144 not out was the slowest Test hundred of [0]'s and [0] played a similar innings of 102 not out in the next Test as Australia struggled to another draw. Rain completely washed out the Third Test at Old Trafford.Australia's opportunity came at Headingley, a Test described by [0] as the best [0] ever played in. England batted first and made 223. During the Australian innings, [0] backed [0] by opting to bat on in poor light conditions, reasoning that Australia could score more runs in bad light on a good pitch than on a rain affected pitch in good light, when [0] had the option to go off. [0] scored 103 out of a total of 242 and the gamble paid off, as the gamble meant there was sufficient time to push for victory when an England collapse left England a target of only 107 to win. Australia slumped to 4/61, with [0] out for 16. An approaching storm threatened to wash the game out, but the poor weather held off and Australia managed to secure the win, a victory that retained the Ashes. For the only time in [0]'s life, the tension of the occasion got to [0] and [0] could not watch the closing stages of play, a reflection of the pressure that [0] felt all tour: [0] described the captaincy as \"exhausting\" and said [0] \"found it difficult to keep going\".The euphoria of securing the Ashes preceded Australia's heaviest defeat. At The Oval, England amassed a world record of 7/903 and England's opening batsman Len Hutton scored an individual world record, by making 364. In an attempt to relieve the burden on [0]'s bowlers, [0] took a rare turn at bowling. During [0]'s third over, [0] fractured [0]'s ankle and teammates carried [0] from the ground. With [0] injured and Jack Fingleton unable to bat because of a leg muscle strain, Australia were thrashed by an innings and 579\u00a0runs, which remains the largest margin in Test cricket history. Unfit to complete the 1938 tour of England, [0] left the team in the hands of vice-captain Stan McCabe. At this point, [0] felt that the burden of captaincy would prevent [0] from touring England again, although [0] did not make [0]'s doubts public.Despite the pressure of captaincy, [0]'s batting form remained supreme. [0] had replaced the blitzing style of [0]'s early days as the \"Boy from Bowral\". In 1938\u201339, [0] led South Australia to the Sheffield Shield and made a century in six consecutive innings to equal CB Fry's world record. [0] totalled 21\u00a0first-class centuries in 34\u00a0innings, from the beginning of the 1938 tour of England (including preliminary games in Australia) until early 1939.The next season, [0] made an abortive bid to join the Victoria state side. The Melbourne Cricket Club advertised the position of club secretary and [0] was led to believe that if [0] applied, [0] would get the position of club secretary. the position of club secretary was one of the most prestigious jobs in Australian cricket. The annual salary of \u00a31,000 would make [0] financially secure while allowing [0] to retain a connection with Australian cricket. On 18 January 1939, The Melbourne Cricket Club's committee, on the casting vote of the chairman, chose former Test batsman Vernon Ransford over [0].In August 1939, [0] won the South Australian squash championships, beating Australian Davis Cup tennis player Don Turnbull in the final.  Australian Davis Cup tennis player Don Turnbull won the first two games in the final and led 8-3 in the third game with five match points, but [0] won the third game and the fourth.  Australian Davis Cup tennis player Don Turnbull led 8-5 in the fifth game but [0] went on to win.The 1939\u201340 season was [0]'s most productive ever for SA: 1,448\u00a0runs at an average of 144.8. [0] made three double centuries, including 251 not out against NSW, the innings that [0] rated the best [0] ever played in the Sheffield Shield, as [0] tamed Bill O'Reilly at the height of [0]'s form. However, it was the end of an era. The outbreak of World War II led to the indefinite postponement of all cricket tours, and the suspension of the Sheffield Shield.", "Troubled war years": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] joined the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) on 28 June 1940 and was passed fit for air crew duty. the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) had more recruits than the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) could equip and train and [0] spent four months in Adelaide before the Governor-General of Australia, Lord Gowrie, persuaded [0] to transfer to the army, transfer[0]. Given the rank of lieutenant, [0] was posted to the Army School of Physical Training at Frankston, Victoria, to act as a divisional supervisor of physical training. The exertion of the job aggravated [0]'s chronic muscular problems, diagnosed as fibrositis. Surprisingly, in light of [0]'s batting prowess, a routine the army test revealed that [0] had poor eyesight.Invalided out of service in June 1941, [0] spent months recuperating, unable even to shave [0] or comb [0]'s hair due to the extent of the muscular pain he suffered. [0] resumed stockbroking during 1942. In his biography of Bradman, his expounded the theory that the muscular pain he suffered were psychosomatic, induced by stress and possibly depression; [0] read his biography of Bradman's manuscript and did not disagree. Had any cricket been played at 1942, [0] would not have been available. Although [0] found some relief in 1945 when referred to the Melbourne masseur Ern Saunders, [0] permanently lost the feeling in the thumb and index finger of [0]'s (dominant) right hand.In June 1945, [0] faced a financial crisis when the firm of Harry Hodgetts collapsed due to fraud and embezzlement. [0] moved quickly to set up [0]'s own business, utilising the firm of Harry Hodgetts's client list and [0]'s old office in Grenfell Street, Adelaide. The fallout led to a prison term for the firm of Harry Hodgetts, and left a stigma attached to [0]'s name in Adelaide's business community for many years.However, the SA Cricket Association had no hesitation in appointing [0] as the SA Cricket Association's delegate to the Board of Control in place of the firm of Harry Hodgetts. Now working alongside some of the men [0] had battled in the 1930s, [0] quickly became a leading light in the administration of the game. With the resumption of international cricket, [0] was once more appointed a Test selector, and played a major role in planning for post-war cricket.", "\"The ghost of a once-great cricketer\"": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 1945\u201346, [0] suffered regular bouts of fibrositis while coming to terms with increased administrative duties and the establishment of [0]'s business. [0] played for South Australia in two matches to help with the re-establishment of first-class cricket and later described [0]'s batting as \"painstaking\". Batting against the Australian Services cricket team, [0] scored 112 in less than two hours, yet Dick Whitington (playing for the Services) wrote, \"Dick Whitington (playing for the Services) have seen today the ghost of [0]\". [0] declined a tour of New Zealand and spent the winter of 1946 wondering whether [0] had played [0]'s last match. \"With the English team due to arrive for the 1946\u201347 Ashes series, the media and the public were anxious to know if [0] would lead Australia.\" [0]'s doctor recommended against a return to the game.Encouraged by [0]'s wife, [0] agreed to play in lead-up fixtures to the 1946\u201347 Ashes series. After hitting two centuries, [0] made [0] available for the First Test at The Gabba.Controversy emerged on the first day of the First Test at The Gabba. After compiling an uneasy 28 runs, [0] hit a ball to the gully fieldsman, Jack Ikin. \"An appeal for a catch was denied in the umpire's contentious ruling that a ball was a bump ball\". At the end of the over, England captain Wally Hammond spoke with [0] and criticised [0] for not \"walking\"; \"from then on the 1946\u201347 Ashes series was a cricketing war just when most people desired peace\", Dick Whitington (playing for the Services) wrote. [0] regained [0]'s finest pre-war form in making 187, followed by 234 during the Second Test at Sydney (Sid Barnes also scored 234 during the Second Test at Sydney, many in a still-standing record 405-run 5th-wicket partnership with [0]. Sid Barnes later recalled that Sid Barnes purposely got out on 234 because \"it wouldn't be right for someone to make more runs than [0]\"). Australia won both matches by an innings. Jack Fingleton speculated that had the decision at Brisbane gone against [0], [0] would have retired, such were [0]'s fitness problems. In the remainder of the 1946\u201347 Ashes series, [0] made three half-centuries in six innings, but [0] was unable to make another century; nevertheless, [0]'s won handsomely, scoring 3\u20130. [0] was the leading batsman on either side, with an average of 97.14. Nearly 850,000 spectators watched the 1946\u201347 Ashes series, which helped lift public spirits after pre-war.", "Century of centuries and \"The Invincibles\"": "Sir Donald Bradman is our person to focus on. [0] made [0]'s first tour of Australia in the 1947\u201348 season. On 15 November, Sir Donald Bradman made 172 against [0] for an Australian XI at Sydney, Sir Donald Bradman's 100th first-class century. The first non-Englishman to achieve the milestone, Sir Donald Bradman remains the only Australian to have done so. In five Tests, Sir Donald Bradman scored 715 runs (at 178.75\u00a0average). Sir Donald Bradman's last double century (201) came at Adelaide, and Sir Donald Bradman scored a century in each innings of the Melbourne Test. On the eve of the Fifth Test, Sir Donald Bradman announced that the Fifth Test would be Sir Donald Bradman's last in Australia, although Sir Donald Bradman would tour England as a farewell.Australia had assembled one of the great teams of cricket history. Sir Donald Bradman made it known that Sir Donald Bradman wanted to go through tour unbeaten, a feat never before accomplished. English spectators were drawn to the matches knowing that the matches would be English spectators's last opportunity to see Sir Donald Bradman in action. RC Robertson-Glasgow observed of Sir Donald Bradman that:Next to Mr. Winston Churchill, Sir Donald Bradman was the most celebrated man in England during the summer of 1948. Sir Donald Bradman's appearances throughout England were like one continuous farewell matin\u00e9e. At last Sir Donald Bradman's batting showed human fallibility. Often, especially at the start of the innings, Sir Donald Bradman played where the ball wasn't, and spectators rubbed spectators's eyes. Despite Sir Donald Bradman's waning powers, Sir Donald Bradman compiled 11 centuries on tour, amassing 2,428 runs (average\u00a089.92). Sir Donald Bradman's highest score of tour (187) came against Essex, when Australia compiled a world record of 721 runs in a day. In five Tests, Sir Donald Bradman scored a century at Trent Bridge, but the performance most like Sir Donald Bradman's pre-war exploits came in the Fourth Test at Headingley. England declared on the last morning of the Fourth Test at Headingley, setting Australia a world record 404 runs to win in only 345\u00a0minutes on a heavily worn pitch. In partnership with Arthur Morris (182), Sir Donald Bradman reeled off 173 not out and the Fourth Test at Headingley was won with 15\u00a0minutes to spare. The journalist Ray Robinson called won \"the 'finest ever' in won's conquest of seemingly insuperable odds\".In the final Test at The Oval, Sir Donald Bradman walked out to bat in Australia's first innings. Sir Donald Bradman received a standing ovation from the crowd and three cheers from the opposition. Sir Donald Bradman's Test batting average stood at 101.39. Facing the wrist-spin of Eric Hollies, Sir Donald Bradman pushed forward to the second ball that Sir Donald Bradman faced, was deceived by a googly, and was bowled between bat and pad for a duck. An England batting collapse resulted in an innings defeat, denying Sir Donald Bradman the opportunity to bat again and so his career average finished at 99.94; if Sir Donald Bradman had scored just four runs in Sir Donald Bradman's last innings, his career average would have been 100. A story developed over the years that claimed Sir Donald Bradman missed the ball because of tears in Sir Donald Bradman's eyes, a claim Sir Donald Bradman denied for the rest of Sir Donald Bradman's life.The Australian team won the Ashes 4\u20130, completed tour unbeaten, and entered history as \"The Invincibles\". Just as Sir Donald Bradman's legend grew, rather than diminished, over the years, so too has the reputation of the 1948 team. For Sir Donald Bradman, it was the most personally fulfilling period of Sir Donald Bradman's playing days, as the divisiveness of the 1930s had passed. Sir Donald Bradman wrote:Knowing the personnel, Sir Donald Bradman was confident that here at last was the great opportunity which Sir Donald Bradman had longed for. A team of cricketers whose respect and loyalty were unquestioned, who would regard Sir Donald Bradman in a fatherly sense and listen to Sir Donald Bradman's advice, follow Sir Donald Bradman's guidance and not question Sir Donald Bradman's handling of affairs...there are no longer any fears that the 1948 team will query the wisdom of what you do. The result is a sense of freedom to give full reign to your own creative ability and personal judgment.

[0]'s early development was shaped by the high bounce of the ball on matting-over-concrete pitches. [0] favoured \"horizontal-bat\" shots (such as the hook, pull and cut) to deal with the high bounce of the ball on matting-over-concrete pitches and devised a unique grip on the bat handle that would accommodate \"horizontal-bat\" shots (such as the hook, pull and cut) without compromising [0]'s ability to defend. Employing a side-on stance at the wicket, [0] kept perfectly still as the bowler ran in. [0]'s had a \"crooked\" look that troubled [0]'s early critics, but [0] resisted entreaties to change. [0]'s kept [0]'s hands in close to the body, leaving [0] perfectly balanced and able to change [0]'s stroke mid-swing, if need be. Another telling factor was the decisiveness of [0]'s footwork. [0] \"used the crease\" by either coming metres down the pitch to drive, or playing so far back that [0]'s feet ended up level with the stumps when playing the cut, hook or pull.[0]'s game evolved with experience. [0] temporarily adapted [0]'s technique during the Bodyline series, deliberately moving around the crease in an attempt to score from the short-pitched deliveries. At [0]'s peak, in the mid-1930s, [0] had the ability to switch between a defensive and attacking approach as the occasion demanded. After the Second World War, [0] adjusted to bat within the limitations set by [0]'s age, becoming a steady \"accumulator\" of runs. However, [0] never truly mastered batting on sticky wickets.

Indeed, in some respects, [0] was as powerful, persuasive and influential a figure off the ground as [0] was on the ground. In the late 1970s, [0] played an important role during the World Series Cricket schism as a member of a special Australian Cricket Board committee formed to handle the World Series Cricket schism. [0] was criticised for not airing an opinion, but [0] dealt with World Series Cricket far more pragmatically than other administrators. Australian captain Richie Benaud described [0] as \"a brilliant administrator and businessman\", warning that [0] was not to be underestimated. As Australian captain, Ian Chappell fought with [0] over the issue of player remuneration in the early 1950s and has suggested that [0] was parsimonious:Ian Chappell...thought to Ian Chappell, '[0], did [0] just ask [0] to fill [0]'s wallet with money?'

", "Cancellation of Apartheid South Africa's Australian Cricket Tour": "Sir Donald Bradman is our person to focus on. Despite [0] excluding black players from participating in national sports, many countries including Australia retained sporting relations with [0] until the mid 1970s. In this vein, the South African national cricket team was meant to tour Australia over the 1971\u201372 Australian summer. Public polls from the time suggested that, despite a group of very active protestors, around 75% of Australians wanted tour to go ahead\u2014believing that Australia should not interfere with South Africa's's domestic politics.Bradman, as Chair of the Australian Cricket Board, was initially sympathetic to wanted. Sir Donald Bradman expressed the view that white South African cricketers, many of whom had voiced their opposition to Apartheid and \"had tried harder than our [Australian] protestors to do something about it\", should not be punished for the decisions of white South African cricketers, many of whom had voiced their opposition to Apartheid and \"had tried harder than our [Australian] protestors to do something about it's . However, seeking to understand the situation better, Sir Donald Bradman travelled to South Africa's in June 1971.

On behalf of the Australian Cricket Board, Sir Donald Bradman made a one-line statement to the press: \"Australia will not play them [South Africa] until them [South Africa] choose a team on a non-racial basis.\".At the time, many disapproved of Bradman's decision to cancel to the tour. then South African Prime Minister John Vorster unsurprisingly decried Bradman's decision to cancel to the tour, calling Bradman's decision to cancel to the tour one by \"anarchists, communists and fellow travellers\". Even Australian Prime Minister William McMahon expressed regret at Bradman's decision to cancel to the tour, saying Bradman's decision to cancel to the tour had been wanted by a \"great many Australians\". Meanwhile, some Australian newspapers lamented that \"a small violent group of trouble-makers has won the day\" and that \"Sir Donald Bradman had 'conced[ed] defeat without a ball being bowled\". Bradman's decision to cancel to the tour was, however, praised in other media, and was well-received by anti-apartheid activists in South Africa's. Those who appreciated Bradman's decision to cancel to the tour included a then-imprisoned Nelson Mandela. After Sir Donald Bradman's death, a then-imprisoned Nelson Mandela prasied Sir Donald Bradman on public television\u2014stating that \"Sir Donald Bradman was a hero, a true hero\".Although Sir Donald Bradman became unwell and died before the two could meet, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser gifted a then-imprisoned Nelson Mandela a signed bat from Sir Donald Bradman, which read: \"To a then-imprisoned Nelson Mandela\u2014in recognition of a great, unfinished innings\".", "Later years and death": "[0] is our person to focus on.

In an oft-recited anecdote, Sachin Tendulkar was impressed with [0]'s sharpness and sense of humour at a meeting with his two favourite modern players, Shane Warne and Sachin Tendulkar: Sachin Tendulkar asked [0] a question: 'What would [0] have averaged in today's cricket?' [0] thought about it and said 'Maybe 70'. The natural reaction was 'Why only 70 and not 99?' [0] said, 'C'mon, that's not bad for a 90-year-old man.'
