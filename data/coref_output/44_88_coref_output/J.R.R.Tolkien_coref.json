[0] was English, and thought of [0] as such.[T 1]His immediate paternal ancestors were middle-class craftsmen who made and sold clocks, watches and pianos in London and Birmingham. The Tolkien family originated in the East Prussian town of Kreuzburg near K\u00f6nigsberg, which had been founded during the medieval German eastward expansion, where his earliest-known paternal ancestor Michel Tolkien was born around 1620. Michel's son Christianus Tolkien (1663\u20131746) was a wealthy miller in Kreuzburg.His son, Christian Tolkien (1706\u20131791), moved from Kreuzburg to nearby Danzig, and his two sons Daniel Gottlieb Tolkien (1747\u20131813) and Johann (later known as John) Benjamin Tolkien (1752\u20131819) emigrated to London in the 1770s and became the ancestors of The Tolkien family; Johann (later known as John) Benjamin Tolkien (1752\u20131819) was [0]'s second great-grandfather. In 1792, Johann (later known as John) Benjamin Tolkien (1752\u20131819) and William Gravell took over the Erdley Norton manufacture in London, which from then on sold clocks and watches under the name Gravell & Tolkien. Daniel Gottlieb Tolkien (1747\u20131813) obtained British citizenship in 1794, but Johann (later known as John) Benjamin Tolkien (1752\u20131819) apparently never became a British citizen. Other German relatives also joined his two sons Daniel Gottlieb Tolkien (1747\u20131813) and Johann (later known as John) Benjamin Tolkien (1752\u20131819) in London. Several people with the surname Tolkien or similar spelling, some of Several people with the surname Tolkien or similar spelling members of the same family as [0], live in northern Germany, but most of Several people with the surname Tolkien or similar spelling are descendants of people who evacuated East Prussia in 1945, at the end of World War II.According to Ryszard Derdzi\u0144ski, the surname Tolkien is of Low Prussian origin and probably means \"son/descendant of Tolk\". [0] mistakenly believed the surname Tolkien derived from the German word tollk\u00fchn, meaning \"foolhardy\", and jokingly inserted [0] as a \"cameo\" into The Notion Club Papers under the literally translated name Rashbold. However, Ryszard Derdzi\u0144ski has demonstrated derived to be a false etymology. While [0] [0] [0] was aware of The Tolkien family's German origin, [0]'s knowledge of The Tolkien family's history was limited because [0] was \"early isolated from the family of [0]'s prematurely deceased father\".", "Childhood": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was born on 3 January 1892 in Bloemfontein in the Orange Free State (later annexed by the British Empire; now Free State Province in the Republic of South Africa), to Arthur Reuel Tolkien (1857\u20131896), an English bank manager, and his wife Mabel, n\u00e9e\u00a0Suffield (1870\u20131904). Arthur Reuel Tolkien (1857\u20131896), an English bank manager, and his wife Mabel, n\u00e9e\u00a0Suffield (1870\u20131904) had left England when Arthur Reuel Tolkien (1857\u20131896), an English bank manager was promoted to head the Bloemfontein office of the British bank for which Arthur Reuel Tolkien (1857\u20131896), an English bank manager worked. [0] had one sibling, [0]'s younger brother, Hilary Arthur Reuel Tolkien, who was born on 17 February 1894.As a child, [0] was bitten by a large baboon spider in the garden, an event some believe to have been later echoed in [0]'s stories, although [0] admitted no actual memory of bitten and no special hatred of spiders as an adult. In an earlier incident from [0]'s infancy, a young family servant took [0] to a young family servant's homestead, returning [0] the next morning.When [0] was three, [0] went to England with Arthur Reuel Tolkien (1857\u20131896), an English bank manager, and his wife Mabel, n\u00e9e\u00a0Suffield (1870\u20131904) on what was intended to be a lengthy family visit. Arthur Reuel Tolkien (1857\u20131896), an English bank manager, however, died in South Africa of rheumatic fever before Arthur Reuel Tolkien (1857\u20131896), an English bank manager could join Arthur Reuel Tolkien (1857\u20131896), an English bank manager, and his wife Mabel, n\u00e9e\u00a0Suffield (1870\u20131904). died left the family without an income, so his wife Mabel, n\u00e9e\u00a0Suffield (1870\u20131904) took [0] to live with his wife Mabel, n\u00e9e\u00a0Suffield (1870\u20131904)'s parents in Kings Heath, Birmingham. Soon after, in 1896, the family moved to Sarehole (now in Hall Green), then a Worcestershire village, later annexed to Birmingham. [0] enjoyed exploring Sarehole Mill and Moseley Bog and the Clent, Lickey and Malvern Hills, which would later inspire scenes in [0]'s books, along with nearby towns and villages such as Bromsgrove, Alcester, and Alvechurch and places such as [0]'s aunt Jane's farm Bag End, the name of which [0] used in [0]'s fiction.his wife Mabel, n\u00e9e\u00a0Suffield (1870\u20131904) taught his wife Mabel, n\u00e9e\u00a0Suffield (1870\u20131904)'s at home.

[0] liked to draw landscapes and trees, but [0]'s favourite lessons were those concerning languages, and his wife Mabel, n\u00e9e\u00a0Suffield (1870\u20131904) taught [0] the rudiments of Latin very early.[0] could read by the age of four and could write fluently soon afterwards. his wife Mabel, n\u00e9e\u00a0Suffield (1870\u20131904) allowed [0] to read many books. [0] disliked Treasure Island and \"The Pied Piper\" and thought Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll was \"amusing but disturbing\". [0] liked stories about \"Red Indians\" (the term then used for Native Americans in adventure stories) and works of fantasy by George MacDonald. In addition, the \"Fairy Books\" of Andrew Lang were particularly important to [0] and the \"Fairy Books\" of Andrew Lang's influence is apparent in some of [0]'s later writings.his wife Mabel, n\u00e9e\u00a0Suffield (1870\u20131904) was received into the Roman Catholic Church in 1900 despite vehement protests by his wife Mabel, n\u00e9e\u00a0Suffield (1870\u20131904)'s Baptist family, which stopped all financial assistance to his wife Mabel, n\u00e9e\u00a0Suffield (1870\u20131904). In 1904, when [0] was 12, his wife Mabel, n\u00e9e\u00a0Suffield (1870\u20131904) died of acute diabetes at Fern Cottage in Rednal, which his wife Mabel, n\u00e9e\u00a0Suffield (1870\u20131904) was renting. his wife Mabel, n\u00e9e\u00a0Suffield (1870\u20131904) was then about 34 years of age, about as old as a person with diabetes mellitus type 1 could survive without treatment\u2014insulin would not be discovered until 1921, two decades later. Nine years after his wife Mabel, n\u00e9e\u00a0Suffield (1870\u20131904)'s , [0] wrote, \"his wife Mabel, n\u00e9e\u00a0Suffield (1870\u20131904) was a martyr indeed, and it is not to everybody that God grants so easy a way to God's great gifts as God did to Arthur Reuel Tolkien (1857\u20131896), an English bank manager, and his wife Mabel, n\u00e9e\u00a0Suffield (1870\u20131904), giving us a mother who killed his wife Mabel, n\u00e9e\u00a0Suffield (1870\u20131904) with labour and trouble to ensure us keeping the faith.\"Before his wife Mabel, n\u00e9e\u00a0Suffield (1870\u20131904)'s , his wife Mabel, n\u00e9e\u00a0Suffield (1870\u20131904) had assigned the guardianship of his wife Mabel, n\u00e9e\u00a0Suffield (1870\u20131904)'s to her close friend, Father Francis Xavier Morgan of the Birmingham Oratory, who was assigned to bring them up as good Catholics. In a 1965 letter to [0]'s son Michael, [0] recalled the influence of her close friend, Father Francis Xavier Morgan of the Birmingham Oratory, who was assigned to bring them up as good Catholics: \"her close friend, Father Francis Xavier Morgan of the Birmingham Oratory, who was assigned to bring them up as good Catholics was an upper-class Welsh-Spaniard Tory, and seemed to some just a pottering old gossip. her close friend, Father Francis Xavier Morgan of the Birmingham Oratory, who was assigned to bring them up as good Catholics was\u2014and her close friend, Father Francis Xavier Morgan of the Birmingham Oratory, who was assigned to bring them up as good Catholics was not. [0] first learned charity and forgiveness from her close friend, Father Francis Xavier Morgan of the Birmingham Oratory, who was assigned to bring them up as good Catholics; and in the light of charity and forgiveness pierced even the 'liberal' darkness out of which [0] came, knowing more about 'Bloody Mary' than his wife Mabel, n\u00e9e\u00a0Suffield (1870\u20131904).\"[T 2] After his wife Mabel, n\u00e9e\u00a0Suffield (1870\u20131904)'s , [0] grew up in the Edgbaston area of Birmingham and attended King Edward's School, Birmingham, and later St Philip's School.

While in [0]'s early teens, [0] had [0]'s first encounter with a constructed language, Animalic, an invention of his cousins, Mary and Marjorie Incledon. At that time, [0] was studying Latin and Anglo-Saxon. his cousins, Mary and Marjorie Incledon's interest in a constructed language, Animalic, an invention of his cousins, Mary and Marjorie Incledon soon died away, but Mary and others, including [0], invented a new and more complex language called Nevbosh. The next constructed language [0] came to work with, Naffarin, would be [0]'s own creation. [0] learned Esperanto some time before 1909. Around 10 June 1909 [0] composed \"The Book of the Foxrook\", a sixteen-page notebook, where the \"earliest example of one of his invented alphabets\" appears. Short texts in \"The Book of the Foxrook\", a sixteen-page notebook, where the \"earliest example of one of his invented alphabets\" appears are written in Esperanto.In 1911, while they were at King Edward's School, [0] and three friends, Rob Gilson, Geoffrey Bache Smith, and Christopher Wiseman, formed a semi-secret society they called the T.C.B.S. The initials stood for Tea Club and Barrovian Society, alluding to they's fondness for drinking tea in Barrow's Stores near King Edward's School and, secretly, in the school library. After leaving school, they stayed in touch and, in December 1914, they held a council in London at Christopher Wiseman's home. For [0], the result of a council was a strong dedication to writing poetry.In 1911, [0] went on a summer holiday in Switzerland, a trip that [0] recollected vividly in a 1968 letter,[T 3] noting that Bilbo's's journey across the Misty Mountains (\"including the glissade down the slithering stones into the pine woods\") is directly based on Bilbo's's adventures as their party of 12 hiked from Interlaken to Lauterbrunnen and on to camp in the moraines beyond M\u00fcrren. Fifty-seven years later, [0] remembered [0]'s regret at leaving the view of the eternal snows of Jungfrau and Silberhorn, \"the Silvertine (Celebdil) of [0]'s dreams\". their party of 12 went across the Kleine Scheidegg to Grindelwald and on across the Grosse Scheidegg to Meiringen. their party of 12 continued across the Grimsel Pass, through the upper Valais to Brig and on to the Aletsch glacier and Zermatt.In October of the same year, [0] began studying at Exeter College, Oxford. [0] initially read classics but changed [0]'s course in 1913 to English language and literature, graduating in 1915 with first-class honours. Among [0]'s tutors at Exeter College, Oxford was Joseph Wright, whose Primer of the Gothic Language had inspired [0] as a schoolboy.", "Courtship and marriage": "[0] is our person to focus on. At the age of 16, [0] met Edith Mary Bratt, who was three years his senior, when he and his brother Hilary moved into the boarding house where Edith Mary Bratt, who was three years his senior, lived in Duchess Road, Edgbaston. According to Humphrey Carpenter, \"Edith Mary Bratt, who was three years his senior, took to frequenting Birmingham teashops, especially one which had a balcony overlooking the pavement. There he and his brother Hilary would sit and throw sugarlumps into the hats of passers-by, moving to the next table when the sugar bowl was empty. ... With two people of he and his brother Hilary's personalities and in he and his brother Hilary's position, romance was bound to flourish. he and his brother Hilary were orphans in need of affection, and he and his brother Hilary found that he and his brother Hilary could give affection to each other. During the summer of 1909, he and his brother Hilary decided that he and his brother Hilary were in love.\"His guardian, Father Morgan, considered it \"altogether unfortunate\"[T 4] that \"His guardian, Father Morgan,'s was romantically involved with Edith Mary Bratt, who was three years his senior,; [0] wrote that the combined tensions contributed to [0]'s having \"muffed [[0]'s] exams\".[T 4] \"His guardian, Father Morgan, prohibited [0] from meeting, talking to, or even corresponding with Edith Mary Bratt, who was three years his senior, until [0] was 21.

[0] declared that [0] had never ceased to love Edith Mary Bratt, who was three years his senior,, and asked Edith Mary Bratt, who was three years his senior, to marry [0]. Edith Mary Bratt, who was three years his senior, replied that Edith Mary Bratt, who was three years his senior, had already accepted the proposal of George Field, the brother of one of her closest school friends. But Edith Mary Bratt, who was three years his senior, said Edith Mary Bratt, who was three years his senior, had agreed to marry George Field, the brother of one of her closest school friends only because Edith Mary Bratt, who was three years his senior, felt \"on the shelf\" and had begun to doubt that [0] still cared for Edith Mary Bratt, who was three years his senior,. Edith Mary Bratt, who was three years his senior, explained that, because of [0]'s letter, everything had changed.On 8 January 1913, [0] travelled by train to Cheltenham and was met on the platform by Edith Mary Bratt, who was three years his senior,. The two took a walk into the countryside, sat under a railway viaduct, and talked. By the end of 8 January 1913, Edith Mary Bratt, who was three years his senior, had agreed to accept the proposal of George Field, the brother of one of her closest school friends. Edith Mary Bratt, who was three years his senior, wrote to George Field, the brother of one of her closest school friends and returned Edith Mary Bratt, who was three years his senior,'s engagement ring. George Field, the brother of one of her closest school friends was \"dreadfully upset at first\", and the Field family was \"insulted and angry\". Upon learning of Edith Mary Bratt, who was three years his senior,'s new plans, family friend C. H. Jessop wrote to Edith Mary Bratt, who was three years his senior,'s guardian, \"family friend C. H. Jessop have nothing to say against [0], [0] is a cultured gentleman, but [0]'s prospects are poor in the extreme, and when [0] will be in a position to marry family friend C. H.

Had [0] adopted a profession it would have been different.\"Following The two's engagement, Edith Mary Bratt, who was three years his senior, reluctantly announced that Edith Mary Bratt, who was three years his senior, was converting to Catholicism at [0]'s insistence. family friend C. H. Jessop, \"like many others of family friend C. H. Jessop's age and class ... strongly anti-Catholic\", was infuriated, and family friend C. H. Jessop ordered Edith Mary Bratt, who was three years his senior, to find other lodgings.Edith Mary Bratt, who was three years his senior, were formally engaged at Birmingham in January 1913, and married at St Mary Immaculate Catholic Church at Warwick, on 22 March 1916. In [0]'s 1941 letter to Michael, [0] expressed admiration for Edith Mary Bratt, who was three years his senior,'s willingness to marry a man with no job, little money, and no prospects except the likelihood of being killed in the Great War.[T 4]", "First World War": "[0] is our person to focus on. In August 1914, Britain entered the First World War. [0]'s relatives were shocked when [0] elected not to volunteer immediately for the British Army. In a 1941 letter to [0]'s son Michael, [0] recalled: \"In those days chaps joined up, or were scorned publicly. It was a nasty cleft to be in for a young man with too much imagination and little physical courage.\"[T 4] Instead, [0], \"endured the obloquy\",[T 4] and entered a programme by which [0] delayed enlistment until completing [0]'s degree. By the time [0] passed [0]'s finals in July 1915, [0] recalled that the hints were \"becoming outspoken from relatives\".[T 4] [0] was commissioned as a temporary second lieutenant in the Lancashire Fusiliers on 15 July 1915. [0] trained with the 13th (Reserve) Battalion on Cannock Chase, Rugeley Camp near to Rugeley, Staffordshire, for 11 months. In a letter to Edith, [0] complained: \"Gentlemen are rare among the superiors, and even human beings rare indeed.\" Following their's wedding, their Mrs. Tolkien took up lodgings near Cannock Chase, Rugeley Camp near to Rugeley, Staffordshire,. On 2 June 1916, [0] received a telegram summoning [0] to Folkestone for posting to France. their spent the night before [0]'s departure in a room at the Plough & Harrow Hotel in Edgbaston, Birmingham. [0] later wrote: \"Junior officers were being killed off, a dozen a minute. Parting from Mrs. Tolkien then... it was like a death.\"On 5 June 1916, [0] boarded a troop transport for an overnight voyage to Calais. Like other soldiers arriving for the first time, [0] was sent to the British Expeditionary Force's base depot at \u00c9taples. On 7 June, [0] was informed that [0] had been assigned as a signals officer to the 11th (Service) Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers. the 11th (Service) Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers was part of the 74th Brigade, 25th Division. While waiting to be summoned to the 11th (Service) Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers, [0] sank into boredom. To pass the time, [0] composed a poem titled The Lonely Isle, which was inspired by [0]'s feelings during the sea crossing to Calais. To evade the British Army's postal censorship, [0] developed a code of dots by which Edith could track [0]'s movements. [0] left \u00c9taples on 27 June 1916 and joined the 11th (Service) Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers at Rubempr\u00e9, near Amiens. [0] found [0] commanding enlisted men who were drawn mainly from the mining, milling, and weaving towns of Lancashire. According to John Garth, [0] \"felt an affinity for enlisted men who were drawn mainly from the mining, milling, and weaving towns of Lancashire\", but military protocol prohibited friendships with \"other ranks\". Instead, [0] was required to \"take charge of enlisted men who were drawn mainly from the mining, milling, and weaving towns of Lancashire, discipline enlisted men who were drawn mainly from the mining, milling, and weaving towns of Lancashire, train enlisted men who were drawn mainly from the mining, milling, and weaving towns of Lancashire, and probably censor enlisted men who were drawn mainly from the mining, milling, and weaving towns of Lancashire's letters ... If possible, [0] was supposed to inspire enlisted men who were drawn mainly from the mining, milling, and weaving towns of Lancashire's love and loyalty.\" [0] later lamented, \"The most improper job of any man ... is bossing other men. Not one in a million is fit for bossing, and least of all those who seek the opportunity.[0] arrived at the Somme in early July 1916. In between terms behind the lines at Bouzincourt, [0] participated in the assaults on the Schwaben Redoubt and the Leipzig salient. [0]'s time in combat was a terrible stress for EdithEdith's . Edith could track Edith's movements on a map of the Western Front. The Reverend Mervyn S. Evers, Anglican chaplain to the Lancashire Fusiliers, recorded that [0] and [0]'s fellow officers were eaten by \"hordes of lice\" which found the Medical Officer's ointment merely \"a kind of hors d'oeuvre and the little beggars went at the little beggars's feast with renewed vigour.\" On 27 October 1916, as the 11th (Service) Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers attacked Regina Trench, [0] contracted trench fever, a disease carried by lice. [0] was invalided to England on 8 November 1916.According to [0]'s children John and Priscilla Tolkien, \"In later years, [0] would occasionally talk of being at the front: of the horrors of the first German gas attack, of the utter exhaustion and ominous quiet after a bombardment, of the whining scream of the shells, and the endless marching, always on foot, through a devastated landscape, sometimes carrying the men's's equipment as well as [0]'s own to encourage the men's to keep going. ... Some remarkable relics survive from that time: a trench map [0] drew [0]; pencil-written orders to carry bombs to the 'fighting line.'\"Many of [0]'s dearest school friends were killed in the First World War. Among their number were Rob Gilson of the Tea Club and Barrovian Society, who was killed on the first day of the Somme while leading his men in the assault on Beaumont HamelRob Gilson of the Tea Club and Barrovian Society, who was killed on the first day of the Somme while leading his men in the assault on Beaumont Hamel's . Fellow T.C.B.S. member Geoffrey Smith was killed during the battle, when a German artillery shell landed on a first-aid post. the 11th (Service) Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers was almost completely wiped out following [0]'s return to England.According to John Garth, Kitchener's Army, in which [0] served, at once marked existing social boundaries and counteracted the class system by throwing everyone into a desperate situation together. [0] was grateful, writing that the First World War had taught [0] \"a deep sympathy and feeling for the Tommy; especially the plain soldier from the agricultural counties\".[0] spent the remainder of the First World War alternating between hospitals and garrison duties, being deemed medically unfit for general service. During [0]'s recovery in a cottage in Little Haywood, Staffordshire, [0] began to work on what [0] called The Book of Lost Tales, beginning with The Fall of Gondolin. The Book of Lost Tales represented [0]'s attempt to create a mythology for England, a project [0] would abandon without ever completing. Throughout 1917 and 1918 [0]'s illness kept recurring, but [0] had recovered enough to do home service at various camps. It was at this time that Edith bore their first child, John Francis Reuel Tolkien. In a 1941 letter, [0] described their first child, John Francis Reuel Tolkien as \"(conceived and carried during the starvation-year of 1917 and the great U-boat campaign) round about the Battle of Cambrai, when the end of the war seemed as far off as the end of the war does now\".[T 4] [0] was promoted to the temporary rank of lieutenant on 6 January 1918. When [0] was stationed at Kingston upon Hull, their Edith went walking in the woods at nearby Roos, and Edith began to dance for [0] in a clearing among the flowering hemlock. After Edith's death in 1971, [0] remembered,[T 5]I never called Edith Luthien\u2014but Edith was the source of the story that in time became the chief part of the Silmarillion. the story that in time became the chief part of the Silmarillion was first conceived in a small woodland glade filled with hemlocks at Roos in Yorkshire (where [0] was for a brief time in command of an outpost of the Humber Garrison in 1917, and Edith was able to live with [0] for a while). In those days Edith's hair was raven, Edith's skin clear, her eyes brighter than you have seen her eyes, and Edith could sing\u2014and dance. But the story that in time became the chief part of the Silmarillion has gone crooked, & [0] am left, and [0] cannot plead before the inexorable Mandos.[T 5] On 16 July 1919, [0] was taken off active service, at Fovant, on Salisbury Plain, with a temporary disability pension.", "Academic and writing career": "J.R.R.Tolkien is our person to focus on. On 3 November 1920, [0] was demobilized and left the army, retaining [0]'s rank of lieutenant. [0]'s first civilian job after World War I was at the Oxford English Dictionary, where [0] worked mainly on the history and etymology of words of Germanic origin beginning with the letter W. In 1920, [0] took up a post as reader in English language at the University of Leeds, becoming the youngest member of the academic staff there. While at the University of Leeds, [0] produced A Middle English Vocabulary and a definitive edition of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight with E. V. Gordon; Sir Gawain and the Green Knight became academic standard works for several decades. [0] translated Sir Gawain, Pearl, and Sir Orfeo. In 1925, [0] returned to Oxford as Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon, with a fellowship at Pembroke College.[citation needed]In mid-1919, [0] began to tutor undergraduates privately, most importantly those of Lady Margaret Hall and St Hugh's College, given that the women's colleges were in great need of good teachers in the women's colleges's early years, and Tolkien as a married professor (then still not common) was considered suitable, as a bachelor don would not have been.During [0]'s time at Pembroke College [0] wrote The Hobbit and the first two volumes of The Lord of the Rings, while living at 20 Northmoor Road in North Oxford. [0] also published a philological essay in 1932 on the name \"Nodens\", following Sir Mortimer Wheeler's unearthing of a Roman Asclepeion at Lydney Park, Gloucestershire, in 1928.In the 1920s, [0] undertook a translation of Beowulf, which he finished in 1926, but did not publish. a translation of Beowulf, which he finished in 1926, but did not publish was later edited by [0]'s son Christopher and published in 2014.Ten years after finishing a translation of Beowulf, which he finished in 1926, but did not publish, [0] gave a highly acclaimed lecture on Beowulf, \"Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics\", which had a lasting influence on Beowulf research. Lewis E. Nicholson said that the article is \"widely recognized as a turning point in Beowulfian criticism\", noting that [0] established the primacy of the poetic nature of Beowulf as opposed to Beowulf's purely linguistic elements. At the time, the consensus of scholarship deprecated Beowulf for dealing with childish battles with monsters rather than realistic tribal warfare; [0] argued that the author of Beowulf was addressing human destiny in general, not as limited by particular tribal politics, and therefore monsters were essential to Beowulf. Where Beowulf does deal with specific tribal struggles, as at Finnsburg, [0] argued firmly against reading in fantastic elements. In the article, [0] also revealed how highly [0] regarded Beowulf: \"Beowulf is among [0]'s most valued sources\"; this influence may be seen throughout [0]'s Middle-earth legendarium.According to Humphrey Carpenter, [0] began [0]'s series of lectures on Beowulf in a most striking way, entering the room silently, fixing the audience with a look, and suddenly declaiming in English language the opening lines of Beowulf, starting \"with a great cry of Hw\u00e6t!\" It was a dramatic impersonation of an Anglo-Saxon bard in a mead hall, and It made the students realize that Beowulf was not just a set text but \"a powerful piece of dramatic poetry\". Decades later, W. H. Auden wrote to W. H. Auden's , thanking [0] for the \"unforgettable experience\" of hearing [0] recite Beowulf, and stating: \"The voice was the voice of Gandalf\".In the run-up to the Second World War, [0] was earmarked as a codebreaker. In January 1939, [0] was asked to serve in the cryptographic department of the Foreign Office in the event of national emergency.

During [0]'s life in retirement, from 1959 up to [0]'s death in 1973, [0] received steadily increasing public attention and literary fame. In 1961, [0]'s friend C. S. Lewis even nominated [0] for the Nobel Prize in Literature. The sales of [0]'s books were so profitable that [0] regretted that [0] had not chosen early retirement. In a 1972 letter, [0] deplored having become a cult figure, but admitted that \"even the nose of a very modest idol ... cannot remain entirely untickled by the sweet smell of incense!\"[T 7]Fan attention became so intense that [0] had to take [0]'s phone number out of the public directory,[T 8] and eventually he and Edith moved to Bournemouth, which was then a seaside resort patronized by the British upper middle class. [0]'s status as a best-selling author gave he and Edith easy entry into polite society, but [0] deeply missed the company of [0]'s fellow Inklings. Edith, however, was overjoyed to step into the role of a society hostess, which had been the reason that [0] selected Bournemouth, which was then a seaside resort patronized by the British upper middle class in the first place. The genuine and deep affection between he and Edith was demonstrated by he and Edith's care about the other's health, in details like wrapping presents, in the generous way [0] gave up [0]'s life at Oxford so Edith could retire to Bournemouth, which was then a seaside resort patronized by the British upper middle class, and in Edith's pride in [0]'s becoming a famous author. he and Edith were tied together, too, by love for he and Edith's children and grandchildren.In retire [0] was a consultant and translator for The Jerusalem Bible, published in 1966.

[0]'s Catholicism was a significant factor in C. S. Lewis's's conversion from atheism to Christianity, although [0] was dismayed that C. S. Lewis's chose to join the Church of England.

[0]'s fantasy writings have often been accused of embodying a racist attitude. Scholars have noted that [0] was influenced by Victorian attitudes to race and to a literary tradition of monsters, and that [0] was anti-racist in peacetime and during the World Wars. With the late 19th century background of eugenics and a fear of moral decline, some critics saw the mention of race mixing in The Lord of the Rings as embodying scientific racism. Other commentators saw in [0]'s orcs a reflection of wartime propaganda caricatures of the Japanese. Critics have noted, too, that The Lord of the Rings embodies a moral geography, with good in the West, evil in the East. Against embodies, scholars have noted that [0] was outraged in peacetime by Nazi racial theory, while during the Second World War [0] was equally disgusted by anti-German racial propaganda. Other scholars have stated that [0]'s Middle-earth is definitely polycultural and polylingual, and that attacks on [0] based on The Lord of the Rings often omit evidence from the text.", "Nature": "[0] is our person to focus on. During most of [0]'s own life conservationism was not yet on the political agenda, and [0] did not directly express conservationist views\u2014except in some private letters, in which [0] tells about [0]'s fondness for forests and sadness at tree-felling. In later years, a number of authors of biographies or literary analyses of [0] conclude that during [0]'s writing of The Lord of the Rings, [0] gained increased interest in the value of wild and untamed nature, and in protecting what wild nature was left in the industrialized world.", "": ""}, "Writing": {"Influences": "J.R.R.Tolkien is our person to focus on. [0]'s fantasy books on Middle-earth, especially The Lord of the Rings and The Silmarillion, drew on a wide array of influences including [0]'s philological interest in language, Christianity, medievalism, mythology, archaeology, ancient and modern literature, and personal experience. [0]'s philological work centred on the study of Old English literature, especially Beowulf, and [0] acknowledged Old English literature, especially Beowulf's importance to his writings. [0] was a gifted linguist, influenced by Germanic, Celtic, Finnish, and Greek language and mythology. Commentators have attempted to identify many literary and topological antecedents for characters, places and events in his writings. Some writers were important to [0], including the Arts and Crafts polymath William Morris, and [0] undoubtedly made use of some real place-names, such as Bag End, the name of [0]'s aunt's home. [0] acknowledged, too, John Buchan and H. Rider Haggard, authors of modern adventure stories that [0] enjoyed. The effects of some specific experiences have been identified. [0]'s childhood in the English countryside, and the English countryside's urbanization by the growth of Birmingham, influenced [0]'s creation of the Shire, while [0]'s personal experience of fighting in the trenches of the First World War affected [0]'s depiction of Mordor.", "Publications": "[0] is our person to focus on. In addition to writing fiction, [0] was an author of academic literary criticism. His seminal 1936 lecture, later published as an article, revolutionized the treatment of the Anglo-Saxon epic Beowulf by literary critics. His seminal 1936 lecture, later published as an article, remains highly influential in the study of Old English literature to this day. the Anglo-Saxon epic Beowulf is one of the most significant influences upon [0]'s later fiction, with major details of both The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings being adapted from the Anglo-Saxon epic Beowulf.His seminal 1936 lecture, later published as an article, discusses the fairy-story as a literary form. His seminal 1936 lecture, later published as an article, was initially written as the 1939 Andrew Lang Lecture at the University of St Andrews, Scotland. [0] focuses on Andrew Lang's work as a folklorist and collector of fairy tales. [0] disagreed with Andrew Lang's broad inclusion, in Andrew Lang's Fairy Book collections, of traveller's tales, beast fables, and other types of stories. [0] held a narrower perspective, viewing fairy stories as those that took place in Faerie, an enchanted realm, with or without fairies as characters. [0] viewed fairy stories as the natural development of the interaction of human imagination and human language.In addition to [0]'s mythopoeic compositions, [0] enjoyed inventing fantasy stories to entertain his children. [0] wrote annual Christmas letters from Father Christmas for his children, building up a series of short stories (later compiled and published as The Father Christmas Letters). Other works included Mr. Bliss and Roverandom (for children), and Leaf by Niggle (part of Tree and Leaf), The Adventures of Tom Bombadil, Smith of Wootton Major and Farmer Giles of Ham. Roverandom and Wootton Major, like The Hobbit, borrowed ideas from [0]'s legendarium.[0] never expected his stories to become popular, but by sheer accident a book called The Hobbit, which he had written some years before for his own children, came in 1936 to the attention of Susan Dagnall, an employee of the London publishing firm George Allen & Unwin, who persuaded [0] to submit a book called The Hobbit, which he had written some years before for his own children, for publication. When a book called The Hobbit, which he had written some years before for his own children, was published a year later, a book called The Hobbit, which he had written some years before for his own children, attracted adult readers as well as children, and a book called The Hobbit, which he had written some years before for his own children, became popular enough for the London publishing firm George Allen & Unwin to ask [0] to produce a sequel.The request for a sequel prompted [0] to begin what became [0]'s most famous work: the epic novel The Lord of the Rings (originally published in three volumes in 1954\u20131955). [0] spent more than ten years writing the primary narrative and appendices for The Lord of the Rings, during which time [0] received the constant support of the Inklings, in particular [0]'s closest friend C.\u00a0S.\u00a0Lewis, the author of The Chronicles of Narnia. both The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings are set against the background of The Silmarillion, but in a time long after The Silmarillion.[0] at first intended The Lord of the Rings to be a children's tale in the style of The Hobbit, but The Lord of the Rings quickly grew darker and more serious in the writing. Though a direct sequel to The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings addressed an older audience, drawing on the immense backstory of Beleriand that [0] had constructed in previous years, and which eventually saw posthumous publication in The Silmarillion and other volumes. [0] strongly influenced the fantasy genre that grew up after The Lord of the Rings's success.The Lord of the Rings became immensely popular in the 1960s and has remained so ever since, ranking as one of the most popular works of fiction of the 20th century, judged by both sales and reader surveys. In the 2003 \"Big Read\" survey conducted by the BBC, The Lord of the Rings was found to be the BBC's \"Best-loved Novel\". Australians voted The Lord of the Rings \"Australians's Favourite Book\" in a 2004 survey conducted by the Australian ABC. In a 1999 poll of Amazon.com customers, The Lord of the Rings was judged to be Amazon.com customers's favourite \"book of the millennium\". In 2002 [0] was voted the 92nd \"greatest Briton\" in a poll conducted by the BBC, and in 2004 [0] was voted 35th in the SABC3's Great South Africans, the only person to appear in both lists. [0]'s popularity is not limited to the English-speaking world: in a 2004 poll inspired by the BBC's \"Big Read\" survey, about 250,000 Germans found The Lord of the Rings to be about 250,000 Germans's favourite work of literature.[0] wrote a brief \"Sketch of the Mythology\", which included the tales of Beren and L\u00fathien and of T\u00farin; and a brief \"Sketch of the Mythology\", which included the tales of Beren and L\u00fathien and of T\u00farin eventually evolved into the Quenta Silmarillion, an epic history that Tolkien started three times but never published. [0] desperately hoped to publish the Quenta Silmarillion, an epic history that Tolkien started three times but never published along with The Lord of the Rings, but publishers (both Allen & Unwin and Collins) declined. Moreover, printing costs were very high in 1950s Britain, requiring The Lord of the Rings to be published in three volumes. The story of this continuous redrafting is told in the posthumous series The History of Middle-earth, edited by [0]. From around 1936, [0] began to extend this framework to include the tale of The Fall of N\u00famenor, which was inspired by the legend of Atlantis.[0] appointed [0] to be [0]'s literary executor, and [0] (with assistance from Guy Gavriel Kay, later a well-known fantasy author in his own rightGuy Gavriel Kay, later a well-known fantasy author in his own right's ) organized some of this material into a single coherent volume, published as The Silmarillion in 1977. The Silmarillion received the Locus Award for Best Fantasy novel in 1978.In 1980, [0] published a collection of more fragmentary material, under the title Unfinished Tales of N\u00famenor and Middle-earth. In subsequent years (1983\u20131996), [0] published a large amount of the remaining unpublished materials, together with notes and extensive commentary, in a series of twelve volumes called The History of Middle-earth. a series of twelve volumes called The History of Middle-earth contain unfinished, abandoned, alternative, and outright contradictory accounts, since a series of twelve volumes called The History of Middle-earth were always a work in progress for [0] and [0] only rarely settled on a definitive version for any of his stories. There is not complete consistency between both The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, because [0] never fully integrated all their traditions into each other. [0] commented in 1965, while editing The Hobbit for a third edition, that [0] would have preferred to rewrite The Hobbit completely because of the style of The Hobbit's prose.", "Manuscript locations": "J.R.R.Tolkien is our person to focus on.

Both [0]'s academic career and [0]'s literary production are inseparable from [0]'s love of language and philology. [0] specialized in English philology at university and in 1915 graduated with Old Norse as [0]'s special subject. [0] worked on the Oxford English Dictionary from 1918 and is credited with having worked on a number of words starting with the letter W, including walrus, over which [0] struggled mightily. In 1920, [0] became Reader in English at the University of Leeds, where [0] claimed credit for raising the number of students of linguistics from five to twenty. [0] gave courses in Old English heroic verse, history of English, various Old English and Middle English texts, Old and Middle English philology, introductory Germanic philology, Gothic, Old Icelandic, and Medieval Welsh. When in 1925, aged thirty-three, [0] applied for the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professorship of Anglo-Saxon at Pembroke College, Oxford, [0] boasted that [0]'s students of Germanic philology in Leeds had even formed a \"Viking Club\".[T 12] [0] also had a certain, if imperfect, knowledge of Finnish.Privately, [0] was attracted to \"things of racial and linguistic significance\", and in [0]'s 1955 lecture English and Medieval Welsh, which is crucial to [0]'s understanding of race and language, [0] entertained notions of \"inherent linguistic predilections\", which [0] termed the \"native language\" as opposed to the \"cradle-tongue\" which a person first learns to speak. [0] considered the West Midlands dialect of Middle English to be [0]'s own \"native language\", and, as [0] wrote to W. H. Auden in 1955, \"[0] am a West-midlander by blood (and took to Middle English as a known tongue as soon as [0] set eyes on it).\"[T 13]", "Language construction": "J.R.R.Tolkien is our person to focus on. Parallel to [0], and sometimes overshadowing [0], to the effect that Tolkien's's academic output remained rather thin, was Tolkien's's affection for constructing languages. The most developed of languages are Quenya and Sindarin, the etymological connection between which formed the core of much of Tolkien's's legendarium. Language and grammar for Tolkien's was a matter of aesthetics and euphony, and Quenya in particular was designed from \"phonaesthetic\" considerations; Quenya was intended as an \"Elven-latin\", and was phonologically based on Latin, with ingredients from Finnish, Welsh, English, and Greek.[T Tolkien's considered languages inseparable from the mythology associated with languages, and Tolkien's consequently took a dim view of auxiliary languages: in 1930 a congress of Esperantists were told as much by Tolkien's, in Tolkien's's lecture A Secret Vice, \"Your language construction will breed a mythology\", but by 1956 Tolkien's had concluded that \"Volap\u00fck, Esperanto, Ido, Novial, &c, &c, are dead, far deader than ancient unused languages, because ancient unused languages's authors never invented any Esperanto legends\".[T 15]The popularity of Tolkien's's books has had a small but lasting effect on the use of language in fantasy literature in particular, and even on mainstream dictionaries, which today commonly accept Tolkien's's idiosyncratic spellings dwarves and dwarvish (alongside dwarfs and dwarfish), which had been little used since the mid-19th century and earlier. (In fact, according to Tolkien's, had the Old English plural survived, the Old English plural would have been dwarrows or dwerrows.)

Queen Margrethe II of Denmark created illustrations to The Lord of the Rings in the early 1970s. Queen Margrethe II of Denmark sent illustrations to The Lord of the Rings to Tolkien, who was struck by the similarity illustrations to The Lord of the Rings bore in style to [0]'s own drawings.
