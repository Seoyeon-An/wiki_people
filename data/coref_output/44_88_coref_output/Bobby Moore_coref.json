In putting on the number six shirt, [0] replaced his mentor Malcolm Allison, who was suffering from tuberculosis.At international level, [0] played for the England national youth team. the England national youth team reached the UEFA Youth Tournament final in 1958, and won the British Amateur Youth Championship 1958.Alongside Geoff Hurst, both played in the 1959 FA Youth Cup final team that lost to Blackburn Rovers (1\u20132 on aggregate), but both were also in the team that won the Southern Junior Floodlit Cup (1\u20130 v Chelsea) later that year. [0] also played cricket for the Essex youth team alongside Geoff Hurst.his mentor Malcolm Allison, who was suffering from tuberculosis never played another first team game for West Ham United as [0] became a regular. A composed central defender, [0] was admired for [0]'s reading of the game and ability to anticipate opposition movements, thereby distancing [0] from the image of the hard-tackling, high-jumping defender. [0]'s ability to head the ball or keep up with the pace was average at best, but the way [0] read the game, marshalled [0]'s team and timed [0]'s tackles marked [0] out as world class. [0] was sent off once over the course of [0]'s West Ham United career, for a foul on Dave Wagstaffe in the final moment of a match against Manchester City in November 1961. The referee had simultaneously blown The referee's whistle for a foul on Dave Wagstaffe in the final moment of a match against Manchester City in November 1961 and for full-time. As red cards were not issued at that time, sent did not become apparent until after a match against Manchester City.", "An England star, a European winner": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 1960, [0] earned a call up to the England Under-23 squad. [0]'s form and impact on West Ham as a whole earned [0] a late call-up to the full England squad by Walter Winterbottom and The Football Association selection committee in 1962, when final preparations were being made for the summer's World Cup finals in Chile. [0] was uncapped as [0] flew to South America with the rest of the full England squad, but made [0]'s d\u00e9but on 20 May 1962 in England's's final pre-tournament friendly\u00a0\u2013 a 4\u20130 win over Peru in Lima. Also d\u00e9buting 20 May 1962 was Tottenham Hotspur defender Maurice Norman. Both proved so impressive that Both stayed in the full England squad for the whole of England's's participation in the World Cup, which ended in defeat by eventual winners Brazil in the quarter finals at Vi\u00f1a del Mar.On 29 May 1963, [0] captained England's for the first time in just [0]'s 12th appearance after the retirement of Johnny Haynes and an injury to his successor, Jimmy Armfield.

As well as gaining captainedEngland's , [0] lifted the FA Cup as West Ham as a whole defeated Preston North End 3\u20132 in the final at Wembley, courtesy of a last-minute goal from Ronnie Boyce. On a personal level, [0] was also successfully treated for testicular cancer and was named the Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year.The FA Cup success would become the first of three successful Wembley finals in as many years for [0]. In 1965, [0] lifted the European Cup Winners Cup after West Ham as a whole defeated 1860 Munich 2\u20130 in the final with both goals coming from Alan Sealey. By now [0] was the first choice captain for England's with 30 caps, and around whom new coach Alf Ramsey was building a team to prove correct new coach Alf Ramsey's prediction that they would win the 1966 World Cup.1966 had a mixed start for [0]. In January, [0] scored [0]'s first England's goal in a 1\u20131 draw with Poland at Goodison Park, but two months later captained West Ham as a whole to the final of the League Cup\u00a0\u2013 in West Ham as a whole's last season before the League Cup's transfer to Wembley as a one-off final\u00a0\u2013 which West Ham as a whole lost 5\u20133 on aggregate to West Bromwich Albion. For Moore, who had scored in the first leg, and [0]'s West Ham as a whole teammates Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters, considerable consolation lay ahead. [0] scored [0]'s second and ultimately final England's goal in a friendly against Norway, two weeks before the World Cup would begin.", "1966 World Cup": "[0] is our person to focus on. On the verge of [0]'s greatest triumph, details were released to the press in early 1966 that [0] wanted to leave West Ham. [0] had let [0]'s contract slip to termination, and only after the intervention of Sir Alf Ramsey and realisation [0] was technically ineligible to play, did [0] re-sign with West Ham to allow [0] to captain the England team of 1966. Sir Alf Ramsey had summoned West Ham manager Ron Greenwood to England's hotel and told the two of them the two of them to resolve the two of them's differences and get a contract signed up. [0] was the leader of the England team of 1966 and established [0] as a world-class player and sporting icon. With all the England team of 1966's games at Wembley, the England team of 1966 had got through the England team of 1966's group with little trouble, the England team of 1966 then beat Argentina in the England team of 1966's quarter final and a Eus\u00e9bio-led Portugal team in the semi-finals. West Germany awaited in the final.According to Geoff Hurst's's autobiography, England full back George Cohen overheard Sir Alf Ramsey talking to his coaching staff about the possibility of dropping [0] for the final and deploying the more battle-hardened Norman Hunter in [0]'s place. However, eventually his coaching staff settled on keeping [0] in the England team of 1966. [0] had not been playing badly, nor had [0] given the impression that [0] had been distracted by [0]'s contract dispute prior to World Cup. The only possible explanations were that West Germany had some rather fast attacking players, which could expose [0]'s own lack of pace, and the more battle-hardened Norman Hunter was the club partner of [0]'s co-defender with England, Jack Charlton.In the final, England went 1\u20130 down through Helmut Haller, but [0]'s awareness and quick-thinking helped England to a swift equaliser. [0] was fouled by Wolfgang Overath midway inside the German half and, rather than remonstrate or head back into defence, [0] picked [0] up quickly while looking ahead and delivered an instant free kick on to Geoff Hurst's's head, in a movement practised at West Ham. Geoff Hurst's scored.The West Ham connection to England's biggest day became stronger when Peters scored to take England 2\u20131 up, but West Germany equalised in the final minute of normal time through Wolfgang Weber\u00a0\u2013 as [0] appealed unsuccessfully for a handball decision\u00a0\u2013 to take the match into extra time.Sir Alf Ramsey was convinced West Germany were exhausted, and after Geoff Hurst's scored a controversial and heavily debated goal, the match looked over. With seconds remaining, and England under the pressure of another German attack, the ball broke to [0] on the edge of [0]'s own penalty area. Teammates shouted at [0] to just get rid of the ball, but [0] calmly picked out the feet of Geoff Hurst's 40\u00a0yards\u00a0(36\u00a0m) upfield, who scored to bring the score to 4\u20132.Of many memorable images from England's biggest day, one is of [0] wiping [0]'s hands clean of mud and sweat on the velvet tablecloth before shaking the hand of Queen Elizabeth II as Queen Elizabeth II presented [0] with the Jules Rimet trophy (World Cup).

[0] was also given an OBE in the New Year Honours List.[0]'s image and popularity allowed [0] to start a number of business ventures, including a sports shop next to West Ham's ground, Upton Park, and [0] also appeared with [0]'s wife Tina, along with Peters and Peters's wife Kathy, in a television advertisement for the pub industry, urging people to \"Look in at the local\".[0] continued to play for West Ham and England's, earning [0]'s 50th cap in a 5\u20131 win over Wales at the end of 1966 in a Home International match which also doubled up as a qualifier for the 1968 European Championships. England's ultimately reached the semi-finals (the 1968 European Championships was just a four-team event) where England's played Yugoslavia in Florence and lost 1\u20130. England's, as champions, did not have to qualify for the next World Cup, and [0] remained the first name on Ramsey's team sheet, winning [0]'s 78th cap prior to the squad's flight to South America for a short period of altitude-acclimatisation, before going on to the finals in Mexico.", "1970": "[0] is our person to focus on. The year 1970 was a bittersweet, mixed and eventful one for [0]. Retained as captain for the 1970 World Cup, there was however heavy disruption to preparations when an attempt was made to implicate [0] in the theft of a bracelet from a jeweller in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, where England were involved in a warm-up game. A young assistant had claimed that [0] had removed a bracelet from the hotel shop without paying for a bracelet. While [0] had been in a jeweller in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, where England were involved in a warm-up game (having entered with Bobby Charlton to look for a gift for Bobby Charlton's wife, Norma), no proof was offered to support claimed. [0] was arrested and then released. [0] then travelled with the England team to play another match against Ecuador in Quito. [0] played, winning [0]'s 80th cap, and England were 2\u20130 victors, but when the team plane stopped back in Colombia on the return to Mexico, [0] was detained and placed under four days of house arrest. Diplomatic pressure, plus the obvious weakness of the evidence, eventually saw the case dropped entirely, and [0] returned to Mexico to rejoin the England team and prepare for the 1970 World Cup. [0] received a guard of honour from the England team when [0] arrived at the team hotel.By common consent, [0]'s greatest game was the fabled 1970 World Cup group match against Brazil in Guadalajara. To crown it all of course is \"that tackle by [0]\" celebrated in song [\"Three Lions\"] and replayed a million times since. One hundred years from now when anyone asks what made [0] special, it will be the first piece of evidence.\u2014The Times, \"Most famous tackle looked like Superman stopping a train\".[0] went on to play a leading role in England's progress through their group. On 2 June [0] captained England to a 1\u20130 victory against Romania. In the second game against Brazil, there was a defining moment for [0] when [0] tackled Jairzinho with such precision and cleanness that tackled has been described as the perfect tackle. tackled continues to be shown on television around the world. Brazil still won tackled 1\u20130, but England progressed through their group. [0] swapped shirts with Pel\u00e9 after the fabled 1970 World Cup group match against Brazil in Guadalajara. The shirt was displayed at the National Football Museum in Manchester, courtesy of the Priory Collection. A 1\u20130 win over Czechoslovakia allowed England to finish second in their group and advance to the knockout stage.At the knockout stage, a rematch of the 1966 World Cup against West Germany, England took a 2\u20130 lead but lost 3\u20132 in extra time.

However, [0]'s services to West Ham were rewarded with a testimonial match against Celtic at the end of 1970.Although [0] was seen as an icon and a perfect influence on the game, [0] was not without [0]'s faults or controversies. On 7 January 1971, he and three West Ham teammates, Jimmy Greaves, Brian Dear and Clyde Best, were all fined by West Ham manager Greenwood after going out drinking in a nightclub until the early hours of the morning prior to an FA Cup third round tie against Blackpool. a nightclub was owned by [0]'s friend, boxer Brian London. West Ham lost an FA Cup third round tie against Blackpool 4\u20130. he and three West Ham teammates, Jimmy Greaves, Brian Dear and Clyde Best were all fined a week's wages. Blackpool were the bottom of Division one at the time, and were relegated at the end of the season. Coincidentally, [0] was featured on TV as the subject on This Is Your Life the night before.

Any other result would send Poland through. Being replaced by Norman Hunter in defence and Peters as the skipper for the return game at Wembley which England had to win to qualify, [0] is understood to have asked Ramsey if replaced meant [0] was no longer required, to which Ramsey replied: \"Of course not. Ramsey need [0] as Ramsey's captain at the World Cup next year.\" need never happened, as England could only draw 1\u20131. During the return game at Wembley which England had to win to qualify, Norman Hunter attempted to make a tackle but instead trod on the ball and lost the ball, lost[0]'s Chorz\u00f3w. Allan Clarke equalised with a penalty, but England could not score again as goalkeeper Jan Tomaszewski blocked numerous English chances.

[0] had a better head on [0]'s shoulders than any of the others, and even though [0] was coming towards the end of [0]'s career when [0] joined Fulham, [0] was still a great player and a tremendous asset. I remember his first ever pass to me. his first ever pass to me was very hard and to I's right, so I had to turn sharply to reach his first ever pass to me. I thought: '[0] only passed the ball 15 yards, so why didn't [0] pass the ball to I's feet?'
