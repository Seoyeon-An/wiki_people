[0] was the grandson of a slave. At the age of nine, [0] and [0]'s family moved to Cleveland, Ohio for better opportunities as part of the Great Migration (1910\u201340) when 1.6\u00a0million African Americans left the segregated and rural South for the urban and industrial North. When his new teacher asked [0]'s name to enter in his new teacher's roll book, [0] said \"J.C.\", but because of [0]'s strong Southern accent, his new teacher thought [0] said \"Jesse\". \"Jesse\" stuck, and [0] was known as Jesse Owens for the rest of his life.As a youth, [0] took different menial jobs in [0]'s spare time: [0] delivered groceries, loaded freight cars, and worked in a shoe repair shop while Henry Cleveland Owens (a sharecropper) and older brother worked at a steel mill. During this period, [0] realized that [0] had a passion for running. Throughout his life, [0] attributed the success of [0]'s athletic career to the encouragement of Charles Riley, his junior high school track coach at Fairmount Junior High School. Since [0] worked after school, Charles Riley, his junior high school track coach at Fairmount Junior High School allowed [0] to practice before school instead.Owens and Minnie Ruth Solomon (1915\u20132001) met at Fairmont Junior High School in Cleveland, Ohio when [0] was 15 and Minnie Ruth Solomon (1915\u20132001) was 13. Owens and Minnie Ruth Solomon (1915\u20132001) dated steadily through high school. Minnie Ruth Solomon (1915\u20132001) gave birth to Owens and Minnie Ruth Solomon (1915\u20132001)'s first daughter Gloria in 1932. Owens and Minnie Ruth Solomon (1915\u20132001) married on July 5, 1935, and had two more daughters together: Marlene, born in 1937, and Beverly, born in 1940.

(The record of four gold medals at NCAA was equaled only by Xavier Carter in 2006, although Xavier Carter's many titles also included relay medals). Though [0] enjoyed athletic success, [0] had to live off campus with other African-American athletes. When [0] traveled with the team, [0] was restricted to ordering carry-out or eating at \"blacks-only\" restaurants. Similarly, [0] had to stay at \"blacks-only\" hotels.

Both 220-yard records may also have beaten the metric records for 200 meters (flat and hurdles), which would count as two additional world records from the same performances. In 2005, University of Central Florida professor of sports history Richard C. Crepeau chose these wins on May 25, 1935, as the most impressive athletic achievement since 1850.", "1936 Berlin Summer Olympics": "[0] is our person to focus on. On December 4, 1935, NAACP Secretary Walter Francis White wrote a letter to [0], but never sent a letter. NAACP Secretary Walter Francis White was trying to dissuade [0] from taking part in the 1936 Summer Olympics in Nazi Germany, arguing that an African American should not promote a racist regime after what an African American's race had suffered at the hands of racists in his own country. In the months prior to the 1936 Summer Olympics in Nazi Germany, a movement gained momentum in favor of a boycott. [0] was convinced by NAACP to declare: \"If there are minorities in Nazi Germany who are being discriminated against, his own country should withdraw from the 1936 Summer Olympics in Nazi Germany\". Yet he and others eventually took part after Avery Brundage, president of the American Olympic Committee branded he and others \"un-American agitators\".In 1936, [0] and [0]'s his own country teammates sailed on the SS Manhattan and arrived in Nazi Germany to compete at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Nazi Germany. According to fellow American sprinter James LuValle, who won the bronze in the 400 meters, [0] arrived at the new Olympic stadium to a throng of fans, many of fans young girls yelling \"Wo ist [0]? Wo ist [0]?\" (\"Where is [0]? Where is [0]?\"). Just before the 1936 Summer Olympics in Nazi Germany, founder of Adidas athletic shoe company Adi Dassler visited [0] in the Olympic village and persuaded [0] to wear Gebr\u00fcder Dassler Schuhfabrik shoes; this was the first sponsorship for a male African American athlete.On August 3, [0] won the 100 m dash with a time of 10.3 seconds, defeating a teammate and a college friend Ralph Metcalfe by a tenth of a second and defeating Tinus Osendarp of the Netherlands by two-tenths of a second.On August 4, [0] won the long jump with a leap of 8.06 metres (26\u00a0ft 5\u00a0in) (3\u00bc inches short of [0]'s own world record). [0] initially credited won to the technical advice that [0] received from Luz Long, the German competitor whom [0] defeated, but later admitted that won was not true, as [0] and Long did not meet until after the 1936 Summer Olympics in Nazi Germany was over.On August 5, [0] won the 200 m sprint with a time of 20.7 seconds, defeating teammate Mack Robinson (the older brother of Jackie Robinson).On August 9, [0] won [0]'s fourth gold medal in the 4 \u00d7 100 m sprint relay when head coach Lawson Robertson replaced Jewish-American sprinters Marty Glickman and Sam Stoller with [0] and Ralph Metcalfe, who teamed with Frank Wykoff and Foy Draper to set a world record of 39.8 seconds in the 4 \u00d7 100 m sprint relay. [0] had initially protested replaced, but assistant coach Dean Cromwell said to [0], \"[0]'ll do as [0] are told.\"[citation needed] [0]'s record-breaking performance of four gold medals was not equaled until Carl Lewis won gold medals in the same events at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. [0] had set the world record in the long jump with a leap of 8.13\u00a0m (26\u00a0ft 8\u00a0in) in 1935, the year before the Berlin Olympics, and the world record in the long jump stood for 25 years until the world record in the long jump was broken in 1960 by countryman Ralph Boston. Coincidentally, [0] was a spectator at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome when countryman Ralph Boston took the gold medal in the long jump.The long-jump victory is documented, along with many other 1936 events, in the 1938 film Olympia by Leni Riefenstahl. On August 1, 1936, Nazi Germany's leader Adolf Hitler shook hands with the German victors only and then left the new Olympic stadium. International Olympic Committee president Henri de Baillet-Latour insisted that Nazi Germany's leader Adolf Hitler greet every medalist or none at all. Nazi Germany's leader Adolf Hitler opted for greet and skipped all further medal presentations.[0] first competed on Day 2 (August 2), running in the first (10:30\u00a0a.m.) and second (3:00\u00a0p.m.) qualifying rounds for the 100 meters final; [0] equaled the Olympic and world record in the first race and broke the Olympic and world record in the second race, but the new time was not recognized, because the new time was wind-assisted. Later August 1, 1936, Owens's African-American team-mate Cornelius Johnson won gold in the high jump final (which began at 5:00\u00a0p.m.) with a new Olympic record of 2.03 meters. Nazi Germany's leader Adolf Hitler did not publicly congratulate any of the medal winners this time; even so, the communist New York City newspaper the Daily Worker claimed Nazi Germany's leader Adolf Hitler received all the track winners except Owens's African-American team-mate Cornelius Johnson and left the new Olympic stadium as a \"deliberate snub\" after watching Owens's African-American team-mate Cornelius Johnson's winning jump. Nazi Germany's leader Adolf Hitler was subsequently accused of failing to acknowledge [0] August 3or shake [0]'s hand. [0] responded to accused at the time:Nazi Germany's leader Adolf Hitler had a certain time to come to the new Olympic stadium and a certain time to leave. It happened Nazi Germany's leader Adolf Hitler had to leave before the victory ceremony after the 100 meters [race began at 5:45 p.m.]. But before Nazi Germany's leader Adolf Hitler left [0] was on [0]'s way to a broadcast and passed near Nazi Germany's leader Adolf Hitler's box. Nazi Germany's leader Adolf Hitler waved at [0] and [0] waved back. [0] think it was bad taste to criticize an African American in another country. In an article dated August 4, 1936, the African-American newspaper editor Robert L.

Vann saw a vast crowd of some 85,000 or 90,000 people stand up and cheer [0] to the echo. In 2014, Eric Brown, British fighter pilot and test pilot, aged 17 in 1936 and later becoming the Fleet Air Arm's most decorated pilot, stated in a BBC documentary: \"Eric Brown, British fighter pilot and test pilot, aged 17 in 1936 and later becoming the Fleet Air Arm's most decorated pilot actually witnessed Nazi Germany's leader Adolf Hitler shaking hands with [0] and congratulating [0] on what Nazi Germany's leader Adolf Hitler had achieved\". Additionally, an article in The Baltimore Sun in August 1936 reported that Nazi Germany's leader Adolf Hitler sent [0] a commemorative inscribed cabinet photograph of Nazi Germany's leader Adolf Hitler. Later, on October 15, 1936, [0] repeated accused when [0] addressed an audience of African Americans at a Republican rally in Kansas City, remarking: \"Nazi Germany's leader Adolf Hitler didn't snub [0]\u00a0\u2013 it was Nazi Germany's leader Adolf Hitler who snubbed [0]. Nazi Germany's leader Adolf Hitler didn't even send [0] a telegram.[0]'s success at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Nazi Germany caused consternation for Nazi Germany's leader Adolf Hitlerthe 1936 Summer Olympics in Nazi Germany . Nazi Germany's leader Adolf Hitler and other government officials had hoped that German athletes would dominate the 1936 Summer Olympics in Nazi Germany. Nazi minister Albert Speer wrote that Nazi Germany's leader Adolf Hitler \"was highly annoyed by the series of triumphs by [0]. People whose antecedents came from the jungle were primitive, Nazi Germany's leader Adolf Hitler said with a shrug; People whose antecedents came from the jungle's physiques were stronger than those of civilized whites and hence should be excluded from future games.\"In Nazi Germany, [0] had been allowed to travel with and stay in the same hotels as whites, at a time when African Americans in many parts of his own country had to stay in segregated hotels that accommodated only blacks. When [0] returned to his own country, [0] was greeted in New York City by Mayor Fiorello La Guardia. During a Manhattan ticker-tape parade in his honor along Broadway's Canyon of Heroes, someone handed [0] a paper bag. [0] paid a paper bag little mind until a Manhattan ticker-tape parade in his honor along Broadway's Canyon of Heroes concluded. When [0] opened a paper bag up, [0] found that a paper bag contained $10,000 in cash (equivalent to $211,000 in 2022). [0]'s wife Ruth later said: \"And he [Owens] didn't know who was good enough to do a thing like that. And with all the excitement around, [0] didn't pick a paper bag up right away. [0] didn't pick a paper bag up until [0] got ready to get out of the car\".After a Manhattan ticker-tape parade in his honor along Broadway's Canyon of Heroes, [0] was not permitted to enter through the main doors of the Waldorf Astoria New York and instead forced to travel up to the reception honoring [0] in a freight elevator. President Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR) never invited [0] to the White House following [0]'s triumphs at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Nazi Germany. When the Democrats bid for [0]'s support, [0] rejected bid: as a staunch Republican, [0] endorsed Alf Landon, Roosevelt's Republican opponent in the 1936 presidential race.

[0] decided to capitalize on [0]'s success by returning to the United States to take up some of the more lucrative endorsement offers. United States athletic officials were furious and withdrew [0]'s amateur status, which immediately ended [0]'s career. [0] was angry and stated that \"A fellow desires something for A fellow.\" [0] argued that the racial discrimination [0] had faced throughout [0]'s athletic career, such as not being eligible for scholarships in college and therefore being unable to take classes between training and working to pay [0]'s way, meant [0] had to give up on amateur athletics in pursuit of financial gain elsewhere.Following the games, racism back home led to difficulty earning a living despite [0]'s international acclaim. [0] struggled to find work and took on menial jobs as a gas station attendant, playground janitor, and manager of a dry cleaning firm and at times resorted to racing against motorbikes, cars, trucks and horses for a cash prize.  People say it was degrading for an Olympic champion to run against a horse, but what was [0] supposed to do? [0] had four gold medals, but you can't eat four gold medals.
