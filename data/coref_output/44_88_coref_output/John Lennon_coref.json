In 1956, [0] formed The Quarrymen, which evolved into the Beatles in 1960. Sometimes called \"the smart Beatle\", [0] initially was the Beatles's de facto leader, a role [0] gradually ceded to Paul McCartney. Through [0]'s songwriting in the Beatles, [0] embraced myriad musical influences, initially writing and co-writing rock and pop-oriented hit songs in the Beatles's early years, then later incorporating experimental elements into [0]'s compositions in the latter half of the Beatles's career as his songs became known for his songs's increasing innovation. [0] soon expanded [0]'s work into other media by participating in numerous films, including How I Won the War, and authoring In [0]'s Own Write and A Spaniard in the Works, both collections of nonsense writings and line drawings. Starting with \"All You Need Is Love\", [0]'s songs were adopted as anthems by the anti-war movement and the larger counterculture of the 1960s. In 1969, [0] started the Plastic Ono Band with his second wife, the multimedia artist Yoko Ono, held the two-week-long anti-war demonstration Bed-ins for Peace, and left the Beatles to embark on a solo career.Between 1969 and 1972, Lennon and Ono his second wife, the multimedia artist Yoko Ono collaborated on many works, including a trilogy of avant-garde albums, several more films, [0]'s solo debut John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band, and the international top-10 singles  \"Give Peace a Chance\", \"Instant Karma!\", \"Imagine\", and \"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\".

[0] was born on 9 October 1940 at Liverpool Maternity Hospital to Julia (n\u00e9e Stanley) (1914\u20131958) and Alfred Lennon (1912\u20131976). Alfred Lennon (1912\u20131976) was a merchant seaman of Irish descent who was away at the time of Alfred Lennon (1912\u20131976)'s birth. Julia (n\u00e9e Stanley) (1914\u20131958) and Alfred Lennon (1912\u20131976) named [0] John Winston Lennon after [0]'s paternal grandfather, John \"Jack\" Lennon, and Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Alfred Lennon (1912\u20131976) was often away from home but sent regular pay cheques to 9\u00a0Newcastle Road, Liverpool, where [0] lived with Julia (n\u00e9e Stanley) (1914\u20131958); regular pay cheques stopped when Alfred Lennon (1912\u20131976) went absent without leave in February 1944. When Alfred Lennon (1912\u20131976) eventually came home six months later, Alfred Lennon (1912\u20131976) offered to look after the family, but Julia, by then pregnant with another man's child, rejected offered. After Julia (n\u00e9e Stanley) (1914\u20131958)'s complained to Liverpool's Social Services twice, Julia (n\u00e9e Stanley) (1914\u20131958) gave her sister Mimi's custody of [0].In July 1946, Alfred Lennon (1912\u20131976) visited her sister Mimi and took Alfred Lennon (1912\u20131976)'s to Blackpool, secretly intending to emigrate to New Zealand with Alfred Lennon (1912\u20131976). Julia (n\u00e9e Stanley) (1914\u20131958) followed them \u2013 with Julia (n\u00e9e Stanley) (1914\u20131958)'s partner at the time, Bobby Dykins \u2013 and after a heated argument, Alfred Lennon (1912\u20131976) forced [0] to choose between them. In one account of a heated argument, [0] twice chose Alfred Lennon (1912\u20131976), but as Julia (n\u00e9e Stanley) (1914\u20131958) walked away, [0] began to cry and followed Julia (n\u00e9e Stanley) (1914\u20131958). According to author Mark Lewisohn, however, Julia (n\u00e9e Stanley) (1914\u20131958) and Alfred Lennon (1912\u20131976) agreed that Julia (n\u00e9e Stanley) (1914\u20131958) should take [0] and give [0] a home. Billy Hall, who witnessed a heated argument, has said that the dramatic portrayal of [0] being forced to make a decision between Julia (n\u00e9e Stanley) (1914\u20131958) and Alfred Lennon (1912\u20131976) is inaccurate. [0] had no further contact with Alfred Lennon (1912\u20131976) for close to 20 years.Throughout the rest of [0]'s childhood and adolescence, [0] lived at Mendips, 251\u00a0Menlove Avenue, Woolton, with her sister Mimi and her sister Mimi's husband George Toogood Smith, who had no children of their own. [0]'s aunt purchased volumes of short stories for [0], and [0]'s uncle, a dairyman at [0]'s family's farm, bought [0] a mouth organ and engaged [0] in solving crossword puzzles. Julia (n\u00e9e Stanley) (1914\u20131958) visited Mendips on a regular basis, and [0] often visited Julia (n\u00e9e Stanley) (1914\u20131958) at 1\u00a0Blomfield Road, Liverpool, where Julia (n\u00e9e Stanley) (1914\u20131958) played [0] Elvis Presley records, taught [0] the banjo, and showed [0] how to play \"Ain't That a Shame\" by Fats Domino. In September 1980, [0] commented about the family and [0]'s rebellious nature:A part of [0] would like to be accepted by all facets of society and not be this loudmouthed lunatic poet/musician. But [0] cannot be what [0] am not\u00a0... [0] was the one who all the other boys' parents \u2013 including Paul's father \u2013 would say, \"Keep away from [0]\" ...\u00a0all the other boys' parents instinctively recognised [0] was a troublemaker, meaning [0] did not conform and [0] would influence all the other boys' parents's children, which [0] did. [0] did [0]'s best to disrupt every friend's home\u00a0... Partly out of envy that [0] didn't have this so-called home\u00a0... but [0] did ...\u00a0There were five women that were my family. five women that were my family. One happened to be my mother. [my mother] just couldn't deal with life. my mother was the youngest and my mother had a husband who ran away to sea and the war was on and my mother couldn't cope with [0], and [0] ended up living with my mother's elder sister. Now five women that were my family were fantastic\u00a0... And that was [0]'s first feminist education\u00a0... [0] would infiltrate the other boys' minds. [0] could say, \"Parents are not gods because [0] don't live with [0] and, therefore, [0] know.\" [0] regularly visited his cousin Stanley Parkes, who lived in Fleetwood and took him on trips to local cinemas. During the school holidays his cousin Stanley Parkes, who lived in Fleetwood and took him on trips to local cinemas often visited [0] with Leila Harvey, another cousin, and the three often travelled to Blackpool two or three times a week to watch shows. the three would visit the Blackpool Tower Circus and see artists such as Dickie Valentine, Arthur Askey, Max Bygraves and Joe Loss, with his cousin Stanley Parkes, who lived in Fleetwood and took him on trips to local cinemas recalling that [0] particularly liked George Formby. After his cousin Stanley Parkes, who lived in Fleetwood and took him on trips to local cinemas's family moved to Scotland, the three often spent the three's school holidays together there. his cousin Stanley Parkes, who lived in Fleetwood and took him on trips to local cinemas recalled, \"[0], cousin Leila and his cousin Stanley Parkes, who lived in Fleetwood and took him on trips to local cinemas were very close. From Edinburgh the three would drive up to the family croft at Durness, which was from about the time [0] was nine years old until [0] was about 16.\" [0]'s uncle George died of a liver haemorrhage on 5 June 1955, aged [0] was raised as an Anglican and attended Dovedale Primary School. After passing [0]'s eleven-plus exam, [0] attended Quarry Bank High School in Liverpool from September 1952 to 1957, and was described by Leila Harvey, another cousin at the time as a \"happy-go-lucky, good-humoured, easy going, lively lad\". However, [0] was also known to frequently engage in fights, bully and disrupt classes. Despite this, [0] quickly built a reputation as the class clown and often drew comical cartoons that appeared in [0]'s self-made school magazine, the Daily Howl.[nb 2]In 1956, Julia (n\u00e9e Stanley) (1914\u20131958) bought [0] his first guitar. his first guitar was an inexpensive Gallotone Champion acoustic for which Julia (n\u00e9e Stanley) (1914\u20131958) lent Julia (n\u00e9e Stanley) (1914\u20131958)'s five pounds and ten shillings on the condition that his first guitar be delivered to Julia (n\u00e9e Stanley) (1914\u20131958)'s own house and not her sister Mimi's, knowing well that Julia (n\u00e9e Stanley) (1914\u20131958)'s was not supportive of Julia (n\u00e9e Stanley) (1914\u20131958)'s musical aspirations. her sister Mimi was sceptical of [0]'s claim that [0] would be famous one day, and her sister Mimi hoped that [0] would grow bored with music, often telling [0], \"The guitar's all very well, [0], but [0]'ll never make a living out of The guitar.[0]'s senior school years were marked by a shift in [0]'s behaviour. Teachers at Quarry Bank High School in Liverpool described [0] thus: \"[0] has too many wrong ambitions and [0]'s energy is often misplaced\", and \"[0]'s work always lacks effort. [0] is content to 'drift' instead of using [0]'s abilities.\" [0]'s misbehaviour created a rift in [0]'s relationship with her sister Mimi.On 15 July 1958, at the age of 44, Julia (n\u00e9e Stanley) (1914\u20131958) was struck and killed by a car while Julia (n\u00e9e Stanley) (1914\u20131958) was walking home after visiting the Smiths' house. Julia (n\u00e9e Stanley) (1914\u20131958)'s traumatised [0]. Julia (n\u00e9e Stanley) (1914\u20131958)'s memory would later serve as a major creative inspiration for [0], inspiring songs such as the 1968 Beatles song \"Julia\".[0] failed [0]'s O-level examinations, and was accepted into the Liverpool College of Art after [0]'s aunt and headmaster intervened. At the Liverpool College of Art [0] began to wear Teddy Boy clothes and was threatened with expulsion for [0]'s behaviour. In the description of Cynthia Powell, [0]'s fellow student and subsequently [0]'s wife, [0] was \"thrown out of the Liverpool College of Art before [0]'s final year\"."}, "The Quarrymen to the Beatles: 1956\u20131970": {"Formation, fame and touring: 1956\u20131966": "[0] is our person to focus on. At the age of 15, [0] formed a skiffle group, the Quarrymen. Named after Quarry Bank High School, a skiffle group, the Quarrymen was established by [0] in September 1956. By the summer of 1957, a skiffle group, the Quarrymen played a \"spirited set of songs\" made up of half skiffle and half rock and roll. [0] first met Paul McCartney at a skiffle group, the Quarrymen's second performance, which was held in Woolton on 6 July at the St Peter's Church garden f\u00eate. [0] then asked Paul McCartney to join a skiffle group, the Quarrymen.Paul McCartney said that Aunt Mimi \"was very aware that [0]'s friends were lower class\", and would often patronise [0] when [0] arrived to visit [0]. According to Paul McCartney's brother Mike, their father similarly disapproved of [0], declaring that [0] would get their father's \"into trouble\". their father nevertheless allowed a skiffle group, the Quarrymen to rehearse in the family's front room at 20\u00a0Forthlin Road. During rehearse [0] wrote [0]'s first song, \"Hello Little Girl\", which became a UK top 10 hit for the Fourmost in Paul McCartney recommended that his friend George Harrison become the lead guitarist. [0] thought that Harrison, then 14 years old, was too young. Paul McCartney engineered an audition on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus, where his friend George Harrison played \"Raunchy\" for [0] and was asked to join. Stuart Sutcliffe, Lennon's friend from art school, later joined as bassist. [0], Paul McCartney, his friend George Harrison and Stuart Sutcliffe, Lennon's friend from art school, became \"The Beatles\" in early 1960. In August early 1960, a skiffle group, the Quarrymen were engaged for a 48-night residency in Hamburg, in West Germany, and were desperately in need of a drummer. a skiffle group, the Quarrymen asked Pete Best to join a skiffle group, the Quarrymen. Aunt Mimi, horrified when [0] told Aunt Mimi about the trip, pleaded with [0] to continue [0]'s art studies instead. After a 48-night residency in Hamburg, in West Germany, a skiffle group, the Quarrymen accepted another in April 1961, and a third in April 1962. As with the other band members, [0] was introduced to Preludin while in Hamburg, in West Germany, and regularly took Preludin as a stimulant during a skiffle group, the Quarrymen's long, overnight performances.Brian Epstein managed a skiffle group, the Quarrymen from 1962 until Brian Epstein's death in 1967. Brian Epstein had no previous experience managing artists, but Brian Epstein had a strong influence on a skiffle group, the Quarrymen's dress code and attitude on stage. [0] initially resisted Brian Epstein's attempts to encourage a skiffle group, the Quarrymen to present a professional appearance, but eventually complied, saying \"[0]'ll wear a bloody balloon if somebody's going to pay [0].\" Paul McCartney took over on bass after Stuart Sutcliffe, Lennon's friend from art school, decided to stay in Hamburg, in West Germany, and Pete Best was replaced with drummer Ringo Starr; this completed the four-piece line-up that would remain until a skiffle group, the Quarrymen's break-up in 1970. a skiffle group, the Quarrymen's first single, \"Love Me Do\", was released in October 1962 and reached No. 17 on the British charts. a skiffle group, the Quarrymen recorded their debut album, Please Please Me, in under 10 hours on 11 February 1963, a day when [0] was suffering the effects of a cold, which is evident in the vocal on the last song to be recorded 11 February 1963, \"Twist and Shout\". The Lennon\u2013McCartney songwriting partnership yielded eight of their debut album, Please Please Me,'s fourteen tracks. With a few exceptions, one being the album title itselfthe album title itself, [0] had yet to bring [0]'s love of wordplay to bear on [0]'s song lyrics, saying: \"The Lennon\u2013McCartney songwriting partnership were just writing songs\u00a0... pop songs with no more thought of pop songs than pop songs \u2013 to create a sound. And the words were almost irrelevant\". In a 1987 interview, Paul McCartney said that the other Beatles idolised [0]: \"[0] was like the other Beatles's own little Elvis\u00a0... the other Beatles looked up to [0]. [0] was older and [0] was very much the leader; [0] was the quickest wit and the smartest.\"The Beatles achieved mainstream success in the UK early in 1963. [0] was on tour when [0]'s first son, Julian, was born in April. During a skiffle group, the Quarrymen's Royal Variety Show performance, which was attended by the Queen Mother and other British royalty, [0] poked fun at the audience: \"For a skiffle group, the Quarrymen's next song, [0]'d like to ask for the audience's help. For the people in the cheaper seats, clap the audience's hands\u00a0... and the rest of you, if the audience'll just rattle the audience's jewellery.\" After a year of Beatlemania in the UK, a skiffle group, the Quarrymen's historic February 1964 US debut appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show marked a skiffle group, the Quarrymen's breakthrough to international stardom. A two-year period of constant touring, filmmaking, and songwriting followed, during which [0] wrote two books, In [0]'s Own Write and A Spaniard in the Works. a skiffle group, the Quarrymen received recognition from the British establishment when a skiffle group, the Quarrymen were appointed Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1965 Queen's Birthday Honours.[0] grew concerned that fans who attended a skiffle group, the Quarrymen concerts were unable to hear the music above the screaming of fans, and that a skiffle group, the Quarrymen's musicianship was beginning to suffer as a result. [0]'s \"Help!\" expressed [0]'s own feelings in 1965: \"[0] meant it\u00a0... It was [0] singing 'help'\". [0] had put on weight ([0] would later refer to this as [0]'s \"Fat Elvis\" period), and felt [0] was subconsciously seeking change. In March 1965 he and Harrison his friend George Harrison were unknowingly introduced to LSD when a dentist, hosting a dinner party attended by the two musicians and their wives, spiked the two musicians and their wives's coffee with LSD. When the two musicians and their wives wanted to leave, a dentist, hosting a dinner party attended by the two musicians and their wives, revealed what the two musicians and their wives had taken, and strongly advised the two musicians and their wives not to leave the house because of the likely effects. Later, in a lift at a nightclub, the two musicians and their wives believed a lift at a nightclub was on fire; [0] recalled: \"the two musicians and their wives were all screaming\u00a0... hot and hysterical.\"In March 1966, during an interview with Evening Standard reporter Maureen Cleave, [0] remarked, \"Christianity will go. Christianity will vanish and shrink\u00a0... a skiffle group, the Quarrymen're more popular than Jesus now \u2013 [0] don't know which will go first, rock and roll or Christianity.\" remarked went virtually unnoticed in England but caused great offence in the US when quoted by a magazine there five months later. The furore that followed, which included the burning of a skiffle group, the Quarrymen records, Ku Klux Klan activity and threats against [0], contributed to a skiffle group, the Quarrymen's decision to stop touring.", "Studio years, break-up and solo work: 1966\u20131970": "[0] is our person to focus on. After the band's's final concert on 29 August 1966, [0] filmed the anti-war black comedy How I Won the War \u2013 [0]'s only appearance in a non-the band's feature film \u2013 before rejoining [0]'s bandmates for an extended period of recording, beginning in November. [0] had increased [0]'s use of LSD and, according to author Ian MacDonald, [0]'s continuous use of LSD in 1967 brought [0] \"close to erasing [0]'s identity\". 1967 saw the release of \"Strawberry Fields Forever\", hailed by Time magazine for its \"astonishing inventiveness\", and the band's's landmark album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, which revealed lyrics by [0] that contrasted strongly with the simple love songs of the band's's early years.In late June, the band's performed Lennon's \"All You Need Is Love\" as Britain's's contribution to the Our World satellite broadcast, before an international audience estimated at up to 400\u00a0million. Intentionally simplistic in Lennon's \"All You Need Is Love\"'s message, Lennon's \"All You Need Is Love\" formalised [0]'s pacifist stance and provided an anthem for the Summer of Love. After the band's were introduced to the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the band's attended an August weekend of personal instruction at the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's Transcendental Meditation seminar in Bangor, Wales. During an August weekend of personal instruction, the band's were informed of Epstein's's death. \"[0] knew the band's were in trouble then\", [0] said later. \"[0] didn't have any misconceptions about the band's's ability to do anything other than play music. [0] was scared \u2013 [0] thought, 'the band's've fucking had it now.'\" McCartney organised the group's first post-Epstein project, the self-written, -produced and -directed television film Magical Mystery Tour, which was released in December that year. While the group's first post-Epstein project, the self-written, -produced and -directed television film Magical Mystery Tour, which was released in December that year proved to be the band's's first critical flop, the group's first post-Epstein project, the self-written, -produced and -directed television film Magical Mystery Tour, which was released in December that year's soundtrack release, featuring [0]'s Lewis Carroll-inspired \"I Am the Walrus\", was a success.Led by Harrison and Lennon's interest, the band's travelled to the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's ashram in India in February 1968 for further guidance. While there, the band's composed most of the songs for their double album The Beatles, but the band's's mixed experience with Transcendental Meditation signalled a sharp divergence in the band's's camaraderie. On the band's's return to London, the band's became increasingly involved in business activities with the formation of Apple Corps, a multimedia corporation composed of Apple Records and several other subsidiary companies. [0] described Apple Corps, a multimedia corporation composed of Apple Records and several other subsidiary companies as an attempt to achieve \"artistic freedom within a business structure\". Released amid the Protests of 1968, the band's's debut single for Apple Records included Lennon's B-side \"Revolution\", in which he called for a \"plan\" rather than committing to Maoist revolution. Lennon's B-side \"Revolution\", in which he called for a \"plan\" rather than committing to Maoist revolution's pacifist message led to ridicule from political radicals in the New Left press. Adding to the tensions at the band's's recording sessions 1968, [0] insisted on having his new girlfriend, the Japanese artist Yoko Ono, beside [0], thereby contravening the band's's policy regarding wives and girlfriends in the studio. [0] was especially pleased with [0]'s songwriting contributions to their double album The Beatles and identified their double album The Beatles as a superior work to Sgt. Pepper. At the end of 1968, [0] participated in The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus, a television special that was not broadcast. [0] performed with the Dirty Mac, a supergroup composed of Lennon, Eric Clapton, Keith Richards and Mitch Mitchell. the Dirty Mac, a supergroup composed of Lennon, Eric Clapton, Keith Richards and Mitch Mitchell also backed a vocal performance by his new girlfriend, the Japanese artist Yoko Ono. A film version was released in 1996.By late 1968, [0]'s increased drug use and growing preoccupation with his new girlfriend, the Japanese artist Yoko Ono, combined with the band's's inability to agree on how Apple Corps, a multimedia corporation composed of Apple Records and several other subsidiary companies should be run, left Apple Records in need of professional management. [0] asked Lord Beeching to take on the role but Lord Beeching declined, advising [0] to go back to making records. [0] was approached by Allen Klein, who had managed the Rolling Stones and other bands during the British Invasion. In early 1969, Allen Klein, who had managed the Rolling Stones and other bands during the British Invasion was appointed as Apple Records's chief executive by [0], Harrison and Starr but McCartney never signed the management contract.Lennon and Ono his new girlfriend, the Japanese artist Yoko Ono were married on 20 March 1969 and soon released a series of 14 lithographs called \"Bag One\" depicting scenes from Lennon and Ono's honeymoon, eight of which were deemed indecent and most of which were banned and confiscated. [0]'s creative focus continued to move beyond the band's, and between 1968 and 1969 Lennon and Ono his new girlfriend, the Japanese artist Yoko Ono recorded three albums of experimental music together: Unfinished Music No. 1: Two Virgins (known more for its cover than for its music)Unfinished Music No. 1: Two Virgins (known more for its cover than for its music)'s Unfinished Music No. 1: Two Virgins (known more for its cover than for its music)'s , Unfinished Music No. 2: Life with the Lions and Wedding Album. In 1969, Lennon and Ono formed the Plastic Ono Band, releasing Live Peace in Toronto 1969. Between 1969 and 1970, [0] released the singles \"Give Peace a Chance\", which was widely adopted as an anti-Vietnam War anthem, \"Cold Turkey\", which documented his withdrawal symptoms after he became addicted to heroin, and \"Instant Karma!\".In protest at Britain's's involvement in \"the Nigeria-Biafra thing\" (namely, the Nigerian Civil War), Britain's's support of America in the Vietnam War and (perhaps jokingly) against \"Cold Turkey\", which documented his withdrawal symptoms after he became addicted to heroin slipping down the charts, [0] returned his MBE medal to the Queen. returned had no effect on [0]'s MBE status, which could not be renounced. his MBE medal, together with [0]'s letter, is held at the Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood.[0] left the band's on 20 September 1969, but agreed not to inform the media while the band's renegotiated the band's's recording contract. [0] was outraged that McCartney publicised McCartney's own departure on releasing McCartney's debut solo album in April 1970. [0]'s reaction was, \"Jesus Christ! McCartney gets all the credit for it!\" [0] later wrote, \"[0] started the band's. [0] disbanded the band's. It's as simple as that.\" In a December 1970 interview with Jann Wenner of Rolling Stone magazine, [0] revealed [0]'s bitterness towards McCartney, saying, \"[0] was a fool not to do what Paul did, which was use it to sell a record.\" [0] also spoke of the hostility [0] perceived the other members had towards his new girlfriend, the Japanese artist Yoko Ono, and of how he, Harrison and Starr \"got fed up with being sidemen for Paul... After Epstein's died he, Harrison and Starr collapsed. Paul took over and supposedly led he, Harrison and Starr.

The only thing [0] don't know how to handle is non-violence and humor.\u2014John LennonBetween 1 April and 15 September 1970, Lennon and Ono went through primal therapy with Arthur Janov at Tittenhurst, in London and at Arthur Janov's clinic in Los Angeles, California. Designed to release emotional pain from early childhood, primal therapy with Arthur Janov entailed two half-days a week with Arthur Janov for six months; Arthur Janov had wanted to treat Lennon and Ono for longer, but Lennon and Ono's American visa ran out and Lennon and Ono had to return to the UK. Lennon's debut solo album, John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band (1970), was received with praise by many music critics, but Lennon's debut solo album, John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band (1970)'s highly personal lyrics and stark sound limited Lennon's debut solo album, John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band (1970)'s commercial performance. Lennon's debut solo album, John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band (1970) featured the song \"Mother\", in which John Lennon confronted John Lennon's feelings of childhood rejection, and the Dylanesque \"Working Class Hero\", a bitter attack against the bourgeois social system which, due to the lyric \"you're still fucking peasants\", fell foul of broadcasters.In January 1971, Tariq Ali expressed Tariq Ali's revolutionary political views when Tariq Ali interviewed Lennon, who immediately responded by writing \"Power to the People\". In John Lennon's lyrics to \"Power to the People\", John Lennon reversed the non-confrontational approach John Lennon had espoused in \"Revolution\", although John Lennon later disowned \"Power to the People\", saying that \"Power to the People\" was borne out of guilt and a desire for approval from radicals such as Tariq Ali. John Lennon became involved in a protest against the prosecution of Oz magazine for alleged obscenity. John Lennon denounced the prosecution of Oz magazine for alleged obscenity as \"disgusting fascism\", and Lennon and Ono (as Elastic Oz Band) released the single \"God Save Us/Do the Oz\" and joined marches in support of Oz magazine.Eager for a major commercial success, John Lennon adopted a more accessible sound for his next album, Imagine (1971). Rolling Stone reported that \"his next album, Imagine (1971) contains a substantial portion of good music\" but warned of the possibility that \"John Lennon's posturings will soon seem not merely dull but irrelevant\". Lennon's debut solo album, John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band (1970)'s title track later became an anthem for anti-war movements, while the song \"How Do You Sleep?\" was a musical attack on McCartney in response to lyrics on Ram that John Lennon felt, and McCartney later confirmed, were directed at John Lennon and Ono.[nb 3] In \"Jealous Guy\", John Lennon addressed John Lennon's demeaning treatment of women, acknowledging that John Lennon's past behaviour was the result of long-held insecurity.In gratitude for John Lennon's guitar contributions to Imagine, John Lennon initially agreed to perform at Harrison's Concert for Bangladesh benefit shows in New York. Harrison's refused to allow Ono to participate at Bangladesh benefit shows, however, which resulted in Lennon and Ono having a heated argument and John Lennon pulling out of Harrison's Concert for Bangladesh benefit shows in New York.Lennon and Ono moved to New York in August 1971 and immediately embraced US radical left politics. Lennon and Ono released Lennon and Ono's \"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\" single in December. During December, the Nixon administration took what the Nixon administration called a \"strategic counter-measure\" against John Lennon's anti-war and anti-Nixon propaganda. the Nixon administration embarked on what would be a four-year attempt to deport John Lennon. John Lennon was embroiled in a continuing legal battle with the immigration authorities, and John Lennon was denied permanent residency in the US; the issue would not be resolved until 1976.Some Time in New York City was recorded as a collaboration with Ono and was released in 1972 with backing from the New York band Elephant's's Memory. A double LP, 1976.Some Time in New York City contained songs about women's rights, race relations, Britain's role in Northern Ireland and John Lennon's difficulties in obtaining a green card. 1976.Some Time in New York City was a commercial failure and was maligned by critics, who found 1976.Some Time in New York City's political sloganeering heavy-handed and relentless. The NME's review took the form of an open letter in which Tony Tyler derided John Lennon as a \"pathetic, ageing revolutionary\". In the US, \"Woman Is the Nigger of the World\" was released as a single from 1976.Some Time in New York City and was televised on 11 May, on The Dick Cavett Show. Many radio stations refused to broadcast \"Power to the People\" because of the word \"nigger\".Lennon and Ono gave two benefit concerts with Elephant's Memory and guests in New York in aid of patients at the Willowbrook State School mental facility. Staged at Madison Square Garden on 30 August 1972, two benefit concerts with Elephant's Memory and guests were John Lennon's last full-length concert appearances. After George McGovern lost the 1972 presidential election to Richard Nixon, Lennon and Ono attended a post-election wake held in the New York home of activist Jerry Rubin.

[0] asked Cynthia Powell (1939\u20132015) out, but when Cynthia Powell (1939\u20132015) said that Cynthia Powell (1939\u20132015) was engaged, [0] shouted, \"[0] didn't ask Cynthia Powell (1939\u20132015) to fuckin' marry [0], did [0]?\" Cynthia Powell (1939\u20132015) often accompanied [0] to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's's girlfriend to visit McCartney's.[0] was jealous by nature and eventually grew possessive, often terrifying Cynthia Powell (1939\u20132015) with [0]'s anger.

Brian Epstein was homosexual and closeted, and according to biographer Philip Norman, one of Brian Epstein's reasons for wanting to manage [0] was that Brian Epstein was attracted to John Lennon. Almost as soon as Julian was born, John Lennon went on holiday to Spain with Brian Epstein, which led to speculation about their relationship. When John Lennon was later questioned about their relationship, John Lennon said, \"Well, their relationship was almost a love affair, but not quite. their relationship was never consummated.

According to [0], The two considered going to the studio to make a joke appearance, attempting to claim The two's share of the money, but The two were too tired. [0] summarised [0]'s feelings towards McCartney in an interview three days before his death: \"Throughout [0]'s career, [0]'ve selected to work with\u00a0... only two people: McCartney and Ono\u00a0... selected ain't bad picking.\"Along with [0]'s estrangement from McCartney, [0] always felt a musical competitiveness with McCartney and kept an ear on McCartney's music. During [0]'s career break from 1975 until shortly before his death, according to Fred Seaman, [0] and Ono's assistant at the time, [0] was content to sit back as long as McCartney was producing what [0] saw as mediocre material. [0] took notice when McCartney released \"Coming Up\" in 1980, which was the year Lennon returned to the studio. \"It's driving [0] crackers!\" [0] jokingly complained, because [0] could not get the tune out of [0]'s head. 1980, which was the year Lennon returned to the studio, [0] was asked whether the Beatles' were dreaded enemies or the best of friends, and [0] replied that the Beatles' were neither, and that [0] had not seen any of the Beatles' in a long time. But [0] also said, \"[0] still love the Beatles'. the Beatles' are over, but John, Paul, George and Ono go on.\"", "": ""}, "Political activism": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. Lennon and Ono used Lennon and Ono's honeymoon as a Bed-In for Peace at the Amsterdam Hilton Hotel; a Bed-In for Peace at the Amsterdam Hilton Hotel attracted worldwide media ridicule. During a second Bed-In three months later at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal, [0] wrote and recorded \"Give Peace a Chance\". Released as a single, \"Give Peace a Chance\" was quickly interpreted as an anti-war anthem and sung by a quarter of a million demonstrators against the Vietnam War in Washington,\u00a0DC, on 15 November, the second Vietnam Moratorium Day. In December, Lennon and Ono paid for billboards in 10 cities around the world which declared, in the national language, \"War Is Over! If You Want It\".During the year, Lennon and Ono began to support efforts by the family of James Hanratty to prove James Hanratty's innocence. James Hanratty had been hanged in 1962. According to [0], those who had condemned Hanratty were \"the same people who are running guns to South Africa and killing blacks in the streets\u00a0... The same bastards are in control, The same bastards are running everything, it's the whole bullshit bourgeois scene.\" In London, Lennon and Ono staged a \"Britain Murdered Hanratty\" banner march and a \"Silent Protest For James Hanratty\", and produced a 40-minute documentary on the case. At an appeal hearing more than thirty years later, James Hanratty's conviction was upheld after DNA evidence was found to match, validating those who had condemned Hanratty.Lennon and Ono showed Lennon and Ono's solidarity with the Clydeside UCS workers' work-in of 1971 by sending a bouquet of red roses and a cheque for \u00a35,000. On moving to New York City in August 1971, Lennon and Ono befriended two of the Chicago Seven, Yippie peace activists Jerry Rubin and Abbie Hoffman. Another political activist, John Sinclair, poet and co-founder of the White Panther Party, was serving ten years in prison for selling two joints of marijuana after previous convictions for possession of marijuana. In December at Ann Arbor, Michigan, 15,000 people attended the \"John Sinclair Freedom Rally\", a protest and benefit concert with contributions from [0], Stevie Wonder, Bob Seger, Bobby Seale of the Black Panther Party, and others. Lennon and Ono, backed by David Peel and Jerry Rubin, performed an acoustic set of four songs from Lennon and Ono's forthcoming Some Time in New York City album including \"John Sinclair\", whose lyrics called for John Sinclair's release. The day before a Bed-In for Peace at the Amsterdam Hilton Hotel, the Michigan Senate passed a bill that significantly reduced the penalties for possession of marijuana and four days later John Sinclair was released on an appeal bond. performed was recorded and two of the tracks later appeared on [0] Anthology (1998).Following the Bloody Sunday incident in Northern Ireland in 1972, [0] said that given the choice between the British army and the IRA [0] would side with the IRA. Lennon and Ono wrote two songs protesting British presence and actions in Ireland for Lennon and Ono's Some Time in New York City album: \"The Luck of the Irish\" and \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\". In 2000, David Shayler, a former member of Britain's's domestic security service MI5, suggested that [0] had given money to the IRA, though given was swiftly denied by Ono. Biographer Bill Harry records that following the Bloody Sunday incident in Northern Ireland in 1972, Lennon and Ono financially supported the production of the film The Irish Tapes, a political documentary with an Irish Republican slant. In February 2000 [0]'s cousin Stanley Parkes stated that [0] had given money to the IRA during the 1970s. After the events of the Bloody Sunday incident in Northern Ireland in 1972 Lennon and Ono attended a protest in London while displaying a Red Mole newspaper with the headline \"For the IRA, Against British Imperialism\".Our's society is run by insane people for insane objectives. [0] think Our're being run by maniacs for maniacal ends and [0] think [0]'m liable to be put away as insane for expressing think. think's what's insane about it.\u2014John LennonAccording to FBI surveillance reports, and confirmed by Tariq Ali in 2006, [0] was sympathetic to the International Marxist Group, a Trotskyist group formed in Britain's in 1968. However, FBI considered [0] to have limited effectiveness as a revolutionary, as [0] was \"constantly under the influence of narcotics\".In 1972, [0] contributed a drawing and limerick titled \"Why Make It Sad to Be Gay?\" to Len Richmond and Gary Noguera's The Gay Liberation Book. [0]'s last act of political activism was a statement in support of the striking minority sanitation workers in San Francisco on 5 December 1980. Lennon and Ono planned to join the striking minority sanitation workers in San Francisco's protest on 14 December.", "Deportation attempt": "[0] is our person to focus on. Following the impact of \"Give Peace a Chance\" and \"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\" on the anti-war movement, the Nixon administration heard rumours of [0]'s involvement in a concert to be held in San Diego at the same time as the Republican National Convention and tried to have [0] deported. Nixon believed that [0]'s anti-war activities could cost Nixon Nixon's reelection; Republican Senator Strom Thurmond suggested in a February 1972 memo that \"deportation would be a strategic counter-measure\" against [0]. The next month the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) began deportation proceedings, arguing that [0]'s 1968 misdemeanour conviction for cannabis possession in London had made [0] ineligible for admission to the United States. [0] spent the next three-and-a-half years in and out of deportation hearings until 8 October 1975, when a court of appeals barred the deportation attempt, stating \"the courts will not condone selective deportation based upon secret political grounds\". While the legal battle continued, [0] attended rallies and made television appearances. He and Ono co-hosted The Mike Douglas Show for a week in February 1972, introducing guests such as Jerry Rubin and Bobby Seale to mid-America. In February 1972, Bob Dylan wrote a letter to the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) defending [0], stating:He and Ono add a great voice and drive to the United States's so-called art institution. He and Ono inspire and transcend and stimulate and by doing so, only help others to see pure light and in doing help, put an end to this dull taste of petty commercialism which is being passed off as Artist Art by the overpowering mass media. Hurray for He and Ono. Let He and Ono stay and live here and breathe. the United States's got plenty of room and space. Let He and Ono stay! On 23 March 1973, [0] was ordered to leave the United States within 60 days. Ono, meanwhile, was granted permanent residence. In response, He and Ono held a press conference on 1 April 1973 at the New York City Bar Association, where He and Ono announced the formation of the state of Nutopia; a place with \"no land, no boundaries, no passports, only people\". Waving the white flag of Nutopia (two handkerchiefs), He and Ono asked for political asylum in the United States. a press conference was filmed, and appeared in a 2006 documentary, The U.S. vs. John Lennon.[nb 9] Soon after a press conference, Nixon's involvement in a political scandal came to light, and in June the Watergate hearings began in Washington, DC. the Watergate hearings led to Nixon's resignation 14 months later. In December 1974, when Nixon and members of Nixon's tour entourage visited the White House, Nixon asked Gerald Ford, Nixon's successor, to intercede in the matter. Gerald Ford, Nixon's successor,'s administration showed little interest in continuing the battle against [0], and ordered was overturned in 1975. The following year, [0] received [0]'s green card certifying [0]'s permanent residency, and when Jimmy Carter was inaugurated as president in January 1977, He and Ono attended the Inaugural Ball.", "FBI surveillance and declassified documents": "[0] is our person to focus on. After [0]'s death, historian Jon Wiener filed a Freedom of Information Act request for FBI files that documented FBI's role in the deportation attempt. FBI admitted FBI had 281 pages of files on Lennon, but refused to release most of them 281 pages of files on Lennon on the grounds that most of them contained national security information. In 1983, historian Jon Wiener sued FBI with the help of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California. It took 14 years of litigation to force FBI to release most of them. the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California won a favourable decision in their suit against the FBI in the Ninth Circuit in 1991. The Justice Department appealed a favourable decision in their suit against the FBI in the Ninth Circuit to the Supreme Court in April 1992, but the Supreme Court declined to review the case. In 1997, respecting President Bill Clinton's newly instigated rule that documents should be withheld only if releasing documents would involve \"foreseeable harm\", The Justice Department settled most of the outstanding issues outside court by releasing all but 10 of the contested documents.historian Jon Wiener published the results of historian Jon Wiener's 14-year campaign in January 2000. Gimme Some Truth: 281 pages of files on Lennon contained facsimiles of the documents, including \"lengthy reports by confidential informants detailing the daily lives of anti-war activists, memos to the White House, transcripts of TV shows on which [0] appeared, and a proposal that [0] be arrested by local police on drug charges\". The story is told in the documentary The US vs. John Lennon. The final 10 documents in [0]'s FBI file, which reported on [0]'s ties with London anti-war activists in 1971 and had been withheld as containing \"national security information provided by a foreign government under an explicit promise of confidentiality\", were released in December 2006. all but 10 of the contested documents contained no indication that the British government had regarded [0] as a serious threat; one example of all but 10 of the contested documents was a report that two prominent British leftists had hoped [0] would finance a left-wing bookshop and reading room."}, "Writing": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. Beatles biographer Bill Harry wrote that [0] began drawing and writing creatively at an early age with the encouragement of [0]'s uncle. [0] collected [0]'s stories, poetry, cartoons and caricatures in a Quarry Bank High School exercise book that he called the Daily Howl. The drawings were often of crippled people, and the writings satirical, and throughout a Quarry Bank High School exercise book that he called the Daily Howl was an abundance of wordplay. According to classmate Bill Turner, [0] created a Quarry Bank High School exercise book that he called the Daily Howl to amuse [0]'s best friend and later Quarrymen bandmate Pete Shotton, to whom [0] would show his work before [0] let anyone else see his work. classmate Bill Turner said that [0] \"had an obsession for Wigan Pier. an obsession for Wigan Pier kept cropping up\", and in [0]'s story A Carrot in a Potato Mine, \"a Potato Mine was at the end of Wigan Pier.\" classmate Bill Turner described how one of [0]'s cartoons depicted a bus stop sign annotated with the question, \"Why?\" Above was a flying pancake, and below, \"a blind man wearing glasses leading along a blind dog \u2013 also wearing glasses\".[0]'s love of wordplay and nonsense with a twist found a wider audience when [0] was 24. Beatles biographer Bill Harry writes that In Beatles biographer Bill Harry's Own Write (1964) was published after \"Some journalist who was hanging around the Beatles came to Beatles biographer Bill Harry and Beatles biographer Bill Harry ended up showing Some journalist who was hanging around the Beatles the stuff. They said, 'Write a book' and that's how a book came about\". Like a Quarry Bank High School exercise book that he called the Daily Howl a book contained a mix of formats including short stories, poetry, plays and drawings. One story, \"Good Dog Nigel\", tells the tale of \"a happy dog, urinating on a lamp post, barking, wagging a happy dog's tail \u2013 until a happy dog suddenly hears a message that a happy dog will be killed at three o'clock\". The Times Literary Supplement considered the poems and stories \"remarkable\u00a0... also very funny\u00a0... the nonsense runs on, words and images prompting one another in a chain of pure fantasy\". Book Week reported, \"This is nonsense writing, but one has only to review the literature of nonsense to see how well [0] has brought nonsense writing off. While some of [0]'s homonyms are gratuitous word play, many others have not only double meaning but a double edge.\" [0] was not only surprised by the positive reception, but that a Quarry Bank High School exercise book that he called the Daily Howl was reviewed at all, and suggested that readers \"took a Quarry Bank High School exercise book that he called the Daily Howl more seriously than [0] did [0]. It just began as a laugh for [0].In combination with A Spaniard in the Works (1965), In His Own Write formed the basis of the stage play The [0] Play: In His Own Write, co-adapted by Victor Spinetti and Adrienne Kennedy. After negotiations between [0], Victor Spinetti and the artistic director of the National Theatre, Sir Laurence Olivier, the play opened at The Old Vic in 1968.

A hidden camera secretly filmed the public reaction to his You Are Here art exhibition held at Robert Fraser Gallery in London. For the 1 July opening, Lennon, dressed all in white (as was Ono's), released 365 white balloons into the city sky. Each ballon had attached to Each ballon a small paper card to be mailed back to [0] at Robert Fraser Gallery in London, with the finder's comments.After moving to New York, from 18 April to 12 June 1970, Lennon and Ono presented a series of Fluxus conceptual art events and concerts at Joe Jones's Tone Deaf Music Store called GRAPEFRUIT FLUXBANQUET. Performances included Come Impersonating [0] & Ono's, Grapefruit Banquet and Portrait of [0] as a Young Cloud by Yoko + Everybody. 1968, [0] also made The Complete Ono's Word Poem Game (1970): a conceptual art poem collage that utilized the cut-up (or d\u00e9coup\u00e9) aleatory technique typical of the work of John Cage and many Fluxus artists. The cut-up technique can be traced to at least the Dadaists of the 1920s, but was popularized in the early 1960s by writer William S. Burroughs. For his You Are Here art exhibition held at Robert Fraser Gallery in London, [0] took the portrait photo of himself that was included in the packaging of the 1968 The Beatles LP (aka The White Album) and cut the portrait photo of himself that was included in the packaging of the 1968 The Beatles LP (aka The White Album) into 134 small rectangles.

At 16, [0] played rhythm guitar with the Quarrymen.As [0]'s career progressed, [0] played a variety of electric guitars, predominantly the Rickenbacker 325, Epiphone Casino and Gibson J-160E, and, from the start of [0]'s solo career, the Gibson Les Paul Junior. Double Fantasy producer Jack Douglas claimed that since [0]'s the Beatles' days [0] habitually tuned [0]'s D-string slightly flat, so [0]'s Aunt Mimi could tell which guitar was [0]'s on recordings. Occasionally [0] played a six-string bass guitar, the Fender Bass VI, providing bass on some the Beatles' numbers (\"Back in the U.S.S.R.\", \"The Long and Winding Road\", \"Helter Skelter\") that occupied McCartney with another instrument. [0]'s other instrument of choice was the piano, on which [0] composed many songs, including \"Imagine\", described as [0]'s best-known solo work.
