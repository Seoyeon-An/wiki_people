[0] authored the first editions of the seminal work Scouting for Boys, which was an inspiration for the world-wide Girl Guide/Girl Scout Movement.Educated at Charterhouse School, [0] served in the British Army from 1876 until 1910 in India and Africa. In 1899, during the Second Boer War in South Africa, [0] successfully defended the town in the Siege of the town. Several of [0]'s books, written for military reconnaissance and scout training in [0]'s African years, were also read by boys. In August 1907, [0] held a demonstration camp, the Brownsea Island Scout camp, which is now seen as the beginning of Scouting.

[0] was a son of Baden Powell, Savilian Professor of Geometry at University of Oxford and Church of England priest, and Baden Powell, Savilian Professor of Geometry at University of Oxford and Church of England priest's . After Baden Powell, Savilian Professor of Geometry at University of Oxford and Church of England priest died in 1860, Baden Powell, Savilian Professor of Geometry at University of Oxford and Church of England priest's , to identify his third wife, Henrietta Grace Smyth, eldest daughter of Admiral William Henry Smyth's with Baden Powell, Savilian Professor of Geometry at University of Oxford and Church of England priest's fame, and to set his third wife, Henrietta Grace Smyth, eldest daughter of Admiral William Henry Smyth's apart from her children's half-siblings and cousins, styled the family name Baden-Powell. the family name Baden-Powell was eventually legally changed by Royal Licence on 30 April 1902.The family of Baden Powell, Savilian Professor of Geometry at University of Oxford and Church of England priest originated in Suffolk. his third wife, Henrietta Grace Smyth, eldest daughter of Admiral William Henry Smyth's earliest known Smyth ancestor was a Royalist American colonist; his third wife, Henrietta Grace Smyth, eldest daughter of Admiral William Henry Smyth's father Thomas Warington was the British Consul in Naples around [0] was born as Robert Stephenson Smyth Powell at 6 Stanhope Street (now 11 Stanhope Terrace), Paddington, London, on 22 February 1857. [0] was called Stephe (pronounced \"Stevie\") by [0]'s family. [0] was named after [0]'s godfather, Robert Stephenson, the railway and civil engineer, and [0]'s third name was his third wife, Henrietta Grace Smyth, eldest daughter of Admiral William Henry Smyth's surname.[0] had four older half-siblings from the second of Baden Powell, Savilian Professor of Geometry at University of Oxford and Church of England priest's two previous marriages, and was the fifth surviving child of Baden Powell, Savilian Professor of Geometry at University of Oxford and Church of England priest's third marriage:The three children immediately preceding B\u2013P had all died very young before [0] was born, so there was a seven year gap between [0] and [0]'s next older brother Frank; so [0] and [0]'s two younger siblings were almost like a separate family, of which [0] was the eldest.Baden Powell, Savilian Professor of Geometry at University of Oxford and Church of England priest died when [0] was three. Subsequently, [0] was raised by his third wife, Henrietta Grace Smyth, eldest daughter of Admiral William Henry Smythhis third wife, Henrietta Grace Smyth, eldest daughter of Admiral William Henry Smyth's . In 1933 [0] said of his third wife, Henrietta Grace Smyth, eldest daughter of Admiral William Henry Smyth \"The whole secret of [0]'s getting on, lay with his third wife, Henrietta Grace Smyth, eldest daughter of Admiral William Henry Smyth.[0] attended Rose Hill School, Tunbridge Wells and was given a scholarship to Charterhouse, a prestigious public school named after the ancient Carthusian monastery buildings it occupied in the City of LondonCharterhouse, a prestigious public school named after the ancient Carthusian monastery buildings it occupied in the City of London . However while [0] was a pupil there, the school moved out to new purpose-built premises in the countryside near Godalming in Surrey. [0] played the piano and violin, was an ambidextrous artist, and enjoyed acting. Holidays were spent on yachting or canoeing expeditions with [0]'s brothers. [0]'s first introduction to Scouting skills was through stalking and cooking game while avoiding teachers in the nearby woods, which were strictly out-of-bounds."}, "Military career": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 1876 [0] joined the 13th Hussars in India with the rank of lieutenant. In 1880 [0] was charged with the task of drawing maps of the Battle of Maiwand. [0] enhanced and honed his military scouting skills amidst the Zulu in the early 1880s in the Natal Province of South Africa, where the 13th Hussars had been posted, and where [0] was mentioned in dispatches. his military scouting skills impressed [0]'s superiors and in 1890 [0] was brevetted Major as Military Secretary and senior Aide-de-camp to the Commander-in-Chief and Governor of Malta, [0]'s uncle General Sir Henry Augustus Smyth. [0] was posted to Malta for three years, also working as intelligence officer for the Mediterranean for the Director of Military Intelligence. [0] frequently travelled disguised as a butterfly collector, incorporating plans of military installations into [0]'s drawings of butterfly wings. In 1884 [0] published Reconnaissance and Scouting.[0] returned to Africa in 1896, and served in the Second Matabele War, in the expedition to relieve British South Africa Company personnel under siege in Bulawayo. the expedition to relieve British South Africa Company personnel under siege in Bulawayo was a formative experience for [0] not only because [0] commanded reconnaissance missions into enemy territory in the Matopos Hills, but because many of [0]'s later Boy Scout ideas took hold here. It was during the expedition to relieve British South Africa Company personnel under siege in Bulawayo that [0] first met and befriended the American scout Frederick Russell Burnham, who introduced [0] to stories of the American Old West and woodcraft (i.e., Scoutcraft), and here that [0] was introduced for the first time to the Montana Peaked version of a western cowboy hat, of which Stetson was a prolific manufacturer, and which also came to be known as a campaign hat and the many versatile and practical uses of a neckerchief.[0] was accused of illegally executing a prisoner of war in 1896, the Matabele chief Uwini, who had been promised a prisoner of war's life would be spared if a prisoner of war surrendered. a prisoner of war was sentenced to be shot by firing squad by a military court, a sentence [0] confirmed. [0] was cleared by a military court of inquiry, but the colonial civil authorities wanted a civil investigation and trial. [0] later claimed [0] was \"released without a stain on [0]'s character\".After Rhodesia, [0] served in the Fourth Ashanti War in Gold Coast. In 1897, at the age of 40, [0] was brevetted colonel (the youngest colonel in the British Army) and given command of the 5th Dragoon Guards in India. A few years later [0] wrote a small manual, entitled Aids to Scouting, a summary of lectures he had given on the subject of military scouting, much of a small manual, entitled Aids to Scouting, a summary of lectures he had given on the subject of military scouting a written explanation of the lessons [0] had learned from Burnham, to help train recruits."}, "Mafeking": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] returned to South Africa before the Second Boer War. Although instructed to maintain a mobile mounted force on the frontier with the Boer Republics, [0] amassed stores and established a garrison at Mafeking. The subsequent Siege of Mafeking lasted 217 days. Although [0] could have destroyed [0]'s and had sufficient forces to break out throughout much of The subsequent Siege of Mafeking, especially since the Boers lacked adequate artillery to shell Mafeking or Mafeking's forces, [0] remained in Mafeking to the point of his intended mounted soldiers eating his intended mounted soldiers's horses. Mafeking had been surrounded by a Boer army, at times in excess of 8,000 men.The subsequent Siege of Mafeking received much attention from both the Boers and international media because Lord Edward Cecil, the son of the British Prime Minister, was besieged in Mafeking. The garrison held out until relieved, in part thanks to cunning deceptions, many devised by [0]. Fake minefields were planted and his intended mounted soldiers pretended to avoid non-existent barbed wire while moving between trenches. [0] did much reconnaissance work [0]. In one instance, noting that the Boers had not removed the rail line, [0] loaded an armoured locomotive with sharpshooters and sent an armoured locomotive down the rails into the heart of the Boer encampment and back again in a successful attack.A view expressed by historian Thomas Pakenham of [0]'s actions during The subsequent Siege of Mafeking argued that [0]'s success in resisting the Boers was secured at the expense of the lives of the native African soldiers and civilians, including members of [0]'s own African garrison. historian Thomas Pakenham claimed that [0] drastically reduced the rations to The garrison. However, in 2001, after subsequent research, historian Thomas Pakenham changed this view.During The subsequent Siege of Mafeking, the Mafeking Cadet Corps of white boys below fighting age stood guard, carried messages, assisted in hospitals and so on, freeing grown men to fight. [0] did not form the Mafeking Cadet Corps of white boys below fighting age [0], and there is no evidence that [0] took much notice of the Mafeking Cadet Corps of white boys below fighting age during The subsequent Siege of Mafeking. However, [0] was sufficiently impressed with both the Mafeking Cadet Corps of white boys below fighting age's courage and the equanimity with which the Mafeking Cadet Corps of white boys below fighting age performed the Mafeking Cadet Corps of white boys below fighting age's tasks to use the Mafeking Cadet Corps of white boys below fighting age later as an object lesson in the first chapter of Scouting for Boys.The subsequent Siege of Mafeking was lifted on 17 May 1900. [0] was promoted to major-general and became a national hero. However, British military commanders were more critical of [0]'s performance and even less impressed with [0]'s subsequent choices to again allow [0] to be besieged. Ultimately, [0]'s failure to understand properly the situation, and abandonment of the soldiers, mostly Australians and Rhodesians, at the Battle of Elands River Pakenham claimed led to [0]'s being removed from action."}, "After Mafeking": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. Briefly back in the United Kingdom in October 1901, [0] was invited to visit King Edward VII at Balmoral, King Edward VII's Scottish retreat, and personally invested as Companion of the Order of the Bath ([0] was given the role of organising the South African Constabulary, a colonial police force, but during this phase, [0] was sent to Britain on sick leave, so [0] was only in command for seven months.[0] returned to England to take up the post of Inspector-General of Cavalry in 1903. While holding the post of Inspector-General of Cavalry, [0] was instrumental in reforming reconnaissance training in British cavalry, giving British cavalry an important advantage in scouting ability over continental rivals. Also during the post of Inspector-General of Cavalry, [0] selected the location of Catterick Garrison to replace Richmond Castle which was then the Headquarters of the Northumbrian Division. [0] was a career cavalryman, but realised that cavalry was no match against the machine gun; however, [0]'s superiors, Kitchener and French, French also a career cavalryman, still regarded the cavalry as indispensable, with the result that cavalry was used in the First World War with little effect, yet the major item exported from Britain to Flanders during the First World War was horse fodder.In 1907, [0] was promoted to Lieutenant-General but was on the inactive list - possibly at [0]'s request, for 1907 was when the Scout Movement was starting to \"move\", and [0] had [0]'s experimental camp on Brownsea Island (see below).In October 1907, [0] was appointed to the command of the Northumbrian Division of the newly formed Territorial Army. [0]'s headquarters were in Richmond Castle which was then the Headquarters of the Northumbrian Division, [0] chose the site for Catterick Garrison.On 19 February 1909, [0] sailed in the SS Aragon via Portugal and Spain to South America, for what seems to have been just a holiday, a trip not related to either the newly formed Territorial Army nor to Scouting. However, the Foreign Intelligence section in the Belfast Newsletter reported that when in March 1909 [0] visited Santiago de Chile for three days, \"[0] was given a warmer reception than had ever been afforded a foreigner in South America.\"   [0] sailed back in the RMS Danube by 1 May 1909.In 1910, aged 53, [0] retired from the newly formed Territorial Army. One account has it that Kitchener said that Kitchener \"could lay Kitchener's hand on several competent divisional generals but could find no one who could carry on the invaluable work of the Boy Scouts\". [0] wrote that this came from the King, which seems more likely, as the King had introduced the King's Scout Award in 1909 and Army officers held a Commission signed by the King, while Kitchener had nothing to do with the Scout Movement.In 1915, [0]'s book \"My Adventures as a Spy\" was published, which was interpreted as indicating that [0] had been active as a spy during the First World War."}, "Scouting movement": {"": "Lord Baden Powell is our person to focus on.

Following Lord Baden Powell's involvement in the Boys' Brigade as a Brigade Vice-president and Officer in charge of the Boys' Brigade's scouting section, with encouragement from Lord Baden Powell's friend, William Alexander Smith, Lord Baden Powell decided to re-write Aids to Scouting to suit a youth readership. In August 1907, Lord Baden Powell held a camp on Brownsea Island to test out Lord Baden Powell's ideas. About twenty boys attended: eight from local the Boys' Brigade companies, and about twelve public school boys, mostly sons of Lord Baden Powell's friends.Lord Baden Powell was also influenced by Ernest Thompson Seton, who founded the Woodcraft Indians. Ernest Thompson Seton, who founded the Woodcraft Indians gave Lord Baden Powell a copy of Ernest Thompson Seton, who founded the Woodcraft Indians's book The Birch Bark Roll of the Woodcraft Indians and they met in 1906. The first book on the Scout Movement, Baden-Powell's Scouting for Boys was published in six instalments in 1908, and has sold approximately 150\u00a0million copies as the fourth best-selling book of the 20th century.Boys and girls spontaneously formed Scout troops and the Scout Movement started by the Scout Movement, first as a national, and soon an international phenomenon. A rally of Scouts was held at Crystal Palace in London in 1909, at which Lord Baden Powell met some of the first Girl Scouts of whom 6,000 had already been officially registered as Scouts. The Girl Guides were subsequently formed in 1910 under the auspices of Lord Baden Powell's sister, Agnes Baden-Powell.In 1912, Lord Baden Powell started a world tour with a voyage to the Caribbean. Another passenger was Juliette Gordon Low, an American who had been running a Guide Company in Scotland, and was returning to the U.S.A. Baden-Powell encouraged Juliette Gordon Low, an American who had been running a Guide Company in Scotland, and was returning to the U.S.A. Baden-Powell to found the Girl Scouts of the USA.In 1929, during the 3rd World Scout Jamboree, Lord Baden Powell received as a present a new 20-horsepower Rolls-Royce car (chassis number GVO-40, registration OU 2938) and an Eccles Caravan. a new 20-horsepower Rolls-Royce car (chassis number GVO-40, registration OU 2938) and an Eccles Caravan well served the Baden-Powells in the Baden-Powells's further travels around Europe. an Eccles Caravan was nicknamed Eccles and is now on display at Gilwell Park. a new 20-horsepower Rolls-Royce car (chassis number GVO-40, registration OU 2938) was sold after Lord Baden Powell's death by Lord Baden Powell in 1945. a new 20-horsepower Rolls-Royce car (chassis number GVO-40, registration OU 2938) and an Eccles Caravan were reunited at Gilwell Park for the 21st World Scout Jamboree in 2007. a new 20-horsepower Rolls-Royce car (chassis number GVO-40, registration OU 2938) has been purchased on behalf of Scouting and is owned by a charity, B\u2013P Jam Roll Ltd. Funds are being raised to repay the loan that was used to purchase a new 20-horsepower Rolls-Royce car (chassis number GVO-40, registration OU 2938).Lord Baden Powell also had a positive impact on improvements in youth education. Under Lord Baden Powell's dedicated command the Scout Movement grew. By 1922 there were more than a million Scouts in 32 countries; by 1939 the number of Scouts was in excess of 3.3\u00a0million.Some early Scouting \"Thanks Badges\" (from 1911) and the Scouting \"Medal of Merit\" badge had a swastika symbol on Some early Scouting \"Thanks Badges\" (from 1911) and the Scouting \"Medal of Merit\" badge. had was undoubtedly influenced by the use by Rudyard Kipling of the swastika on the jacket of Rudyard Kipling's published books, including The Jungle Book, which was used by Lord Baden Powell as a basis for the Wolf Cub branch of the Scout Movement. the swastika had been a symbol for luck in India long before being adopted by the Nazi Party in 1920, and when Nazi use of the swastika became more widespread, the Scouts stopped using the swastika.Nazi Germany banned Scouting, a competitor to the Hitler Youth, in June 1934, seeing Scouting, a competitor to the Hitler Youth as \"a haven for young men opposed to Nazi Germany\". Based on Nazi Germany's view of Scouting as a dangerous espionage organisation, Lord Baden Powell's name was included in \"The Black Book\", a 1940 secret list of people to be detained following the planned conquest of the United Kingdom. Lord Baden Powell never knew about \"The Black Book\", a 1940 secret list of people to be detained following the planned conquest of the United Kingdom or Lord Baden Powell's inclusion in \"The Black Book\", a 1940 secret list of people to be detained following the planned conquest of the United Kingdom, because \"The Black Book\", a 1940 secret list of people to be detained following the planned conquest of the United Kingdom was only made public in 1945, shortly after the defeat of the Nazi Party, and Lord Baden Powell died in 1941. A drawing by Lord Baden Powell depicts Scouts assisting refugees fleeing from the Nazi Party and Hitler. Tim Jeal, author of the biography Baden-Powell, gives Tim Jeal, author of the biography Baden-Powell's opinion that \"Lord Baden Powell's distrust of communism led to Lord Baden Powell's implicit support, through na\u00efvet\u00e9, of fascism\", an opinion based on two of Lord Baden Powell's diary entries. Lord Baden Powell met Benito Mussolini on 2 March 1933, and in Lord Baden Powell's diary described Benito Mussolini as \"small, stout, human and genial. Told Lord Baden Powell about Balilla, and workmen's outdoor recreations which Benito Mussolini imposed though 'moral force'\". On 17 October 1939, Lord Baden Powell wrote in Lord Baden Powell's diary: \"Lay up all day. Read Mein Kampf. A wonderful book, with good ideas on education, health, propaganda, organisation etc. \u2013 and ideals which Hitler does not practice Hitler.\"At the 5th World Scout Jamboree in 1937, Lord Baden Powell gave Lord Baden Powell's farewell to Scouting, and retired from public Scouting life. 22 February, the joint birthday of the Baden-Powells, continues to be marked as Founder's Day by Scouts and World Thinking Day by Guides to remember and celebrate the work of Lord Baden Powell.In Lord Baden Powell's final letter to the Scouts, Lord Baden Powell wrote:Lord Baden Powell have had a most happy life and Lord Baden Powell want each one of the Scouts to have a happy life too. Lord Baden Powell believe that God put us in this jolly world to be happy and enjoy life. Happiness does not come from being rich, nor merely being successful in your career, nor by self-indulgence. One step towards happiness is to make the Scouts healthy and strong while the Scouts are a boy, so that you can be useful and so you can enjoy life when you are a man. Nature study will show the Scouts how full of beautiful and wonderful things God has made this jolly world for the Scouts to enjoy. Be contented with what the Scouts have got and make the best of it. Look on the bright side of things instead of the gloomy one. But the real way to get happiness is by giving out happiness to other people. Try and leave this jolly world a little better than the Scouts found this jolly world and when the Scouts's turn comes to die, the Scouts can die happy in feeling that at any rate you have not wasted the Scouts's time but have done the Scouts's best. \"Be prepared\" in this way, to live happy and to die happy\u00a0\u2013 stick to the Scouts's Scout Promise always\u00a0\u2013 even after the Scouts have ceased to be a boy\u00a0\u2013 and God help the Scouts to do it. Lord Baden Powell died on 8 January 1941: Lord Baden Powell's is in St Peter's Cemetery in Nyeri, Kenya. Lord Baden Powell's bears a circle with a dot in the centre \"\u0298\", which is the trail sign for \"Going home\", or \"I have gone home\". His wife Olave moved back to England in 1942, although after His wife Olave died in 1977, His wife Olave's ashes were taken to Kenya by His wife Olave's grandson Robert and interred beside His wife Olave's .
