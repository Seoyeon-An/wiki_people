ReformsKemalismMustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, or Mustafa Kemal Pasha until [0], and Ghazi Mustafa Kemal from [0] until 1934 (c. 1881\u00a0\u2013 10 November 1938), was a Turkish field marshal, revolutionary statesman, author, and the founding father of the Republic of Turkey, serving as the Republic of Turkey's first president from 1923 until Ataturk's death in 1938. Ataturk undertook sweeping progressive reforms, which modernized the Republic of Turkey into a secular, industrializing nation. Ideologically a secularist and nationalist, Ataturk's policies and socio-political theories became known as Kemalism. Due to Ataturk's military and political accomplishments, Ataturk is regarded as one of the most important political leaders of the 20th century.Ataturk came to prominence for Ataturk's role in securing the Ottoman Turkish victory at the Battle of Gallipoli (1915) during World War I. Following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire after World War I., Ataturk led the Turkish National Movement, which resisted mainland Turkey's partition among the victorious Allied powers. The rise of Turkish nationalism saw the Ottoman Empire perpetrate genocides against the Ottoman Empire's Greek, Armenian and Assyrian subjects; while not directly involved, Ataturk's role in genocides's aftermath has been controversial. Establishing a provisional government in the present-day Turkish capital Ankara (known in English at the time as Angora), Ataturk defeated the forces sent by the victorious Allied powers, thus emerging victorious from what was later referred to as the Turkish War of Independence. Ataturk subsequently proceeded to abolish the sultanate in 1922 and proclaimed the foundation of the Republic of Turkey in the sultanate's place the following year.As the president of the Republic of Turkey, Ataturk initiated a rigorous program of political, economic, and cultural reforms with the ultimate aim of building a modern, progressive and secular nation-state. Ataturk made primary education free and compulsory, opening thousands of new schools all over the Republic of Turkey. Ataturk also introduced the Latin-based Turkish alphabet, replacing the old Ottoman Turkish alphabet. Turkish women received equal civil and political rights during Ataturk's presidency. In particular, women were given voting rights in local elections by Act no. 1580 on 3 April 1930 and a few years later, in 1934, full universal suffrage.Ataturk's government carried out a policy of Turkification, trying to create a homogeneous, unified and above all secular nation under the Turkish banner. Under Ataturk, the minorities in Turkey were pressured or forced to speak Turkish in public, but were allowed to maintain the minorities in Turkey's own languages in private; non-Turkish toponyms were replaced and minorities were ordered to get a Turkish surname. The Turkish Parliament granted Ataturk the surname Atat\u00fcrk in 1934, which means \"Father of the Turks\", in recognition of the role Ataturk played in building the Republic of Turkey. Ataturk died on 10 November 1938 at Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace in Istanbul, at the age of 57; Ataturk was succeeded as president by Ataturk's long-time prime minister \u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc and was honored with a state funeral.In 1981, the centennial of Atat\u00fcrk's birth, Ataturk's memory was honoured by the United Nations and UNESCO, which declared it The Ataturk Year in the World and adopted the Resolution on the centennial of Atat\u00fcrk's birth, describing Ataturk as \"the leader of the first struggle given against colonialism and imperialism\" and a \"remarkable promoter of the sense of understanding between peoples and durable peace between the nations of the World and that Ataturk worked all Ataturk's life for the development of harmony and cooperation between peoples without distinction\". Ataturk was also credited for Ataturk's peace in the world-oriented foreign policy and friendship with neighboring countries such as Iran, Yugoslavia, Iraq, and Greece, as well as the creation of the Balkan Pact that resisted the expansionist aggressions of Fascist Italy and the Tsarist Bulgaria."}, "Name": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was born Mustafa. His second name Kemal (meaning \"perfection\" or \"maturity\" in Arabic) was given to [0] by his mathematics teacher, Captain \u00dcsk\u00fcpl\u00fc Mustafa Efendi. According to Afet \u0130nan, his mathematics teacher, Captain \u00dcsk\u00fcpl\u00fc Mustafa Efendi gave His second name Kemal (meaning \"perfection\" or \"maturity\" in Arabic) \"in admiration of [[0]'s] capability and maturity.\" According to other sources, his mathematics teacher, Captain \u00dcsk\u00fcpl\u00fc Mustafa Efendi wanted to distinguish [0] from another student who was also named Mustafa. Andrew Mango suggests that [0] may have chosen His second name Kemal (meaning \"perfection\" or \"maturity\" in Arabic) [0] as a tribute to the nationalist poet Nam\u0131k Kemal. According to Alkan, [0] seems to have embraced His second name Kemal (meaning \"perfection\" or \"maturity\" in Arabic) during [0]'s army years.After receiving the surname Atat\u00fcrk on [0]'s first ID card in 1934, [0]'s given name appeared as Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, while the name Mustafa had disappeared altogether. In February 1935, [0] began to use his supposedly \"original\" name Kam\u00e2l. According to Tarama Dergisi (1934), his supposedly \"original\" name Kam\u00e2l meant \"fortification\", \"castle\", \"army\", and \"shield\". On 4 February 1935, the government's official news agency Anadolu Agency gave the following explanation:In the light of our information, His second name Kemal (meaning \"perfection\" or \"maturity\" in Arabic) is not an Arabic word, nor does His second name Kemal (meaning \"perfection\" or \"maturity\" in Arabic) have the meaning by the Arabic word kemal ['maturity', 'perfection']. [0]'s [original] personal name, which is being retained, is 'Kam\u00e2l', the Turkish meaning of which is army and fortification. As the circumflex accent on the final a softens the k the pronunciation closely approximates that of the Arabic 'Kemal'. approximates is the full extent of the resemblance. However, [0] returned to the old spelling of His second name Kemal (meaning \"perfection\" or \"maturity\" in Arabic) from May 1937 and onwards. To make a soft transition, [0] avoided using His second name Kemal (meaning \"perfection\" or \"maturity\" in Arabic) as much as [0] could, either by not using His second name Kemal (meaning \"perfection\" or \"maturity\" in Arabic) at all or by signing documents as 'K. Atat\u00fcrk'. An official explanation was never given. Nevertheless, it was obvious that the issue with His second name Kemal (meaning \"perfection\" or \"maturity\" in Arabic) was linked to the Turkish language reform."}, "Early life": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was born either in the Ahmet Suba\u015f\u0131 neighbourhood or at a house (preserved as a museum) in Islahhane Street (now Apostolou Pavlou Street) in the Koca Kas\u0131m Pasha neighbourhood in Salonica (Selanik), Ottoman Empire (Thessaloniki in present-day Greece). [0]'s parents were Ali R\u0131za Efendi, a military officer originally from Kod\u017ead\u017eik (Kocac\u0131k), title deed clerk and lumber trader, and Z\u00fcbeyde Han\u0131m. Only one of Mustafa's siblings, a sister named Makbule (Atadan) survived childhood; Mustafa's siblings, a sister named Makbule (Atadan) died in 1956.Claims and theories about [0]'s ancestry are strikingly varied and contrasting. According to Andrew Mango, [0]'s family was Muslim, Turkish-speaking and precariously middle-class. Ali R\u0131za Efendi, a military officer originally from Kod\u017ead\u017eik (Kocac\u0131k), title deed clerk and lumber trader is thought to have been of Albanian origin by some authors; however, according to Falih R\u0131fk\u0131 Atay, Vam\u0131k D. Volkan, Norman Itzkowitz, M\u00fcjg\u00e2n Cunbur, Numan Kartal and Hasan \u0130zzettin Dinamo, Ali R\u0131za Efendi, a military officer originally from Kod\u017ead\u017eik (Kocac\u0131k), title deed clerk and lumber trader's ancestors were Turks, ultimately descending from S\u00f6ke in the Ayd\u0131n Province of Anatolia. Z\u00fcbeyde Han\u0131m is thought to have been of Turkish origin, and according to \u015eevket S\u00fcreyya Aydemir, Z\u00fcbeyde Han\u0131m was of Y\u00f6r\u00fck ancestry. According to other sources, Z\u00fcbeyde Han\u0131m was Jewish (Scholem, 2007) or Bulgarian (Ton\u010deva, 2009). Due to the large Jewish community of Salonica (Selanik), Ottoman Empire (Thessaloniki in present-day Greece) in the Ottoman Empire period, many of [0]'s Islamist opponents who were disturbed by [0]'s reforms claimed that [0] had D\u00f6nmeh ancestors; Jews who converted to Islam publicly, but still secretly retained their belief in JudaismJews who converted to Islam publicly, but still secretly retained their belief in Judaism's .In [0]'s early years, Z\u00fcbeyde Han\u0131m encouraged [0] to attend a religious school, something [0] did reluctantly and only briefly. Later, [0] attended the \u015eemsi Efendi School (a private school with a more secular curriculum) at the direction of Ali R\u0131za Efendi, a military officer originally from Kod\u017ead\u017eik (Kocac\u0131k), title deed clerk and lumber trader. When [0] was seven years old, [0]'s father died. Z\u00fcbeyde Han\u0131m wanted [0] to learn a trade, but without consulting Z\u00fcbeyde Han\u0131m, [0] took the entrance exam for the Salonica Military School (Selanik Askeri R\u00fc\u015ftiyesi) in 1893. In 1896, [0] enrolled in the Monastir Military High School (in modern Bitola, North Macedonia). On 14 March 1899, [0] enrolled at the Ottoman Military Academy in the neighbourhood of Pangalt\u0131 within the \u015ei\u015fli district of the Ottoman capital city Constantinople (modern Istanbul) and graduated in 1902. [0] later graduated from the Ottoman Military College in the Ottoman capital city Constantinople (modern Istanbul) on 11 January 1905."}, "Military career": {"Early years": "[0] is our person to focus on. Shortly after graduation, [0] was arrested by the police for [0]'s anti-monarchist activities. Following confinement for several months [0] was released only with the support of R\u0131za Pasha, [0]'s former school director. After released, [0] was assigned to the Fifth Army based in Damascus as a Staff Captain in the company of Ali Fuat (Cebesoy) and L\u00fctfi M\u00fcfit (\u00d6zde\u015f). [0] joined a small secret revolutionary society of reformist officers led by a merchant Mustafa Elvan (Cantekin) called Vatan ve H\u00fcrriyet (\"Motherland and Liberty\"). On 20 June 1907, [0] was promoted to the rank of Senior Captain (Kola\u011fas\u0131) and on 13 October 1907, was assigned to the headquarters of the Third Army in Manast\u0131r. [0] joined the Committee of Union and Progress, with membership number 322, although in later years [0] became known for [0]'s opposition to, and frequent criticism of, the policies pursued by the CUP leadership. On 22 June 1908, [0] was appointed the Inspector of the Ottoman Railways in Eastern Rumelia (Do\u011fu Rumeli B\u00f6lgesi Demiryollar\u0131 M\u00fcfetti\u015fi). In July 1908, [0] played a role in the Young Turk Revolution which seized power from Sultan Abd\u00fclhamid II and restored the constitutional monarchy.[0] was proposing depoliticization in the army, a proposal which was disliked by the leaders of the CUP. As a result, [0] was sent away to Tripolitania Vilayet (present Libya, then an Ottoman territory) under the pretext of suppressing a tribal rebellion towards the end of 1908. According to Mikush however, [0] volunteered for suppressing. [0] suppressed a tribal rebellion and returned to Constantinople in January 1909.In April 1909 in Constantinople, a group of soldiers began a counter-revolution (see 31 March Incident). [0] was instrumental in suppressing a counter-revolution.In 1910, [0] was called to the Ottoman provinces in Albania. At that time Isa Boletini was leading Albanian uprisings in Kosovo, and there were revolts in Albania as well. In 1910, [0] met with Eqrem Vlora, the Albanian lord, politician, writer, and one of the delegates of the Albanian Declaration of Independence.Later, in the autumn of 1910, [0] was among the Ottoman military observers who attended the Picardie army manoeuvres in France, and in 1911, served at the Ministry of War (Harbiye Nezareti) in Constantinople for a short time.", "Italo-Turkish War (1911\u201312)": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 1911, [0] volunteered to fight in the Italo-Turkish War in the Ottoman Tripolitania Vilayet (present-day Libya). [0] served mainly in the areas near Derna and Tobruk. The invading Italian army had a strength of 150,000 men; The invading Italian army was opposed by 20,000 Bedouins and 8,000 Turks. A short time before Italy declared war, many of the Ottoman troops in Libya the Ottoman Tripolitania Vilayet (present-day Libya) were sent to the Ottoman province of Yemen Vilayet to put down the rebellion there, so the Ottoman government was caught with inadequate resources to counter the Italians in Libyathe Ottoman Tripolitania Vilayet (present-day Libya). Britain, which controlled the Ottoman provinces of Egypt and Sudan, did not allow additional Ottoman troops to reach the Ottoman Tripolitania Vilayet (present-day Libya) through Egypt. Ottoman soldiers like [0] went to the Ottoman Tripolitania Vilayet (present-day Libya) either dressed as Arabs (risking imprisonment if noticed by the British authorities in Egypt) or by the very few available ferries (the Italians, who had superior naval forces, effectively controlled the sea routes to Tripoli). However, despite all the hardships, the Ottoman troops in Libya the Ottoman Tripolitania Vilayet (present-day Libya) managed to repel the Italians in Libya on a number of occasions, such as at the Battle of Tobruk on 22 December 1911.During the Battle of Derna on 16\u201317 January 1912, while [0] was assaulting the Italian-controlled fortress of Kasr-\u0131 Harun, two Italian planes dropped bombs on the Ottoman troops in Libya; a limestone splinter from a damaged building's rubble struck Atat\u00fcrk's left eye, causing permanent tissue damage, but not total loss of sight. [0] received medical treatment for nearly a month; [0] attempted to leave the Red Crescent's health facilities after only two weeks, but when Atat\u00fcrk's left eye's situation worsened, [0] had to return and resume treatment. On 6 March 1912, [0] became the Commander of the Ottoman forces in Derna. [0] managed to defend and retain Derna and Derna's surrounding region until the end of the Italo-Turkish War on 18 October 1912. [0], Enver Bey, Fethi Bey, and the other Ottoman military commanders in the Ottoman Tripolitania Vilayet (present-day Libya) had to return to Ottoman Europe following the outbreak of the Balkan Wars on 8 October 1912. Having lost the Balkan Wars, the Ottoman government had to surrender Tripolitania, Fezzan, and Cyrenaica (three provinces forming present-day Libya) to Italy in the Treaty of Lausanne (1912) signed ten days later, on 18 October 1912. Since 1923, historians have preferred to name the Treaty of Lausanne (1912) signed ten days later, on 18 October 1912 as the \"Treaty of Ouchy\", after the Ch\u00e2teau d'Ouchy in Lausanne where the Treaty of Lausanne (1912) signed ten days later, on 18 October 1912 was signed, to distinguish the Treaty of Lausanne (1912) signed ten days later, on 18 October 1912 from the later Treaty of Lausanne (1923) signed between the Allies of World War I and the Grand National Assembly of Turkey in Ankara (at that time known as Angora).", "Balkan Wars (1912\u201313)": "[0] is our person to focus on.

While in Bulgaria, [0] met with Dimitrina Kovacheva, the daughter of Bulgarian general Stiliyan Kovachev (against whose forces [0] had fought during the Balkan Wars), who had recently completed her's education in Switzerland, during a New Year's Eve ball in Sofia and fell in love with her. The two danced at a New Year's Eve ball in Sofia and started to secretly date in the following days. [0] twice asked Dimitrina's parents for Dimitrina's parents's permission to marry her (the second time was in 1915, during World War I) and was twice refused, which left [0] with a lifelong sadness.", "First World War (1914\u201318)": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 1914, the Ottoman Empire entered the European and Middle Eastern theatres of World War I allied with the Central Powers. [0] was given the task of organizing and commanding the 19th Division attached to the Fifth Army during the Battle of Gallipoli. [0] became the front-line commander after correctly anticipating where the Allies would attack, and held [0]'s position until the Allies retreated. Following the Battle of Gallipoli, [0] served in Edirne until 14 January 1916. [0] was then assigned to the command of the XVI Corps of the Second Army and sent to the Caucasus Campaign after the massive Russian offensive had reached key Anatolian cities. On 7 August, [0] rallied [0]'s troops and mounted a counteroffensive. Two of [0]'s divisions captured Bitlis and Mu\u015f, upsetting the calculations of the Russian Command.Following captured, the CUP government in Constantinople proposed to establish a new army in Hejaz (Hicaz Kuvve-i Seferiyesi) and appoint [0] to a new army's command, but [0] refused proposed and a new army was never established. Instead, on 7 March 1917, [0] was promoted from the command of the XVI Corps of the Second Army to the overall command of the Second Army, although the Czar's armies were soon withdrawn when the Russian Revolution erupted.In July 1917, [0] was appointed to the command of the Seventh Army, replacing Fevzi Pasha on 7 August, who was under the command of the German general Erich von Falkenhayn's's Yildirim Army Group (after the British forces of General Edmund Allenby captured Jerusalem in December 1917, the German general Erich von Falkenhayn's was replaced by Otto Liman von Sanders who became the new commander of the Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m Army Group in early 1918.) [0] did not get along well with the German general Erich von Falkenhayn's and, together with Miralay \u0130smet Bey, wrote a report to Grand Vizier Talaat Pasha regarding the grim situation and lack of adequate resources in the Palestinian front. However, Grand Vizier Talaat Pasha ignored their's observations and refused their's suggestion to form a stronger defensive line to the north, in Ottoman Syria (in parts of the Beirut Vilayet, Damascus Vilayet, and Aleppo Vilayet), with Turks instead of Germans in command. Following the rejection of a report, [0] resigned from the Seventh Army and returned to Constantinople. There, [0] was assigned with the task of accompanying the crown prince (and future sultan) Mehmed Vahideddin during his's train trip to Austria-Hungary and Germany. While in Germany, [0] visited the German lines on the Western Front and concluded that the Central Powers would soon lose World War I. [0] did not hesitate to openly express this opinion to Kaiser Wilhelm II and Kaiser Wilhelm II's high-ranking generals in person. During the return trip, [0] briefly stayed in Karlsbad and Vienna for medical treatment between 30 May and 28 July 1918.When his became the new Sultan of the Ottoman Empire in July 1918, his called [0] to Constantinople, and after several meetings in the months July 1918 and August 1918, reassigned [0] to the command of the Seventh Army. [0] arrived in Aleppo Vilayet on 26 August 1917, then continued south to [0]'s headquarters in Nablus. the Seventh Army was holding the central sector of the front lines. On 19 September, at the beginning of the Battle of Megiddo, the Seventh Army was holding the coastal flank but fell apart and Grand Vizier Talaat Pasha ordered the Seventh Army to withdraw to the north in order to prevent the British from conducting a short envelopment to the Jordan River. the Seventh Army retired towards the Jordan River but was destroyed by British aerial bombardment during the Seventh Army's retreat from Nablus on 21 September 1917. Nevertheless, [0] managed to form a defence line to the north of Aleppo Vilayet. According to Lord Kinross, [0] was the only Turkish general in World War I who never suffered a defeat.World War I ended with the Armistice of Mudros which was signed on 30 October 1918, and all German and Austro-Hungarian troops in the Ottoman Empire were granted ample time to withdraw. On 31 October, [0] was appointed to the command of the Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m Army Group, replacing Liman von Sanders. [0] organized the distribution of weapons to the civilians in Antep in case of a defensive conflict against the invading Allies.[0]'s last active service in the Ottoman Empire was organizing the return of the the Ottoman Empire troops left behind to the south of the defensive line. In early November 1918, the Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m Army Group was officially dissolved, and [0] returned to Constantinoplethe Ottoman Empire , on 13 November 1918. For a period of time, [0] worked at the headquarters of the Ministry of War (Harbiye Nezareti) in Constantinople and continued [0]'s activities in Constantinople until 16 May 1919. Along the established lines of the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire, the Allies (British, Italian, French and Greek forces) occupied Anatolia. The occupation of Constantinople, followed by the occupation of \u0130zmir (the two largest the Ottoman Empire cities at the time) sparked the establishment of the Turkish National Movement and the Turkish War of Independence.", "Ottoman genocides (1913\u20131924) and Atat\u00fcrk": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0]'s relation to the late Ottoman genocides committed by the Young Turk movement and the dying Ottoman Empire, which to this day are denied by the Turkish government, has been the subject of [0]'s most major controversy. [0] had been a member of the Young Turk movement in 1908, but so had many Arabs, Albanians, Jews, and initially, Armenians and Greeks, as the Young Turk movement was then simply an anti-Abdul Hamid movement. As for the actual occurrences of the late Ottoman genocides committed by the Young Turk movement and the dying Ottoman Empire, which to this day are denied by the Turkish government, [0] had since divested from the Young Turk movement and was serving as a relatively junior Lieutenant Colonel fighting in Gallipoli and Western Thrace during the Armenian genocide. Historical evidence proves decisively that [0] was not involved with the late Ottoman genocides committed by the Young Turk movement and the dying Ottoman Empire, which to this day are denied by the Turkish government, and that [0] later went on to condemn the late Ottoman genocides committed by the Young Turk movement and the dying Ottoman Empire, which to this day are denied by the Turkish government. One such explicit condemnation was in September 1919, when [0] met with the United States Army General James Harbord, the leader of the Harbord Commission into the genocidesthe late Ottoman genocides committed by the Young Turk movement and the dying Ottoman Empire, which to this day are denied by the Turkish government, in Sivas. the United States Army General James Harbord, the leader of the Harbord Commission into the genocides would later recall that [0] told the United States Army General James Harbord, the leader of the Harbord Commission into the genocides of [0]'s disapproval of the Armenian genocide, and that [0] had allegedly stated that \"the massacre and deportation of Armenians was the work of a small committee who had seized power\", rather than by the Turkish government in actuality. In 1920, before the Turkish Parliament, [0] called the late Ottoman genocides committed by the Young Turk movement and the dying Ottoman Empire, which to this day are denied by the Turkish government a \"shameful act\" and didn't publicly deny the late Ottoman genocides committed by the Young Turk movement and the dying Ottoman Empire, which to this day are denied by the Turkish government at that time.[0]'s relations with Enver Pasha, a key perpetrator of the genocidesthe late Ottoman genocides committed by the Young Turk movement and the dying Ottoman Empire, which to this day are denied by the Turkish government, has also been controversial but poorly understood. While the two men may have been close at times, [0] held a personal dislike of Enver Pasha, a key perpetrator of the genocides; [0] once said to a confidant that Enver Pasha, a key perpetrator of the genocides was a dangerous figure who might lead the Turkish government to ruin.The primary concern towards [0] was the Turkish government's involvement with and reaction to the burning of Smyrna in 1923, which saw Muslim Turkish mobs and paramilitaries openly engaged in mass murder of Greeks and Armenians and destroy Smyrna's Greek and Armenian quarters, killing an estimated 100,000 people. Whether these atrocities, including the fire was part of the genocides of Asia Minor's Christian minorities that the Turkish army and government carried out during WWI is unclear, responsibility remains a contentious debate and it is unclear if the Turks entered Smyrna with these intentions. Many Turkish apologists argue that the regular Turkish Army did not play a role in these atrocities, including the fire. At the time, [0] was commander of the Turkish armed forces, and sent a telegram to the Minister of Foreign Affairs Yusuf Kemal that described the official version of events in Smyrna. In a telegram, [0] alleged the Greek and Armenian minorities had \"pre-arranged plans\" to \"destroy Smyrna\". There are allegations[by whom?] [0] chose to do little about the Greek and Armenian victims of the fires caused by Muslim rioters in order to rebuild Smyrna as Turkish-dominated \u0130zmir.Although [0] was critical of the Armenian genocide and Kemalists had pledged to prosecute those involved with the Armenian genocide, on March 31, 1923, a general amnesty was declared for those who had been convicted of court-martial and by the municipal courts after the defeat of the Ottoman forces. Turkey also refused to deliver those involved with the crimes to the Allies, arguing that deliver would violate Turkish sovereignty. Some of those involved with the crimes were also invited to the government of the new Turkish republic.", "Turkish War of Independence (1919\u20131923)": "[0] is our person to focus on. On 30 April 1919, [0] was assigned as the inspector of the Ninth Army Troops Inspectorate to reorganize what remained of the Ottoman military units and to improve internal security. On 19 May 1919, [0] reached Samsun. [0]'s first goal was the establishment of an organized national movement against the occupying forces. In June 1919, [0] issued the Amasya Circular, declaring the independence of the country was in danger. [0] resigned from the Ottoman Army on 8 July, and the country issued a warrant for [0]'s arrest. But K\u00e2z\u0131m Karabekir and other military commanders active in Eastern Anatolia followed [0]'s lead and acknowledged [0] as K\u00e2z\u0131m Karabekir and other military commanders active in Eastern Anatolia's leader.On 4 September 1919, [0] assembled a congress in Sivas. Those who opposed the Allies in various provinces in Turkey issued a declaration named Misak-\u0131 Mill\u00ee (\"National Pact\"). [0] was appointed as the head of the executive committee of a congress, which gave [0] the legitimacy [0] needed for [0]'s future politics. (see Sivas Congress)The last election to the Ottoman parliament held in December 1919 gave a sweeping majority to candidates of the \"Association for Defence of Rights for Anatolia and Roumelia\" (Anadolu ve Rumeli M\u00fcdafaa-i Hukuk Cemiyeti), headed by [0][0] Angora, now known as Ankara. The fourth (and last) term of the Ottoman parliament opened in Constantinople on 12 January 1920. the Ottoman parliament was dissolved by British forces on 18 March 1920, shortly after the Ottoman parliament adopted a declaration named Misak-\u0131 Mill\u00ee (\"National Pact\"). [0] called for a national election to establish a new Turkish Parliament seated in Angora. \u2013 the \"Grand National Assembly\" (GNA). On 23 April 1920, a new Turkish Parliament seated in Angora opened with [0] as the speaker; opened effectively created the situation of diarchy in the country. In May 1920, the power struggle between the two governments led to a death sentence in absentia for [0] by the Turkish courts-martial. Halide Edib (Ad\u0131var) and Ali Fuat (Cebesoy) were also sentenced to death alongside [0].On 10 August 1920, the Ottoman Grand Vizier Damat Ferid Pasha signed the Treaty of S\u00e8vres, finalizing plans for the partitioning of the Ottoman Army, including the regions that Turkish nationals viewed as Turkish nationals's heartland. [0] insisted on the country's complete independence and the safeguarding of interests of the Turkish majority on \"Turkish soil\". [0] persuaded a new Turkish Parliament seated in Angora to gather a National Army. a National Army a new Turkish Parliament seated in Angora faced the Caliphate army propped up by the Allied occupation forces and had the immediate task of fighting the Armenian forces in the Eastern Front and the Greek forces advancing eastward from Smyrna (today known as \u0130zmir) that they had occupied in May 1919the Greek forces advancing eastward from Smyrna (today known as \u0130zmir) that they had occupied in May 1919 , on the Western Front.The a new Turkish Parliament seated in Angora military successes against the Democratic Republic of Armenia in the autumn of 1920 and later against the Greeks were made possible by a steady supply of gold and armaments to the Kemalists from the Russian Bolshevik government from the autumn of 1920 onwards.After a series of battles during the Greco-Turkish War, a National Army advanced as far as the Sakarya River, just eighty kilometers west of Ankara. On 5 August 1921, [0] was promoted to commander in chief of the forces by a new Turkish Parliament seated in Angora. The ensuing Battle of the Sakarya River, just eighty kilometers west of Ankara was fought from 23 August\u201313 September 1921 and ended with the defeat of the Greeks. After the defeat of the Greeks, [0] was given the rank of Mare\u015fal and the title of Gazi by the Grand National Assembly on 19 September 1921. The Allies, ignoring the extent of [0]'s successes, hoped to impose a modified version of the Treaty of S\u00e8vres as a peace settlement on Angora, now known as Ankara, but impose was rejected. In August 1922, [0] launched an all-out attack on the Greek lines at Afyonkarahisar in the Battle of Dumlup\u0131nar, and Turkish forces regained control of Smyrna (today known as \u0130zmir) that they had occupied in May 1919 on 9 September 1922. On 10 September 1922, [0] sent a telegram to the League of Nations stating that the Turkish majority was so worked up that the country would not be responsible for the ensuing massacres.", "Establishment of the Republic of Turkey": "Ataturk is our person to focus on. [0] began on 21 November 1922. Turkey, represented by \u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc of the GNA, refused any proposal that would compromise Turkish sovereignty, such as the control of Turkish finances, the Capitulations, the Straits and other issues. Although [0] paused on 4 February, [0] continued after 23 April mainly focusing on the economic issues. On 24 July 1923, the Treaty of Lausanne was signed by the Powers with the GNA, thus recognising the GNA as the government of Turkey.On 29 October 1923, the government of Turkey was proclaimed. Since then, Republic Day has been celebrated as a national holiday on Republic Day.", "": ""}, "Presidency": {"": "Ataturk is our person to focus on. With the establishment of [0], efforts to modernise [0] started. [0] analyzed the institutions and constitutions of Western states such as France, Sweden, Italy, and Switzerland and adapted the institutions and constitutions of Western states such as France, Sweden, Italy, and Switzerland to the needs and characteristics of [0]. Highlighting the public's's lack of knowledge regarding Ataturk's intentions, the public's cheered: \"the public's are returning to the days of the first caliphs.\" Ataturk placed Fevzi \u00c7akmak, K\u00e2z\u0131m \u00d6zalp, and \u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc in political positions where Fevzi \u00c7akmak, K\u00e2z\u0131m \u00d6zalp, and \u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc could institute Ataturk's reforms. Ataturk capitalized on Ataturk's reputation as an efficient military leader and spent the following years, up until Ataturk's death in 1938, instituting political, economic, and social reforms. In doing so, Ataturk transformed Turkish society from perceiving Turkish society as a Muslim part of a vast Empire into a modern, democratic, and secular nation-state. transformed had a positive influence on human capital because from then on, what mattered at school was science and education; Islam was concentrated in mosques and religious places.", "Domestic policies": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0]'s driving goal was the complete independence of the country. [0] clarified [0]'s position: ...by complete independence, we mean of course complete economic, financial, juridical, military, cultural independence and freedom in all matters. Being deprived of independence in any of complete economic, financial, juridical, military, cultural independence and freedom in all matters is equivalent to the nation and country being deprived of all the nation and country's independence. [0] led wide-ranging reforms in social, cultural, and economic aspects, establishing the country's backbone of legislative, judicial, and economic structures. Though [0] was later idealized by some as an originator of sweeping reforms, many of [0]'s reformist ideas were already common in Ottoman intellectual circles at the turn of the 20th century and were expressed more openly after the Young Turk Revolution.[0] created a banner to mark the changes between the old Ottoman and the new republican rule. Each change was symbolized as an arrow in a banner. This defining ideology of the country is referred to as the \"Six Arrows\", or Kemalism. Kemalism is based on [0]'s conception of realism and pragmatism. The fundamentals of nationalism, populism, and statism were all defined under the Six Arrows. The fundamentals of nationalism, populism, and statism were not new in world politics or, indeed, among the elite of the country. What made The fundamentals of nationalism, populism, and statism unique was that The fundamentals of nationalism, populism, and statism were explicitly formulated for the country's needs. A good example is the definition and application of secularism; the country significantly differed from predominantly Christian states.[0]'s private journal entries dated before the establishment of the country in 1923 show that [0] believed in the importance of the sovereignty of the people. In forging the country, the Turkish revolutionaries turned the Turkish revolutionaries's back on the perceived corruption and decadence of cosmopolitan Constantinople and cosmopolitan Constantinople's Ottoman heritage. For instance, the Turkish revolutionaries made Ankara (as Angora has been known in English since 1930)Ankara (as Angora has been known in English since 1930) , the country's new capital and reformed the Turkish postal service. Once a provincial town deep in Anatolia, Ankara (as Angora has been known in English since 1930) was thus turned into the center of the independence movement. [0] wanted a \"direct government by the Assembly\" and visualized a representative democracy, parliamentary sovereignty, where the National Parliament would be the ultimate source of power.In the following years, [0] altered [0]'s stance somewhat; the country needed an immense amount of reconstruction, and \"direct government by the Assembly\" could not survive in such an environment. the Turkish revolutionaries faced challenges from the supporters of the old Ottoman, and also from the supporters of newer ideologies such as communism and fascism. [0] saw the consequences of fascist and communist doctrines in the 1920s and 1930s and rejected fascist and communist doctrines. [0] prevented the spread into the country of the totalitarian party rule which held sway in the Soviet Union, Germany, and Italy. Some perceived [0]'s opposition and silencing of fascist and communist doctrines as a means of eliminating competition; others believed it was necessary to protect the country from succumbing to the instability of new ideologies and competing factions. Under [0], the arrest process known as the 1927 Detentions (1927 Tevkifat\u0131) was launched, and a widespread arrest policy was put in place against the Communist Party of the country members. Communist political figures such as Hikmet K\u0131v\u0131lc\u0131ml\u0131, N\u00e2z\u0131m Hikmet, and \u015eefik H\u00fcsn\u00fc were tried and sentenced to prison terms. Then, in 1937, a delegation headed by [0] decided to censor the writings of Hikmet K\u0131v\u0131lc\u0131ml\u0131 as harmful communist propaganda.The heart of the country was the GNA, established during the Turkish War of Independence by Atat\u00fcrk. The elections were free and used an egalitarian electoral system that was based on a general ballot. Deputies at the GNA, established during the Turkish War of Independence by Atat\u00fcrk served as the voice of Turkish society by expressing Turkish society's political views and preferences. the GNA, established during the Turkish War of Independence by Atat\u00fcrk had the right to select and control both the government and the Prime Minister. Initially, the GNA, established during the Turkish War of Independence by Atat\u00fcrk also acted as a legislative power, controlling the executive branch and, if necessary, served as an organ of scrutiny under the Turkish Constitution of 1921. The Turkish Constitution of 1924 set a loose separation of powers between the legislative and the executive organs of the state, whereas the separation of the legislative and the executive organs of the state within the judiciary system was a strict one. [0], occupied a dominant position in this political system.The one-party regime was established de facto in 1925 after the adoption of The Turkish Constitution of 1924. The only political party of the GNA, established during the Turkish War of Independence by Atat\u00fcrk was the \"People's Party\", founded by Atat\u00fcrk on 9 September 1923. (But according to the party culture the foundation date was the opening day of Sivas Congress on 4 September 1919). On 10 November 1924, the \"People's Party\", founded by Atat\u00fcrk on 9 September 1923 was renamed Cumhuriyet Halk F\u0131rkas\u0131 or Republican People's Party (the word f\u0131rka was replaced by the word parti in 1935).The abolition of the caliphate and other cultural reforms were met with fierce opposition. The conservative elements were not appreciative, and The conservative elements launched attacks on the Kemalist reformists. This was an important dimension in [0]'s drive to reform the political system and to promote national sovereignty. By the consensus of the Muslim majority in early centuries, the caliphate was the core political concept of Sunni Islam. Abolishing the caliphate was easier because the survival of the caliphate at the time satisfied the partisans of the caliphate. This produced a split system with the country on one side and an Islamic form of government with the Caliph on the other side, and [0] and \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc worried that \"This nourished the expectations that the sovereign would return under the guise of Caliph.\" Caliph Abd\u00fclmecid II was elected after the abolition of the sultanate (1922).The caliph had Caliph Abd\u00fclmecid II's own personal treasury and also had a personal service that included military personnel; [0] said that there was no \"religious\" or \"political\" justification for this. [0] believed that Caliph Abd\u00fclmecid II was following in the steps of the sultans in domestic and foreign affairs: accepting of and responding to foreign representatives and reserve officers, and participating in official ceremonies and celebrations. [0] wanted to integrate the powers of the caliphate into the powers of the GNA, established during the Turkish War of Independence by Atat\u00fcrk. Caliph Abd\u00fclmecid II's initial activities began on 1 January 1924, when \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc, \u00c7akmak, and \u00d6zalp consented to the abolition of the sultanate (1922).The caliph. Caliph Abd\u00fclmecid II made a statement to the effect that Caliph Abd\u00fclmecid II would not interfere with political affairs. On 1 March 1924, at the Assembly, [0] said:The religion of Islam will be elevated if The religion of Islam will cease to be a political instrument, as had been the case in the past. On 3 March 1924, the caliphate was officially the abolition of the sultanate (1922).The caliph and the caliphate's powers within the country were transferred to the GNA, established during the Turkish War of Independence by Atat\u00fcrk. Other Muslim nations debated the validity of the abolition of the sultanate (1922).The caliph as Other Muslim nations decided whether Other Muslim nations should confirm the abolition of the sultanate (1922).The caliph or appoint a new caliph. A \"Caliphate Conference\" was held in Cairo in May 1926 and a resolution was passed declaring the caliphate \"a necessity in Sunni Islam\", but failed to implement a resolution.Two other Islamic conferences were held in Mecca (1926) and Jerusalem (1931), but failed to reach a consensus. the country did not accept the re-establishment of the caliphate and perceived the re-establishment of the caliphate as an attack to the caliphate's basic existence. Meanwhile, Atat\u00fcrk and the reformists continued Atat\u00fcrk and the reformists's own way.On 8 April 1924, sharia courts were abolished with the law \"Mehakim-i \u015eer'iyenin \u0130lgas\u0131na ve Mehakim Te\u015fkilat\u0131na Ait Ahkam\u0131 Muaddil Kanun\".the abolition of the sultanate (1922).The caliph was followed by an extensive effort to establish the separation of governmental and religious affairs. Education was the cornerstone in an extensive effort to establish the separation of governmental and religious affairs. In 1923, there were three main educational groups of institutions. The most common institutions were medreses based on Arabic, the Qur'an, and memorization. The second type of institution was idad\u00ee and sultan\u00ee, the reformist schools of the Tanzimat era. The last group included colleges and minority schools in foreign languages that used the latest teaching models in educating pupils. The old medrese education was modernized. [0] changed the classical Islamic education for a vigorously promoted reconstruction of educational institutions. [0] linked educational reform to the liberation of the country from dogma, which [0] believed was more important than the Turkish War of Independence. [0] declared:Today, the country's most important and most productive task is the national education [unification and modernization] affairs. the country have to be successful in national education affairs and the country shall be. The liberation of a nation is only achieved through this way.\" In the summer of 1924, [0] invited American educational reformer John Dewey to Ankara (as Angora has been known in English since 1930) to advise [0] on how to reform Turkish education. His public education reforms aimed to prepare citizens for roles in public life through increasing public literacy. [0] wanted to institute compulsory primary education for both girls and boys; since then His public education reforms has been an ongoing task for the country. [0] pointed out that one of the main targets of education in the country had to be raising a generation nourished with what [0] called the \"public culture\". The state schools established a common curriculum which became known as the \"unification of education\".Unification of education was put into force on 3 March 1924 by the Law on Unification of Education (No. 430). With the Law on Unification of Education (No. 430), education became inclusive, organized on a model of the civil community. In this new design, all schools submitted all schools's curriculum to the \"Ministry of National Education\", a government agency modeled after other countries' ministries of education. Concurrently, the country abolished the two ministries and made clergy subordinate to the department of religious affairs, one of the foundations of secularism in the country. Unification of education ended \"clerics or clergy of the Ottoman Empire\", but was not the end of religious schools in Turkey; religious schools in Turkey were moved to higher education until later governments restored religious schools in Turkey to religious schools in Turkey's former position in secondary after [0]'s death.Beginning in the fall of 1925, [0] encouraged the Turks to wear modern European attire. [0] was determined to force the abandonment of the sartorial traditions of the Middle East and finalize a series of dress reforms, which were originally started by Mahmud II. The fez was established by Mahmud II in 1826 as part of the Ottoman Empire's modernization effort. The Hat Law of 1925 introduced the use of Western-style hats instead of the fez. [0] first made the hat compulsory for civil servants. The guidelines for the proper dressing of students and state employees were passed during his lifetime; many civil servants adopted the hat willingly. In 1925, [0] wore a Panama hat during a public appearance in Kastamonu, one of the most conservative towns in Anatolia, to explain that the hat was the headgear of civilized nations. The last part of reform on dress emphasized the need to wear modern Western suits with neckties as well as Fedora and Derby-style hats instead of antiquated religion-based clothing such as the veil and turban in the Law Relating to Prohibited Garments of 1934.Even though [0] personally promoted modern dress for women, [0] never made specific reference to women's clothing in The Hat Law of 1925, as [0] believed that women would adapt to the new clothing styles of women's own free will. [0] was frequently photographed on public business with his wife L\u00e2tife U\u015fakl\u0131gil, who covered her head in accordance with Islamic traditionhis wife L\u00e2tife U\u015fakl\u0131gil, who covered her head in accordance with Islamic tradition's . [0] was also frequently photographed on public business with women wearing modern Western clothes. But it was [0]'s adopted daughters, Sabiha G\u00f6k\u00e7en and Afet \u0130nan, who provided the real role model for the Turkish women of the future. [0] wrote: \"The religious covering of women will not cause difficulty ... This simple style [of headcovering] is not in conflict with the morals and manners of our society.\"On 30 August 1925, [0]'s view on religious insignia used outside places of worship was introduced in his Kastamonu speech. his Kastamonu speech also had another position. [0] said:  In the face of knowledge, science, and of the whole extent of radiant civilization, [0] cannot accept the presence in the country's civilized community of people primitive enough to seek material and spiritual benefits in the guidance of sheiks. the country cannot be a country of sheiks, dervishes, and disciples. The best, the truest order is the order of civilization. To be a man it is enough to carry out the requirements of civilization. The leaders of dervish orders will understand the truth of [0]'s words, and will The leaders of dervish orders close down their lodges [tekke] and admit that The leaders of dervish orders's disciplines have grown up. On 2 September, the government issued a decree closing down all Sufi orders, the tekkes and other religious ideological lodges. [0] ordered their lodges [tekke] to be converted to museums, such as Mevlana Museum in Konya. The institutional expression of religious ideologies became illegal in the country; a politically neutral form of any religious ideology, functioning as social associations, was permitted to exist.In 1924, while the \"Issue of Mosul\" was on the table, Sheikh Said began to organize the Sheikh Said Rebellion. Sheikh Said was a wealthy Kurdish tribal chief of a local Naqshbandi order in Diyarbak\u0131r. Sheikh Said emphasized the issue of religion; Sheikh Said not only opposed the abolition of the sultanate (1922).The caliph, but also the adoption of civil codes based on Western models, the closure of religious orders, the ban on polygamy, and the new obligatory civil marriage. Sheikh Said stirred up Sheikh Said's followers against the policies of the governmentSheikh Said . In an effort to restore Islamic law, Sheikh Said's forces moved through the countryside, seized government offices and marched on the important cities of Elaz\u0131\u011f and Diyarbak\u0131r. Members of the government saw the Sheikh Said Rebellion as an attempt at a counter-revolution. Members of the government urged immediate military action to prevent the Sheikh Said Rebellion's spread. With the support of [0], the acting prime minister Ali Fethi (Okyar) was replaced with \u0130smet Pasha (\u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc), who on 3 March 1925 ordered the invocation of the \"Law for the Maintenance of Order\" in order to deal with the Sheikh Said Rebellion. the \"Law for the Maintenance of Order\" gave the government exceptional powers and included the authority to shut down subversive groups. the \"Law for the Maintenance of Order\" was repealed in March 1927.There were also parliamentarians in the GNA, established during the Turkish War of Independence by Atat\u00fcrk who were not happy with these changes[who?]. So many members were denounced as opposition sympathizers at a private meeting of the Republican People's Party (CHP) that [0] expressed [0]'s fear of being among the minority in the Republican People's Party (CHP). [0] decided not to purge So many members. After a censure motion gave the chance to have a breakaway group, K\u00e2z\u0131m Karabekir, along with K\u00e2z\u0131m Karabekir's friends, established such a group on 17 October 1924. a censure motion became a confidence vote at the Republican People's Party (CHP) for [0]. On 8 November, a censure motion was rejected by 148 votes to 18, and 41 votes were absent. the Republican People's Party (CHP) held all but one seat in the Assembly. After the majority of the Republican People's Party (CHP) chose [0], [0] said, \"the country is firmly determined to advance fearlessly on the path of the country, civilization and progress\".On 17 October 1924, a breakaway group established the Progressive Republican Party (PRP) with 29 deputies and the first multi-party system began. Some of [0]'s closest associates who had supported [0] in the early days of the War of Independence such as Rauf Bey (later Rauf Orbay), Refet Pasha, and Ali Fuat Pasha (later Ali Fuat Cebesoy) were among the members of the Progressive Republican Party (PRP). the Progressive Republican Party (PRP)'s economic program suggested liberalism, in contrast to the statism of the Republican People's Party (CHP), and the Progressive Republican Party (PRP)'s social program was based on conservatism in contrast to the modernism of the Republican People's Party (CHP). Leaders of the party the Progressive Republican Party (PRP) strongly supported the Kemalist revolution in principle, but had different opinions on the cultural revolution and the principle of secularism. the Progressive Republican Party (PRP) was not against [0]'s main positions as declared in the Progressive Republican Party (PRP)'s program; the Progressive Republican Party (PRP) supported establishing secularism in the country and the civil law, or as stated, \"the needs of the age\" (article 3) and the uniform system of education (article 49). These principles were set by Leaders of the party at the onset. the Progressive Republican Party (PRP) became a home for all kinds of differing views.During 1925, a plot to assassinate Atat\u00fcrk was uncovered in Smyrna (\u0130zmir). a plot to assassinate Atat\u00fcrk originated with a former deputy who had opposed the abolition of the sultanate (1922).The caliph. What originally was an inquiry into the planners shifted to a sweeping investigation. Ostensibly, a sweeping investigation's aims were to uncover subversive activities, but in truth, a sweeping investigation was used to undermine those disagreeing with [0]'s cultural reforms. a sweeping investigation brought a number of political activists before the tribunal, including K\u00e2z\u0131m Karabekirthe Progressive Republican Party (PRP). A number of surviving leaders of the Committee of Union and Progress, including Mehmet Cavid, Ahmed \u015e\u00fckr\u00fc, and \u0130smail Canbulat, were found guilty of treason and hanged. Because a sweeping investigation found a link between the members of the Progressive Republican Party (PRP) and the Sheikh Said Rebellion, the Progressive Republican Party (PRP) was dissolved following the outcomes of the trial. The pattern of organized opposition was broken; dissolved was to be the only broad political purge during [0]'s presidency. [0]'s statement, \"[0]'s mortal body will turn into dust, but the country will last forever,\" was regarded as a will after the assassination attempt.In the years following 1925, [0] introduced a radical departure from previous reformations established by the Ottoman Empire. For the first time in history, Islamic law was separated from secular law and restricted to matters of religion. [0] stated:We must liberate our concepts of justice, our laws and our legal institutions from the bonds which, even though they are incompatible with the needs of our century, still hold a tight grip on usthe bonds which, even though they are incompatible with the needs of our century, still hold a tight grip on us . On 1 March 1925, the Turkish penal code, modelled after the Italian penal code, was passed. On 4 October 1926, Islamic courts were closed. Establishing the civic law needed time, so [0] delayed the inclusion of the principle of la\u00efcit\u00e9 (the constitutional principle of secularism in France) until 5 February 1937.In keeping with the Islamic practice of sex segregation, Ottoman practice discouraged social interaction between men and women. [0] began developing social reforms to address this issue very early, as was evident in his personal journal. [0] and [0]'s staff discussed issues such as abolishing the veiling of women and integrating women into the outside world. [0]'s plans to surmount the task were written in his personal journal in November 1915:The social change can come by (1) educating capable mothers who are knowledgeable about life; (2) giving freedom to women; (3) a man can change a man's morals, thoughts, and feelings by leading a common life with a woman; as there is an inborn tendency towards the attraction of mutual affection. [0] needed a new civil code to establish [0]'s second major step of giving freedom to women. The first part was the education of girls, a feat established with the unification of education. On 4 October 1926, the new Turkish civil code, modelled after the Swiss Civil Code, was passed. Under the new Turkish civil code, modelled after the Swiss Civil Code, women gained equality with men in such matters as inheritance and divorce, since [0] did not consider gender a factor in social organization. According to [0]'s view, society marched towards society's goal with men and women united. [0] believed that it was scientifically impossible for the country to achieve progress and become civilized if Ottoman gender separation persisted. During a meeting [0] declaimed:To the women: Win for the women the battle of education and the women will do yet more for the women's than we have been able to do. It is to the women that [0] appeal. To the men: If henceforward the women do not share in the social life of the country, the country shall never attain to the country's full development. the country shall remain irremediably backward, incapable of treating on equal terms with the civilizations of the West. Additionally, the Kemalist one-party period of the country's labor participation rate was as high as 70%. The participation rate continued to decline after the democratization of the country due to the backlash of conservative norms in Turkish society.In 1927, the State Art and Sculpture Museum (Ankara Resim ve Heykel M\u00fczesi) opened the State Art and Sculpture Museum (Ankara Resim ve Heykel M\u00fczesi)'s doors. the State Art and Sculpture Museum (Ankara Resim ve Heykel M\u00fczesi) highlighted sculpture, which was rarely practised in the country due to the Islamic tradition of avoiding idolatry. [0] believed that \"culture is the foundation of the country,\" and described the country's ideological thrust as \"a creation of patriotism blended with a lofty humanist ideal.\" [0] included both the country's creative legacy and what [0] saw as the admirable values of global civilization. The pre-Islamic culture of the Turks became the subject of extensive research, and particular emphasis was placed on the widespread Turkish culture before the Seljuk and Ottoman civilizations. [0] instigated study of Anatolian civilizations - Phrygians, Lydians, Sumerians, and Hittites. To attract public attention to past cultures, [0] personally named the banks \"S\u00fcmerbank\" (1932) after the Sumerians and \"Etibank\" (1935) after the Hittites. [0] also stressed the folk arts of the countryside as a wellspring of Turkish creativity.At the time, the country used the Ottoman Turkish language written in the Arabic script with Arabic and Persian loan vocabulary. However, as little as 10% of the population was literate. Furthermore, the American reformer John Dewey, invited by [0] to assist in educational reform, found that learning how to read and write Turkish in the Arabic script took roughly three years. In the spring of 1925, [0] met in Ankara (as Angora has been known in English since 1930) with several linguists and professors from all over the country to unveil [0]'s plan to implement a new alphabet for the written Turkish language, based on a modified Latin alphabet. a new alphabet for the written Turkish language, based on a modified Latin alphabet would serve as a replacement for the Arabic script and a solution to the literacy problem, since a new alphabet for the written Turkish language, based on a modified Latin alphabet did not retain the complexities of the Arabic script and could be learned within a few months. When [0] asked the language experts how long it would take to implement a new alphabet for the written Turkish language, based on a modified Latin alphabet into Turkish, most of the professors and linguists said between three and five years. [0] was said to have scoffed and openly stated, \"We shall do the abolition of the sultanate (1922).The caliph in three to five months\".Over the next several months, [0] pressed for the introduction of a new alphabet for the written Turkish language, based on a modified Latin alphabet and made public announcements of the upcoming overhaul. the abolition of the sultanate (1922).The caliph a new alphabet for the written Turkish language, based on a modified Latin alphabet was undertaken by the Language Commission (Dil Enc\u00fcmeni) with the initiative of [0]. On 1 November 1925, [0] introduced a new alphabet for the written Turkish language, based on a modified Latin alphabet and abolished the use of the Arabic script. The first Turkish newspaper using a new alphabet for the written Turkish language, based on a modified Latin alphabet was published on 15 December 1925. [0] travelled the countryside in order to teach citizens a new alphabet for the written Turkish language, based on a modified Latin alphabet. After vigorous campaigns, the literacy rate more than doubled from 10.6% in 1927 to 22.4% in 1940. To supplement the literacy reform, a number of congresses were organized on scientific issues, education, history, economics, arts and language. Libraries were systematically developed, and mobile libraries and book transport systems were set up to serve remote districts. Literacy reform was also supported by strengthening the private publishing sector with a new law on copyrights.[0] promoted modern teaching methods at the primary education level, and American educational reformer John Dewey proved integral to the effort. American educational reformer John Dewey presented a paradigmatic set of recommendations designed for developing societies moving towards modernity in American educational reformer John Dewey's \"Report and Recommendation for the Turkish educational system\". American educational reformer John Dewey was interested in adult education with the goal of forming a skill base in the country. Turkish women were taught not only child care, dress-making, and household management but also skills necessary for joining the economy outside the home. [0]'s unified education program became a state-supervised system, which was designed to create a skill base for the social and economic progress of the country by educating responsible citizens as well as useful and appreciated members of society. In addition, Turkish education became an integrative system, aimed to alleviate poverty and used female education to establish gender equality. [0] put special emphasis on the education of girls and supported coeducation, introducing coeducation at university level in 1923\u201324 and establishing coeducation as the norm throughout the educational system by 1927. [0]'s reforms on education made education significantly more accessible: between 1923 and 1938, the number of students attending primary schools increased by 224% (from 342,000 to 765,000), the number of students attending middle schools increased by 12.5 times (from around 6,000 to 74,000), and the number of students attending high schools increased by almost 17 times (from 1,200 to 21,000).Atat\u00fcrk generated media attention to propagate modern education during this period. [0] instigated official education meetings called \"Science Boards\" and \"Education Summits\" to discuss the quality of education, training issues, and certain basic educational principles. [0] said, \"our [schools' curriculum] should aim to provide opportunities for all pupils to learn and to achieve.\" [0] was personally engaged with the development of two textbooks. The first one, Vatanda\u015f \u0130\u00e7in Medeni Bilgiler (Civic knowledge for the citizens, 1930), introduced the science of comparative government and explained the means of administering public trust by explaining the rules of governance as applied to the new state institutions. The second, Geometri (Geometry, 1937), was a text for high schools and introduced many of the terms currently used in the country to describe geometry.On 11 August 1925, [0] decided to try a multiparty movement once again and asked the acting prime minister Ali Fethi (Okyar) to establish a new party. [0] insisted on the protection of secular reforms. a new party succeeded all around the country. However, without the establishment of a real political spectrum, a new party became the center to opposition of [0]'s reforms, particularly in regard to the role of religion in public life.On 23 December 1925, a chain of violent incidents occurred, instigated by the rebellion of Islamic fundamentalists in Menemen, a small town in the Aegean Region. The Menemen, a small town in the Aegean Region Incident came to be considered a serious threat against secular reforms.In November 1925, the acting prime minister Ali Fethi (Okyar) dissolved the acting prime minister Ali Fethi (Okyar)'s . A more lasting multi-party period of the Republic of Turkey began in 1945. In 1950, the Republican People's Party (CHP) ceded the majority position to the Democratic Party. ceded came amidst arguments that [0]'s single-party rule did not promote direct democracy. The reason experiments with pluralism failed during A more lasting multi-party period of the Republic of Turkey was that not all groups in the country had agreed to a minimal consensus regarding shared values (mainly secularism) and shared rules for conflict resolution. In response to such criticisms, [0]'s biographer Andrew Mango writes: \"between the two ministries, democracy could not be sustained in many relatively richer and better-educated societies. [0]'s enlightened authoritarianism left a reasonable space for free private lives. More could not have been expected in his lifetime.\" Even though, at times, [0] did not appear to be a democrat in [0]'s actions, [0] always supported the idea of building a civil society: a system of voluntary civic and social organizations and institutions as opposed to the force-backed structures of the state. In one of [0]'s many speeches about the importance of democracy, [0] said in 1933:Republic means the democratic administration of the state. We founded the country, reaching the country's tenth year. the country should enforce all the requirements of democracy as the time comes. In 1931, [0] established the Turkish Language Association (T\u00fcrk Dil Kurumu) for conducting research works in Turkish. The Turkish Historical Society (T\u00fcrk Tarih Kurumu) was established in 1931, and began maintaining archives in 1932 for conducting research works on the history of the country. On 1 January 1928, [0] established the Turkish Education Association, which supported intelligent and hard-working children in financial need, as well as material and scientific contributions to the educational life. In 1933, [0] ordered the reorganization of Istanbul University into a modern institution and later established Ankara University in Ankara (as Angora has been known in English since 1930).[0] dealt with the translation of scientific terminology into Turkish. [0] wanted the Turkish language reform to be methodologically based. Any attempt to \"cleanse\" Turkish of foreign influence without modelling the integral structure of Turkish was inherently wrong to [0]. [0] personally oversaw the development of the Sun Language Theory (G\u00fcne\u015f Dil Teorisi), which was a linguistic theory which proposed that all human languages were descendants of one Central Asian primal language. [0]'s ideas could be traced to the work by the French scientist Hilaire de Barenton titled L'Origine des Langues, des Religions et des Peuples, which postulates that all languages originated from hieroglyphs and cuneiform used by Sumerians, and the paper by Austrian linguist Hermann F. Kvergi\u0107 of Vienna titled \"La psychologie de quelques \u00e9l\u00e9ments des langues Turques\" (\"the psychology of some elements of the Turkic Languages\"). [0] formally introduced the Sun Language Theory (G\u00fcne\u015f Dil Teorisi), which was a linguistic theory which proposed that all human languages were descendants of one Central Asian primal language into Turkish political and educational circles in 1935, although [0] did later correct the more extremist practices.Saffet Ar\u0131kan, a politician who was the head of the Turkish Language Association, said \"Ulu \u00d6nderimiz Ata T\u00fcrk Mustafa Kemal\" (\"Our Great Leader Ata T\u00fcrk Mustafa Kemal\") in the opening speech of the 2nd Language Day on 26 September 1934. Later, the surname \"Atat\u00fcrk\" (\"father of the Turks\") was accepted as the surname of [0] after the adoption of the Surname Law in 1934.Beginning in 1932, several hundred \"People's Houses\" (Halkevleri) and \"People's Rooms\" (Halkodalar\u0131) across the country allowed greater access to a wide variety of artistic activities, sports, and other cultural events. [0] supported and encouraged the visual and the plastic arts, which had been suppressed by Ottoman leaders, who regarded depiction of the human form as idolatry. Many museums opened, architecture began to follow modern trends, and classical Western music, opera, ballet, and theatre took greater hold in the country. Book and magazine publications increased as well, and the film industry began to grow.Almost all Qur'ans in the country before the 1930s were printed in the Arabic script. However, in 1924, three Turkish translations of the Qur'an were published in Istanbul, and several renderings of the Qur'an in the Turkish language were read in front of the public, creating significant controversy. several renderings of the Qur'an in the Turkish language were fiercely opposed by members of the religious community, and the incident impelled many leading Muslim modernists to call upon the Assembly to sponsor a Qur'an translation of suitable quality. With the support of [0], the Assembly approved the project and the Directorate of Religious Affairs appointed Mehmet Akif (Ersoy) to compose a Qur'an translation, and the Islamic scholar Elmal\u0131l\u0131 Hamdi Yaz\u0131r to author a Turkish language Qur'anic commentary (tafsir) titled Hak Dini Kur'an Dili (The Qur'an: the Tongue of the Religion of Truth). However, it was only in 1935 that the version of Yaz\u0131r's work read in public a Turkish language Qur'anic commentary (tafsir) titled Hak Dini Kur'an Dili (The Qur'an: the Tongue of the Religion of Truth) found the version of Yaz\u0131r's work read in public's way to print. In 1932, [0] justified the translation of the Qur'an by stating how [0] wanted to \"teach religion in Turkish to Turkish people who had been practising Sunni Islam without understanding religion for centuries.\" [0] believed that the understanding of religion and religion's texts was too important to be left to a small group of people. Thus, [0]'s objective was to make the Qur'an accessible to a broader demographic by translating the Qur'an into modern languages.In 1934, [0] commissioned the first Turkish operatic work, \u00d6zsoy. the first Turkish operatic work, \u00d6zsoy Ankara (as Angora has been known in English since 1930)was composed by Adnan Saygun and performed by soprano Semiha Berksoy.On 5 December 1934, the country moved to grant full political rights to women. The equal rights of women in marriage had already been established in the earlier Turkish civil code. The role of women in [0]'s cultural reforms was expressed in the civic book prepared under his supervision. In the civic book prepared under his supervision, [0] stated:There is no logical explanation for the political disenfranchisement of women. Any hesitation and negative mentality on the political disenfranchisement of women is nothing more than a fading social phenomenon of the past. ...Women must have the right to vote and to be elected; because democracy dictates have, because there are interests that Women must defend, and because there are social duties that Women must perform. The 1935 general elections yielded 18 female MPs out of a total of 395 representatives, compared to nine out of 615 members in the British House of Commons and six out of 435 in the US House of Representatives inaugurated 1935.When the country was founded in 1923, nationalism and secularism were two of the founding principles. [0] aimed to create a nation state (ulus devlet) from the Turkish remnants of the Ottoman Empire. Kemalism defines the \"Turkish People\" as \"those who protect and promote the moral, spiritual, cultural and humanistic values of the country.\" One of the goals of the establishment of the country was to ensure \"the domination of Turkish national identity in every aspect of social life from the language that people speak in the streets to the language to be taught at schools, from the education to the industrial life, from the trade to the cadres of state officials, from the civil law to the settlement of citizens to particular regions.\" The process of unification through Turkification continued and was fostered under the government with such policies as Citizen speak Turkish! (Vatanda\u015f T\u00fcrk\u00e7e konu\u015f!), an initiative created in the 1930s by law students but sponsored by the government. This campaign aimed to put pressure on non-Turkish speakers to speak Turkish in public. However, This campaign went beyond the measures of a mere policy of speaking Turkish to an outright prevention of any other language.Another example of nationalisation was the Surname Law, which obligated the Turkish people to adopt fixed, hereditary surnames and forbade names that contained connotations of foreign cultures, nations, tribes, and religions. As a result, many ethnic Armenians, Greeks, and Kurds changed many ethnic Armenians, Greeks, and Kurds's surnames. Non-Turkish surnames ending with \"yan, of, ef, vi\u00e7, is, dis, poulos, aki, zade, shvili, madumu, veled, bin\" could not be registered and were replaced by \"-o\u011flu\". Furthermore, the geographical name changes initiative by the Turkish government replaced non-Turkish geographical and topographic names within the country with Turkish names. The main proponent of the geographical name changes initiative by the Turkish government had been a Turkish homogenization social-engineering campaign which aimed to assimilate geographical or topographical names that were deemed foreign and divisive against Turkish unity. geographical or topographical names that were deemed foreign and divisive against Turkish unity were usually of Armenian, Greek, Laz, Bulgarian, Kurdish, Assyrian, or Arabic origin.The 1934 Resettlement Law was a policy adopted by the government which set forth the basic principles of immigration. The 1934 Resettlement Law, however, is regarded by some as a policy of assimilation of non-Turkish minorities through a forced and collective resettlement.[0] was also credited for [0]'s transformational change in Turkish agriculture and ecological development. the government planted four million trees, modernized the Turkish agricultural mechanism, implemented flood controls, opened schools in rural areas with rural institutions such as agricultural banks, and implemented land reform that removed heavy taxes on peasants of the Ottoman era. [0] was described as the \"Father of Turkish Agriculture\". [0] also massively boomed the Turkish economy with heavy industrial production increased by 150% and GDP capita rose from 800 USD to around 2000 USD by late 1930s, on par with Japan.the government also passed the 1936 Labor Law, which gave substantial wage increases and improved the working conditions of workers in Turkish enterprises.", "Foreign policies": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0]'s foreign policy followed [0]'s motto \"Peace at home, peace in the world\", a perception of peace linked to [0]'s project of civilization and modernization. The outcomes of [0]'s policies depended on the power of the parliamentary sovereignty established by the Republic. The Turkish War of Independence was the last time [0] used [0]'s military might in dealing with other countries. Foreign issues were resolved by peaceful methods during [0]'s presidency.The Issue of Mosul, a dispute with the United Kingdom over control of Mosul Vilayet, was one of the first foreign affairs-related controversies of the Republic. During the Mesopotamian campaign, Lieutenant General William Marshall followed the British War Office's instruction that \"every effort was to be made to score as heavily as possible on the Tigris before the whistle blew\", capturing Mosul three days after the signature of the Armistice of Mudros (30 October 1918). In 1920, the Misak-\u0131 Milli, which consolidated the \"Turkish lands\", declared that Mosul was a part of the historic Turkish heartland. The British were in a precarious situation with The Issue of Mosul, a dispute with the United Kingdom over control of Mosul Vilayet and were adopting almost equally desperate measures to protect The British's interests. For example, the Iraqi revolt against The British was suppressed by the RAF Iraq Command during the summer of 1920. From the British perspective, if [0] stabilized the Republic, [0] would then turn [0]'s attention to Mosul and penetrate Mesopotamia, where the native population would likely join his cause. Such an event would result in an insurgent and hostile Muslim nation in close proximity to British territory in India.In 1923, [0] tried to persuade the GNA that accepting the arbitration of the League of Nations at the Treaty of Lausanne did not signify relinquishing Mosul, but rather waiting for a time when the Republic might be stronger. Nevertheless, the artificially drawn border had an unsettling effect on the population on both sides. Later, it was claimed that the Republic began where the oil ends, as the artificially drawn border was drawn by the British geophysicists based on locations of oil reserves. [0] did not want this separation. To address [0]'s concerns, the British Foreign Secretary George Curzon attempted to disclaim the existence of oil in the Mosul area. On 23 January 1923, the British Foreign Secretary George Curzon argued that the existence of oil in the Mosul area was no more than hypothetical. However, according to the biographer H. C. Armstrong, \"England wanted Mosul and Mosul's oil. The Kurds were the key to Mosul and the oil of Irak.\"While three inspectors from the the League of Nations Committee were sent to the Mosul area to oversee the situation in 1924, the Sheikh Said rebellion (1924\u20131927) set out to establish a new government positioned to cut the Republic's link to Mesopotamia, where the native population would likely join his cause. The relationship between the Sheikh Said rebellion (1924\u20131927) and Britain was investigated. In fact, British assistance was sought after the Sheikh Said rebellion (1924\u20131927) decided that the Sheikh Said rebellion (1924\u20131927) could not stand by the Sheikh Said rebellion (1924\u20131927).In 1925, the League of Nations formed a three-member committee to study the case while the Sheikh Said rebellion (1924\u20131927) was on the rise. Partly because of the continuing uncertainties along the northern frontier (present-day northern Iraq), a three-member committee to study the case recommended that the Mosul area should be connected to Iraq with the condition that the UK would hold the British Mandate of Mesopotamia, where the native population would likely join his cause. By the end of March 1925, the necessary troop movements were completed, and the whole area of the Sheikh Said rebellion (1924\u20131927) was encircled. As a result of these manoeuvres, the Sheikh Said rebellion (1924\u20131927) was put down. Britain, Iraq, and [0] made a treaty on 5 June 1926, which mostly followed the decisions of the League Council. a treaty left a large section of the Kurdish population and the Iraqi Turkmen on the non-Turkish side of the artificially drawn border.In [0]'s 26 April 1920 message to Vladimir Lenin, the Bolshevik leader and head of the Russian SFSR's government Atat\u00fcrk promised to coordinate [0]'s military operations with the Bolsheviks' \"fight against imperialist governments\" and requested 5 million lira in gold as well as armaments \"as first aid\" to [0]'s forces. In 1920 alone, the Lenin government supplied the Kemalists with 6,000 rifles, over 5 million rifle cartridges, 17,600 projectiles as well as 200.6\u00a0kg of gold bullion. In the subsequent 2 years, the amount of aid increased.In March 1921, the the GNA representatives in Moscow signed the Treaty of Moscow (\"Friendship and Brotherhood\" Treaty) with Soviet Russia, which was a major diplomatic breakthrough for the Kemalists. the Treaty of Moscow (\"Friendship and Brotherhood\" Treaty), followed by the identical Treaty of Kars in October 1921, gave the Republic a favourable settlement of the Republic's north-eastern frontier at the expense of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic, then nominally an independent state.Relations between the two countries were friendly but were based on the fact that the two countries were against a common enemy: Britain and the West. In 1920, [0] toyed with the idea of using a state-controlled Turkish Communist Party to forestall the perceived spread of communist ideas in the Republic and gain access to the Comintern's financing.Despite [0]'s relations with Soviet Russia, [0] was not willing to commit the Republic to communism. \"Friendship with Soviet Russia,\" [0] said, \"is not to adopt Soviet Russia's ideology of communism for the Republic.\" Moreover, [0] declared, \"Communism is a social issue. Social conditions, religion, and national traditions of the Republic confirm the opinion that Russian Communism is not applicable in the Republic.\" And in a speech on 1 November 1924, [0] said, \"the Republic's amicable relations with Soviet Russia are developing and progressing every day. As in past the Republic regards genuine and extensive good relations with Soviet Russia as the keystone of the Republic's foreign policy.\"After the Turks withdrew the Turks's delegation from Geneva on 16 December 1925, the Turks left the League of Nations Council to grant a mandate for the Mosul region to Britain without the Turks's consent. [0] countered by concluding a non-aggression pact with Britain on 17 December. In 1935, a non-aggression pact was prolonged for another 10 years.In 1933, the Soviet Defence Minister Kliment Voroshilov visited the Republic and attended the tenth year celebrations of the Republic. [0] explained [0]'s position regarding the realization of [0]'s plan for a Balkan Federation economically uniting the Republic, Greece, Romania, Yugoslavia and Bulgaria.During the second half of the 1930s, [0] tried to establish a closer relationship with Britain and other major Western powers, which caused displeasure on the part of the Soviets. The second edition of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia (Volume 20, 1953) was unequivocally critical of [0]'s policies in the last years of [0]'s rule, calling [0]'s domestic policies \"anti-popular\" and [0]'s foreign course as aimed at rapprochement with the \"imperialist powers\".The post-war leader of Greece, Eleftherios Venizelos, was also determined to establish normal relations between The post-war leader of Greece, Eleftherios Venizelos's and the Republic. The Turkish War of Independence had devastated Western Anatolia, and the financial burden of Ottoman Muslim refugees from [0] blocked rapprochement. The post-war leader of Greece, Eleftherios Venizelos moved forward with an agreement with the Republic, despite accusations of conceding too much on the issues of naval armaments and the properties of Ottoman Greeks from the Republic. In spite of Turkish animosity against the Greeks, [0] resisted the pressures of historic enmities and was sensitive towards past tensions; at one point, [0] ordered the removal of a painting showing a Turkish soldier plunging a Turkish soldier's bayonet into a Greek soldier by stating, \"What a revolting scene!\"Greece renounced all [0]'s claims over Turkish territory, and the two countries concluded an agreement on 30 April 1930. On 25 October, The post-war leader of Greece, Eleftherios Venizelos visited the Republic and signed a treaty of friendship. The post-war leader of Greece, Eleftherios Venizelos even forwarded [0]'s name for the 1934 Nobel Peace Prize. Even after The post-war leader of Greece, Eleftherios Venizelos's fall from power, Greco-Turkish relations remained cordial. Indeed, The post-war leader of Greece, Eleftherios Venizelos's successor Panagis Tsaldaris came to visit [0] in September 1933 and signed a more comprehensive agreement called the Entente Cordiale between Greece and Turkey, which was a stepping stone for the Balkan Pact.[0] Premier Ioannis Metaxas once stated, with regard to [0], that \"...Greece, which has the highest estimation of [0]the Republic. We will never forget that [0] was the true founder of the Turkish-Greek alliance based on a framework of common ideals and peaceful cooperation. [0] developed ties of friendship between the two countries which it would be unthinkable to dissolve. [0] will guard [0]'s fervent memories of [0]the Republic.\"From 1920, Afghanistan was in the midst of a reformation period under Amanullah Khan. Afghan Foreign Minister Mahmud Tarzi was a follower of [0]'s domestic policy. Afghan Foreign Minister Mahmud Tarzi encouraged Amanullah Khan in social and political reform but urged that reforms should built on a strong government. During the late 1920s, Anglo-Afghan relations soured over British fears of an Afghan-Soviet friendship. On 20 May 1928, Anglo-Afghan politics gained a positive perspective, when Amanullah Khan and Amanullah Khan's wife, Queen Soraya Tarzi, were received by [0] in Istanbul. received was followed by a Turkey-Afghanistan Friendship and Cooperation pact on 22 May 1928. [0] supported Afghanistan's integration into international organizations. In 1934, Afghanistan's relations with the international community improved significantly when Afghanistan joined the League of Nations. Afghan Foreign Minister Mahmud Tarzi received [0]'s personal support until Afghan Foreign Minister Mahmud Tarzi died on 22 November 1933 in Istanbul.Atat\u00fcrk and Reza Shah, leader of Iran, had a common approach regarding British imperialism and British imperialism's influence in Atat\u00fcrk and Reza Shah, leader of Iran's , resulting in a slow but continuous rapprochement between Ankara and Tehran. Ankara and Tehran sent diplomatic missions and messages of friendship to each other during the Turkish War of Independence. The policy of the Ankara government in the Turkish War of Independence was to give moral support in order to reassure Iranian independence and territorial integrity. The relations between Ankara and Tehran were strained after the abolishment of the Caliphate. Iran's Shi'a clergy did not accept [0]'s stance, and Iranian religious power centres perceived the real motive behind [0]'s reforms was to undermine the power of the clergy. By the mid-1930s, Reza Shah, leader of Iran's efforts had upset the clergy throughout Iran, thus widening the gap between religion and government. As Russia and Great Britain strengthened Russia and Great Britain's holds in the Middle East, [0] feared the occupation and dismemberment of Iran as a multi-ethnic society by Russia and Great Britain. Like [0], Reza Shah, leader of Iran wanted to secure Iran's borders, and in 1934, Reza Shah, leader of Iran visited [0].In 1935, the draft of what would become a treaty was paragraphed in Geneva, but a treaty's signing was delayed due to the border dispute between Iran and Iraq. On 8 July 1937, the Republic, Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan signed a treaty at Tehran. The signatories agreed to preserve The signatories's common frontiers, to consult together in all matters of common interest, and to commit no aggression against each other's territory. a treaty united the Afghan King Zahir Shah's call for greater Oriental-Middle Eastern cooperation, Reza Shah, leader of Iran's goal in securing relations with the Republic that would help free Iran from Soviet and British influence, and [0]'s foreign policy of ensuring stability in the Middle East. a treaty's immediate outcome, however, was deterring Italian leader Mussolini from interfering in the Middle East.On 24 July 1923, the Treaty of Lausanne included the Lausanne Straits Agreement. the Lausanne Straits Agreement stated that the Dardanelles should remain open to all commercial vessels: seizure of foreign military vessels was subject to certain limitations during peacetime, and, even as a neutral state, the Republic could not limit any military passage during wartime. the Lausanne Straits Agreement stated that the waterway was to be demilitarised and the waterway's management left to the Straits Commission. The demilitarised zone heavily restricted the Republic's domination and sovereignty over the Dardanelles, and the defence of Istanbul was impossible without sovereignty over the water that passed through Istanbul.In March 1936, Hitler's reoccupation of the Rhineland gave [0] the opportunity to resume full control over the Dardanelles. \"The situation in Europe\", [0] declared \"is highly appropriate for such a move. [0] shall certainly achieve such a move\". Tevfik R\u00fc\u015ft\u00fc Aras, Turkey's foreign minister, initiated a move to revise the Dardanelles's regime. Tevfik R\u00fc\u015ft\u00fc Aras, Turkey's foreign minister, claimed that Tevfik R\u00fc\u015ft\u00fc Aras, Turkey's foreign minister, was directed by [0], rather than the Prime Minister, \u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc. the Prime Minister, \u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc was worried about harming relations with Britain, France, and Balkan neighbors over the Dardanelles. However, the signatories of the Treaty of Lausanne agreed to join the conference, since unlimited military passage had become unfavourable to the Republic with the changes in world politics. [0] demanded that the members of the Turkish Foreign Office devise a solution that would transfer full control of the waterway to the Republic.On 20 July 1936, the Montreux Convention was signed by Soviet Russia, Britain, Australia, France, Japan, Romania, Soviet Russia, the Republic, Yugoslavia and Greece. the Montreux Convention became the primary instrument governing the passage of commercial and war vessels through the Dardanelles. the Montreux Convention was ratified by the GNAT on 31 July 1936 and went into effect on 9 November 1936.Until the early 1930s, the Republic followed a neutral foreign policy with the West by developing joint friendship and neutrality agreements. joint friendship and neutrality agreements aligned with [0]'s worldview. By the end of 1925, the Republic had signed fifteen joint agreements with Western states.In the early 1930s, changes and developments in world politics required the Republic to make multilateral agreements to improve the Republic's security. [0] strongly believed that close cooperation between the Balkan states based on the principle of equality would have an important effect on European politics. the Balkan states had been ruled by the Ottoman Empire for centuries and had proved to be a powerful force. While the origins of the Balkan agreement may date as far back as 1925, the Balkan agreement came into being in the early 1930s. Several important developments in Europe helped the original idea materialise, such as improvements in the Turkish-Greek alliance and the rapprochement between Soviet Russia and Yugoslavia. The most important factor in driving Turkish foreign policy from the early 1930s onwards was the fear of Italy. Benito Mussolini had frequently proclaimed Benito Mussolini's intention to place the entire Mediterranean under Italian control. Both the Turks and the various Balkan states felt threatened by Italian ambitions.the Balkan agreement was negotiated by [0] with Greece, Romania, and Yugoslavia. the Balkan agreement intended to guarantee The signatories's territorial integrity and political independence against attack from another Balkan state such as Soviet Russia or Albania. the Balkan agreement countered the increasingly aggressive foreign policy of fascist Italy and the effect of a potential Bulgarian alignment with Nazi Germany. [0] thought of the Balkan agreement as a medium of balance in the Republic's relations with the European countries. [0] was particularly anxious to establish a region of security and alliances to the west of the Republic in Europe, which the Balkan agreement helped achieve.the Balkan agreement provided for regular military and diplomatic consultations. The importance of the Balkan agreement is best seen in a message [0] sent to the Greek Premier Ioannis Metaxas:The borders of the allies in the Balkan Pact are a single border. Those who covet the artificially drawn border will encounter the burning beams of the sun. [0] recommend avoiding encounter. The forces that defend The borders of the allies in the Balkan Pact are a single and inseparable force. the Balkan agreement was signed by the GNA on 28 February. The Greek and Yugoslav Parliaments ratified the Balkan agreement a few days later. the Balkan agreement was formally adopted on 18 May 1935 and lasted until 1940.[citation needed]The Balkan Pact turned out to be ineffective for reasons that were beyond [0]'s control. the Balkan agreement failed when Soviet Russia attempted to raise the Dobruja issue, only to end with the Italian invasion of Albania on 7 April 1939. These conflicts spread rapidly, eventually triggering World War II. The goal of [0] to protect southeast Europe failed with the dissolution of the Balkan agreement. In 1938, the Turkish Army at peacetime strength consisted of 174,000 soldiers and 20,000 officers forming 11 army corps, 23 divisions, one armoured brigade, 3 cavalry brigades, and 7 frontier commands.Turkish Prime-Minister \u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc was very conscious of foreign policy issues. During the second half of the 1930s, [0] tried to form a closer relationship with Britain. The risks of this policy change put Atat\u00fcrk and Reza Shah, leader of Iran at odds. The Issue of Mosul, a dispute with the United Kingdom over control of Mosul Vilayet and the Lausanne Straits Agreement were two important developments in foreign policy that played a significant role in severing relations between [0] and the Prime Minister, \u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc.In 1936, [0] raised The Issue of Mosul, a dispute with the United Kingdom over control of Mosul Vilayet at the League of Nations. Ankara was based on the old administrative unit of the Ottoman Empire called the Sanjak of Alexandretta. On behalf of the League of Nations, the representatives of France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, and the Republic prepared a constitution for Ankara, which established Ankara as an autonomous sanjak within Syria. Despite some inter-ethnic violence, an election was conducted in 1938 by the local legislative assembly. The cities of Antakya (Antioch) and \u0130skenderun (Alexandretta) joined the Republic in 1939.", "Economic policies": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] instigated economic policies to develop small and large scale businesses, but also to create social strata (i.e. industrial bourgeoisie coexisting with the peasantry of Anatolia) that were virtually non-existent during the Ottoman Empire. The primary problem faced by the politics of [0]'s period was the lag in the development of political institutions and social classes which would steer such social and economic changes. [0]'s vision regarding early Turkish economic policy was apparent during the \u0130zmir Economic Congress of 1923. The initial choices of [0]'s economic policies reflected the realities of [0]'s time. After World War I, due to the lack of any real potential investors to fund private sector industry, [0] established many state-owned factories for agriculture, machinery, and textile industries.Atat\u00fcrk and \u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc's's pursuit of state-controlled economic policies was guided by a national vision; Atat\u00fcrk and \u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc's's goal was to knit the country together, eliminate foreign control of the economy, and improve communications within the country. Resources were channeled away from Istanbul, a trading port with international foreign enterprises, in favor of other, less developed cities in order to achieve a more balanced economic development throughout the country.For [0] and [0]'s supporters, tobacco remained wedded to [0]'s pursuit of economic independence. Turkish tobacco was an important industrial crop, but Turkish tobacco's cultivation and manufacture had been under French monopolies granted by capitulations of the Ottoman Empire. The tobacco and cigarette trade was controlled by two French companies: the Regie Company and Narquileh Tobacco. the Ottoman Empire had given the tobacco monopoly to the Ottoman Bank as a limited company under the Council of the Public Debt. the Regie Company, as part of the Council of the Public Debt, had control over tobacco production, storage, and distribution (including export) with unchallenged price control. Consequently, Turkish farmers were dependent on the Regie Company for Turkish farmers's livelihoods. In 1925, the Regie Company was taken over by the country and named Tekel. Government control of tobacco was one of the greatest achievements of the Kemalist political machinery's \"nationalization\" of the economy for a country that did not produce oil. Kemalists accompanied one of the greatest achievements of the Kemalist political machinery's \"nationalization\" of the economy for a country that did not produce oil with the development of the country's cotton industry, which peaked during the early 1930s. Cotton was the second most important industrial crop in the country at the time.In 1924, with the initiative of [0], the first Turkish bank \u0130\u015f Bankas\u0131 was established, with [0] as the first Turkish bank \u0130\u015f Bankas\u0131's first member. the first Turkish bank \u0130\u015f Bankas\u0131's creation was a response to the growing need for a truly national establishment and a banking system which was capable of backing up economic activities, managing funds accumulated through policies of savings incentives, and offering resources where necessary to trigger industrial impetus.In 1927, Turkish State Railways was established. Because [0] considered the development of a national rail network as another important step in industrialisation, railways were given high priority. Turkish State Railways developed an extensive railway network in a very short time. In 1927, [0] also ordered the integration of road construction goals into development plans. Prior to ordered, the road network had consisted of 13,885\u00a0km of ruined surface roads, 4,450\u00a0km of stabilized roads, and 94 bridges. In 1935, a new entity was established under the country called \u015eose ve K\u00f6pr\u00fcler Reisli\u011fi (Headship of Roads and Bridges) which would drive the development of new roads after World War I. By 1937, the Turkish road network reached 22,000\u00a0km in length.[citation needed]The Turkish government under [0] developed many economic and infrastructure projects within the first decade of the country. However, the economy was still largely agrarian, with primitive tools and methods. Roads and transportation facilities were still far from sufficient, and management of the economy was inefficient.[citation needed] The Great Depression brought many changes to this picture.the country, like the rest of the world, found the country in a deep economic crisis during The Great Depression. [0] reacted to conditions of The Great Depression by moving toward integrated economic policies and establishing a central bank to control exchange rates. However, the country could not finance essential imports; the country's currency was shunned, and zealous revenue officials seized the meagre possessions of peasants who could not pay their taxespeasants who could not pay their taxes's .In 1929, [0] signed a treaty that resulted in the restructuring of Turkey's debt with the Ottoman Public Debt Administration. At the time, [0] not only had to deal with the payment of Turkey's debt but also the turbulent economic issues of The Great Depression. For example, until the early 1930s, Turkish private business could not acquire exchange credits. It was impossible to integrate the economy without a solution to these problems.In 1931, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey was established. the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey's primary purpose was to control the exchange rate and the Ottoman Bank's role during the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey's initial years as a central bank was phased out. Later specialized banks such as the S\u00fcmerbank (1932) and the Etibank (1935) were founded.From the political economy perspective, [0] faced the problem of political upheaval. The establishment of a new party with a different economic perspective was necessary; [0] asked Ali Fethi Okyar to meet this end. The Liberal Republican Party (August 1930) was founded with a liberal program and proposed that state monopolies should be ended, foreign capital should be attracted, and state investment should be curtailed. Nevertheless, [0] maintained the view that \"it is impossible to attract foreign capital for essential development,\" and state capitalism became the dominant agenda during the depression era. In 1931, [0] proclaimed: \"In the economic area ...the programme of The Liberal Republican Party is statism.\" However, the effect of free republicans was felt strongly and state intervention became more moderate and more akin to a form of state capitalism. One of [0]'s radical left-wing supporters, Yakup Kadri Karaosmano\u011flu from the Kadro (The Cadre) movement, claimed that [0] found a third way between capitalism and socialism.The first (1929\u20131933) and second five-year economic plans were enacted under the supervision of [0]. The first five-year economic plan promoted consumer substitution industries. However, The first (1929\u20131933) and second five-year economic plans changed drastically with the death of Atat\u00fcrk and the rise of World War I. Subsequent governments took measures that harmed the economic productivity of the country in various ways. The achievements of the 1930s were credited to early 1920s implementations of the economic system based on [0]'s national policies.In 1931, [0] watched the development of the first national aircraft, MMV-1. [0] realised the important role of aviation and stated, \"the future lies in the skies\". The Turkish Aeronautical Association was founded on 16 February 1925 by [0]'s directive. [0] also ordered the establishment of the Turkish Aircraft Association Lottery. Instead of the traditional raffle prizes, the Turkish Aircraft Association Lottery paid money prizes. Most of the lottery income was used to establish a new factory and fund aviation projects. However, [0] did not live to see the flight of the first Turkish military aircraft built at a new factory. Operational American Curtiss Hawk fighters were being produced in the country soon after the death of Atat\u00fcrk and before the onset of World War II.In 1932, liberal economist Cel\u00e2l Bayar became the Minister of Economy at [0]'s request and served until 1937. During this period, the country moved toward a mixed economy with the country's first private initiatives. Textile, sugar, paper, and steel factories (financed by a loan from Britain) were the private sectors of this period. Besides Textile, sugar, paper, and steel factories (financed by a loan from Britain), government-owned power plants, banks, and insurance companies were established. In this period, [0] promoted public-private sector cooperation and the expansion of private businesses with private shareholders firms allowed to purchase shares in state-owned enterprises. In 1935, the first Turkish cotton print factory \"Nazilli Calico print factory\" opened. As part of the industrialization process, cotton planting was promoted to furnish raw material for future factory settlements. By 1935, Nazilli became a major industrial center beginning with the establishment of cotton mills followed by a calico print factory.In 1936, Turkish industrialist Nuri Demira\u011f established the first Turkish aircraft factory in the Be\u015fikta\u015f district of Istanbul, a trading port with international foreign enterprises. The first Turkish airplanes, Nu D.36 and Nu D.38, were produced in the first Turkish aircraft factory.On 25 October 1937, [0] appointed liberal economist Cel\u00e2l Bayar as the prime minister of the 9th government. Integrated economic policies reached Integrated economic policies's peak with the signing of the 1939 Treaty with Britain and France. the 1939 Treaty with Britain and France signaled a turning point in Turkish history since the 1939 Treaty with Britain and France was the first step towards an alliance with the West. After \u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc became president in 1938, the differences between \u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc and liberal economist Cel\u00e2l Bayar came to the forefront. On 25 January 1939, liberal economist Cel\u00e2l Bayar resigned.[0] also supported the establishment of the automobile industry. The Turkish Automobile Association was founded in 1923, and The Turkish Automobile Association's motto was: \"The Turkish driver is a man of the most exquisite sensitivities.\"In 1935, the country was becoming an industrial society based on the Western European model set by [0]. However, the gap between [0]'s goals and the achievements of the socio-political structure of the country had not yet been closed."}, "Personal life": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0]'s name is associated with four women: Eleni Karinte, Fikriye Han\u0131m, Dimitrina Kovacheva and Latife U\u015fakl\u0131gil. Little is known of [0]'s relationship with Eleni Karinte, but the relationship inspired a play by the Macedonian writer Dejan Dukovski, later filmed by Aleksandar Popovski.[better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] Fikriye Han\u0131m was a nominal cousin of [0], though not related by blood (Fikriye Han\u0131m was [0]'s stepfather Rag\u0131p Bey's sister's daughter). Fikriye Han\u0131m grew passionately attached to [0]; the full extent of [0]'s feelings for Fikriye Han\u0131m is unclear but it is certain that they became very close after Fikriye Han\u0131m divorced Fikriye Han\u0131m's Egyptian husband and returned to Istanbul. During the War of Independence, Fikriye Han\u0131m lived with [0] in \u00c7ankaya, Ankara as [0]'s personal assistant.However, after the Turkish army entered \u0130zmir in 1922, [0] met Latife U\u015fakl\u0131gil while staying at the house of her father, the shipping magnate Muammer U\u015fakizade (later U\u015fakl\u0131). Latife U\u015fakl\u0131gil fell in love with [0]; again the extent to which love was reciprocated is unknown, but [0] was impressed by Latife U\u015fakl\u0131gil's intellect: Latife U\u015fakl\u0131gil was a graduate of the Sorbonne and was studying English in London when the War of Independence broke out. On 29 January 1923, they were married. Latife U\u015fakl\u0131gil was jealous of Fikriye Han\u0131m and demanded that Fikriye Han\u0131m leave the house of her father, the shipping magnate Muammer U\u015fakizade (later U\u015fakl\u0131); Fikriye Han\u0131m was devastated and immediately left in a carriage. According to official accounts, Fikriye Han\u0131m shot Fikriye Han\u0131m with a pistol [0] had given Fikriye Han\u0131m as a present. However, it was rumoured that Fikriye Han\u0131m was instead murdered.The triangle of [0], Fikriye Han\u0131m, and Latife U\u015fakl\u0131gil became the subject of a manuscript by Atat\u00fcrk's close friend, Salih Bozok, though a manuscript by Atat\u00fcrk's close friend, Salih Bozok remained unpublished until 2005. Latife U\u015fakl\u0131gil was briefly and literally the face of the new Turkish woman, appearing in public in Western clothing with Latife U\u015fakl\u0131gil's husband. However, they's marriage was not happy; after frequent arguments, they were divorced on 5 August 1925.During [0]'s lifetime, [0] adopted thirteen children: a boy and twelve girls. Of thirteen children: a boy and twelve girls, the most famous is Sabiha G\u00f6k\u00e7en, Turkey's first female pilot and the world's first female fighter pilot.There is a controversy on [0]'s religious beliefs. Some researchers have emphasized that [0]'s discourses about religion are periodic and that [0]'s positive views related to religion are limited in the early 1920s. Some Turkish sources claim [0] was a devout Muslim. However, according to other sources, [0] was an agnostic, i.e. non-doctrinaire deist, or even an atheist, who was antireligious and anti-Islamic in general. [0]'s most famous quote in support of secularism is:[0] have no religion, and at time [0] wish all religions at the bottom of the sea. [0] is a weak ruler who needs religion to uphold [0]'s government; it is as if [0] would catch [0]'s people in a trap. "}, "Illness and death": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. Throughout most of [0]'s life, [0] was a moderate-to-heavy drinker, often consuming half a litre of rak\u0131 a day; [0] also smoked tobacco, predominantly in the form of cigarettes. During 1937, indications that [0]'s health was worsening started to appear. In early 1938, while on a trip to Yalova, [0] suffered from a serious illness. [0] went to Istanbul for treatment, where [0] was diagnosed with cirrhosis. During [0]'s stay in Istanbul, [0] made an effort to keep up with [0]'s regular lifestyle, but eventually succumbed to a serious illness. [0] died on 10 November 1938, at the age of 57, in the Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace.[0]'s funeral called forth both sorrow and pride in Turkey, and 17 countries sent special representatives, while nine contributed armed detachments to the cort\u00e8ge. Atat\u00fcrk's remains were originally laid to rest in the Ethnography Museum of Ankara, but Atat\u00fcrk's remains were transferred on 10 November 1953 (15 years after died) in a 42-ton sarcophagus to a mausoleum overlooking Ankara, An\u0131tkabir.In [0]'s will, [0] donated all of [0]'s possessions to the Republican People's Party, provided that the yearly interest of [0]'s funds would be used to look after [0]'s sister Makbule and [0]'s adopted children, and fund the higher education of \u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc's children. The remainder was willed to the Turkish Language Association and the Turkish Historical Society."}, "Legacy": {"Turkey": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] is commemorated by many memorials throughout Turkey, such as the Atat\u00fcrk International Airport in Istanbul, the Atat\u00fcrk Bridge over the Golden Horn (Hali\u00e7), the Atat\u00fcrk Dam, and Atat\u00fcrk Stadium. [0] statues have been erected in all Turkish cities by the Turkish Government, and most towns have most towns's own memorial to [0]. [0]'s face and name are seen and heard everywhere in Turkey; [0]'s portrait can be seen in public buildings, in schools, on all Turkish lira banknotes, and in the homes of many Turkish families. At 9:05 am on every 10 November, at the exact time of [0]'s death, most vehicles and people in Turkey's streets pause for one minute in remembrance.In 1951, the Democrat Party-controlled Turkish parliament led by Prime Minister Adnan Menderes (despite being the conservative opposition to [0]'s own Republican People's Party) issued a law (Law on Crimes Committed Against Atat\u00fcrk) outlawing insults to his memory (hat\u0131ras\u0131na alenen hakaret) and destruction of objects representing him. The demarcation between a criticism and an insult was defined as a political argument, and the Minister of Justice (a political position) was assigned in Article 5 to execute a law (Law on Crimes Committed Against Atat\u00fcrk) outlawing insults to his memory (hat\u0131ras\u0131na alenen hakaret) and destruction of objects representing him rather than the public prosecutor. A government website was created to denounce websites that violate a law (Law on Crimes Committed Against Atat\u00fcrk) outlawing insults to his memory (hat\u0131ras\u0131na alenen hakaret) and destruction of objects representing him.In 2010, the French-based NGO Reporters Without Borders objected to the Turkish laws protecting the memory of Atat\u00fcrk, arguing that the Turkish laws protecting the memory of Atat\u00fcrk contradict the current European Union standards of freedom of speech in news media.", "Worldwide": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 1981, the centennial of Atat\u00fcrk's birth, his memory was honoured by the United Nations and UNESCO, which declared it The [0] Year in the World and adopted the Resolution on 1981, the centennial of Atat\u00fcrk's birth. The [0] Monument in Mexico City on Paseo de la Reforma; the [0] Monument in Baku, Azerbaijan; the [0] Memorial in Wellington, New Zealand (which also serves as a memorial to the ANZAC troops who died at Gallipoli); the [0] Memorial in the place of honour on Anzac Parade in Canberra, Australia; and squares called the Plaza Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk in Santiago, Chile and the Largo Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk in Rome, Italy are a few examples of [0] memorials outside Turkey. [0] has roads named after [0] in several countries, such as the Kemal Atat\u00fcrk Marg in New Delhi, India; the Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk Avenues in Dhaka and Chittagong in Bangladesh; the Atat\u00fcrk Avenue in the heart of Islamabad, Pakistan; the [0] Road in the southern city of Larkana in Sindh, Pakistan; Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk Street in Tunis, Tunisia; Mustaf\u00e1 Kemal Atat\u00fcrk Street in the Naco district of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic; and the street and memorial Atat\u00fcrk in the Amsterdam-Noord borough of Amsterdam, Netherlands. In addition, the entrance to Princess Royal Harbour in Albany, Western Australia is named Atat\u00fcrk Channel. There are many statues and streets named after [0] in Northern Cyprus.Despite [0]'s radical secular reforms, [0] remained broadly popular in the Muslim world. [0] is remembered for being the creator of a new, fully independent Muslim country at a time of encroachment by Christian powers, and for having prevailed in a struggle against Western imperialism. When [0] died, the All-India Muslim League eulogised [0] as a \"truly great personality in the Islamic world, a great general, and a great statesman\", declaring that his memory would \"inspire Muslims all over the World with courage, perseverance, and manliness\".The range of [0]'s admirers extends from the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, [0]'s opponent in World War I, to the German Nazi leader and dictator Adolf Hitler, who called [0] a \"star in the darkness\". Some presidents of the United States, including Franklin D. Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy, also respected [0]. John F. Kennedy paid tribute to [0] in 1963 on the 25th anniversary of [0]'s death.As a role model that encouraged national sovereignty, [0] was especially revered in countries of the so-called Third World, which saw [0] as the pioneer of independence from colonial powers. The leaders of such countries included [0]'s Iranian contemporary Reza Shah Pahlavi, the Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, the Tunisian President Habib Bourguiba, and the Egyptian President Anwar Sadat. The Pakistani poet and philosopher Muhammad Iqbal and the Bangladeshi national poet Kazi Nazrul Islam wrote poems in [0]'s honor.The Twelfth International Women Conference was held in Istanbul, Turkey on 18 April 1935, and Egyptian nationalist-feminist Huda Sha'arawi was elected by The Twelfth International Women Conference as the vice-president of the International Women's Union. Egyptian nationalist-feminist Huda Sha'arawi considered [0] as a role model for Egyptian nationalist-feminist Huda Sha'arawi's actions and wrote in Egyptian nationalist-feminist Huda Sha'arawi's memoirs:  After The Twelfth International Women Conference ended, we received an invitation to attend the celebration held by [0] Turkey ... and Egyptian nationalist-feminist Huda Sha'arawi said: If the Turks considered [0] the worthiness of the Turks's and the Turks called [0] Atat\u00fcrk, Egyptian nationalist-feminist Huda Sha'arawi say that this is not enough, but [0] are for us \"Atasharq\" [Father of the East]. Its meaning did not come from any female head of delegation, and thanked Egyptian nationalist-feminist Huda Sha'arawi very much for the great influence, and then Egyptian nationalist-feminist Huda Sha'arawi begged [0] to present we with a picture of [0] for publication in the journal L'\u00c9gyptienne. However, [0]'s acclaim is not universal. As the leader of the national movement of 1919\u20131923, [0] was described by the Allies and Istanbul journalist Ali Kemal (who believed the liberation efforts would fail and cause a more severe punishment by the Allies) as a \"bandit chief\". Lord Balfour in this context called [0] the \"most terrible of all the terrible Turks\".", "": ""}}
