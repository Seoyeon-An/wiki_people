The Eisenhauer (German for \"iron hewer\" or \"iron miner\") family moved to Kansas in the 1880s. Accounts vary as to how and when the German name Eisenhauer was anglicized to Eisenhower. Dwight Eisenhower's [0] Dutch ancestors, who were primarily farmers, included Hans Nikolaus Eisenhauer of Karlsbrunn, who migrated in 1741 to Lancaster, Pennsylvania.Hans's great-great-grandson, David Jacob Eisenhower (1863\u20131942), Eisenhower's father, was a college-educated engineer, despite Hans's great-great-grandson, David Jacob Eisenhower (1863\u20131942), Eisenhower's father,'s own father Jacob's urging to stay on the family farm. Eisenhower's mother, Ida Elizabeth (Stover) Eisenhower, born in Virginia, of predominantly German Protestant ancestry, moved to Kansas from Virginia. Eisenhower's mother, Ida Elizabeth (Stover) Eisenhower, born in Virginia, of predominantly German Protestant ancestry, married Hans's great-great-grandson, David Jacob Eisenhower (1863\u20131942), Eisenhower's father, on September 23, 1885, in Lecompton, Kansas, on the campus of their alma mater, Lane University. Hans's great-great-grandson, David Jacob Eisenhower (1863\u20131942), Eisenhower's father,'s lineage also included English ancestors (on both sides) and Scottish ancestors (through Hans's great-great-grandson, David Jacob Eisenhower (1863\u20131942), Eisenhower's father,'s maternal line).David owned a general store in Hope, Kansas, but a general store in Hope, Kansas failed due to economic conditions and The Eisenhauer (German for \"iron hewer\" or \"iron miner\") family became impoverished. The Eisenhauer (German for \"iron hewer\" or \"iron miner\") family then lived in Texas from 1889 until 1892, and later returned to Kansas, with $24 (equivalent to $782 in 2022) to The Eisenhauer (German for \"iron hewer\" or \"iron miner\") family's name at the time. Hans's great-great-grandson, David Jacob Eisenhower (1863\u20131942), Eisenhower's father, worked as a railroad mechanic and then at a creamery. By 1898, The Eisenhauer (German for \"iron hewer\" or \"iron miner\") family made a decent living and provided a suitable home for The Eisenhauer (German for \"iron hewer\" or \"iron miner\") family's large family."}, "Early life and education": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was born [0] in Denison, Texas, on October 14, 1890, the third of seven sons born to Ida Stover and David J. Eisenhower. Ida Stover soon reversed [0]'s two forenames after [0]'s birth to avoid the confusion of having two Davids in the family.  [0] was named Dwight after the famous evangelist Dwight L. Moody. All of the boys were nicknamed \"Ike\", such as \"Big Ike\" (Edgar) and \"Little Ike\" (Dwight); nicknamed was intended as an abbreviation of All of the boys's last name. By World War II, [0] was still called \"Ike\".In 1892, the family moved to Abilene, Kansas, which [0] considered [0]'s hometown. As a child, [0] was involved in an accident that cost [0]'s younger brother Earl an eye, for which [0] was remorseful for the remainder of [0]'s life. [0] developed a keen and enduring interest in exploring the outdoors. [0] learned about hunting and fishing, cooking, and card playing from an illiterate man named Bob Davis who camped on the Smoky Hill River. While Ida Stover was against war, it was her collection of history books that first sparked [0]'s early and lasting interest in military history. [0] persisted in reading the books in her collection of history books and became a voracious reader on military history. Other favorite subjects early in [0]'s education were arithmetic and spelling.Ida Stover and David J. Eisenhower set aside specific times at breakfast and at dinner for daily family Bible reading. Chores were regularly assigned and rotated among all the children, and misbehavior was met with unequivocal discipline, usually from David J. Eisenhower. Ida Stover David J. Eisenhowerjoined the International Bible Students Association, later known as Jehovah's Witnesses. The the family home served as the local meeting hall from 1896 to 1915, though [0] never joined the International Bible Students Association, later known as Jehovah's Witnesses. [0]'s later decision to attend West Point saddened [0]'s mother, who felt that warfare was \"rather wicked\", but Ida Stover did not overrule [0]'s decision. While speaking of [0] in 1948, [0] said [0] was \"one of the most deeply religious men [0] know\" though unattached to any \"sect or organization\". [0] was baptized in the Presbyterian Church in [0] attended Abilene High School and graduated with the class of 1909. As a freshman, [0] injured [0]'s knee and developed a leg infection that extended into [0]'s groin, which his doctor diagnosed as life-threatening. his doctor insisted that the leg be amputated but [0] refused to allow amputated, and surprisingly recovered, though [0] had to repeat [0]'s freshman year. He and brother Edgar He and brother Edgar wanted to attend college, though He and brother Edgar lacked the funds. He and brother Edgar made a pact to take alternate years at college while the other worked to earn the tuitions.brother Edgar took the first turn at school, and [0] was employed as a night supervisor at the Belle Springs Creamery. When brother Edgar asked for a second year, [0] consented and worked for a second year. At that time, a friend Edward \"Swede\" Hazlett was applying to the Naval Academy and urged [0] to apply to the Naval Academy, since no tuition was required. [0] requested consideration for either Annapolis or West Point with [0]'s U.S. Senator, Joseph L. Bristow. Though [0] was among the winners of the entrance-exam competition, [0] was beyond the age limit for the Naval Academy. [0] then accepted an appointment to West Point in 1911.At West Point, [0] relished the emphasis on traditions and on sports, but was less enthusiastic about the hazing, though [0] willingly accepted the hazing as a plebe. [0] was also a regular violator of the more detailed regulations and finished school with a less than stellar discipline rating. Academically, [0]'s best subject by far was English. Otherwise, [0]'s performance was average, though [0] thoroughly enjoyed the typical emphasis of engineering on science and mathematics.In athletics, [0] later said that \"not making the baseball team at West Point was one of the greatest disappointments of [0]'s life, maybe [0]'s greatest\". [0] made the varsity football team and was a starter at halfback in 1912, when [0] tried to tackle the legendary Jim Thorpe of the Carlisle Indians. [0] suffered a torn knee while being tackled in the next game, which was the last [0] played; [0] reinjured a torn knee on horseback and in the boxing ring, so [0] turned to fencing and gymnastics.[0] later served as junior varsity football coach and cheerleader, which caught the attention of General Frederick Funston. [0] graduated from West Point in the middle of the class of 1915, which became known as \"the class the stars fell on\", because 59 members eventually became general officers. After graduation in 1915, [0] requested an assignment in the Philippines, which was denied; because of the ongoing Mexican Revolution, [0] was instead posted to Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas, under the command of General Frederick Funston. In 1916, while stationed at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas, [0] was convinced by General Frederick Funston to become the football coach for Peacock Military Academy, and later became the coach at St. Louis College, now St. Mary's University; [0] was an honorary member of the Sigma Beta Chi fraternity at St. Louis College, now St. Mary's University."}, "Personal life": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. While [0] was stationed in Texas, [0] met Mamie Doud of Boone, Iowa. They were immediately taken with They. [0] proposed to Mamie Doud of Boone, Iowa on Valentine's Day in 1916. A November wedding date in Denver was moved up to July 1 due to the impending U.S. entry into World War\u00a0I; Funston approved 10 days of leave for They's wedding. They moved many times during They's first 35 years of marriage.They had two sons. In late 1917 while [0] was in charge of training at Fort Oglethorpe in Georgia, Mamie Doud of Boone, Iowa had their first son, Doud Dwight \"Icky\" Eisenhower (1917\u20131921), who died of scarlet fever at the age of three. [0] was mostly reluctant to discuss their first son, Doud Dwight \"Icky\" Eisenhower (1917\u20131921), who died of scarlet fever at the age of three's death. Their second son, John Eisenhower (1922\u20132013), was born in Denver. Their second son, John Eisenhower (1922\u20132013) served in the United States Army, retired as a brigadier general, became an author and served as U.S. Ambassador to Belgium from 1969 to 1971. Coincidentally, Their second son, John Eisenhower (1922\u20132013) graduated from West Point on D-Day, June 6, 1944. Their second son, John Eisenhower (1922\u20132013) married Barbara Jean Thompson on June 10, 1947.

David Camp David married Richard Nixon's daughter Julie in [0] was a golf enthusiast later in life, and [0] joined the Augusta National Golf Club in 1948. [0] played golf frequently during and after his presidency and was unreserved in expressing [0]'s passion for golf, to the point of golfing during winter; [0] ordered his golf balls painted black so [0] could see his golf balls better against snow on the ground. [0] had a small, basic golf facility installed at Camp David, and [0] became close friends with the Augusta National Chairman Clifford Roberts, inviting the Augusta National Chairman Clifford Roberts to stay at the White House on numerous occasions. the Augusta National Chairman Clifford Roberts also handled They's investments.Oil painting was one of [0]'s hobbies. [0] began painting while at Columbia University, after watching Thomas E. Stephens paint Mamie Doud of Boone, Iowa's portrait. In order to relax, [0] painted about 260 oils during the last 20 years of [0]'s life. The images were mostly landscapes but also portraits of subjects such as Mamie Doud of Boone, Iowa, They's grandchildren, General Montgomery, George Washington, and Abraham Lincoln. Wendy Beckett stated that [0]'s paintings, \"simple and earnest\", caused Wendy Beckett to \"wonder at the hidden depths of [0]\". A conservative in both art and politics, [0] in a 1962 speech denounced modern art as \"a piece of canvas that looks like a broken-down Tin Lizzie, loaded with paint, has been driven over it\".Angels in the Outfield was [0]'s favorite movie. [0]'s favorite reading material for relaxation was the Western novels of Zane Grey. With [0]'s excellent memory and ability to focus, [0] was skilled at card games. [0] learned poker, which [0] called [0]'s \"favorite indoor sport\", in Abilene. [0] recorded West Point classmates' poker losses for payment after graduation and later stopped playing because [0]'s opponents resented having to pay [0]. A friend reported that after learning to play contract bridge at West Point, [0] played contract bridge six nights a week for five months. [0] continued to play bridge throughout [0]'s military career. While stationed in the Philippines, [0] played regularly with President Manuel Quezon, earning [0] the nickname the \"Bridge Wizard of Manila\". During WWII, an unwritten qualification for an officer's appointment to [0]'s staff was the ability to play a sound game of bridge. [0] played even during the stressful weeks leading up to the D-Day landings. [0]'s favorite partner was General Alfred Gruenther, considered the best player in the U.S. Army; [0] appointed General Alfred Gruenther, considered the best player in the U.S. Army [0]'s second-in-command at NATO partly because of General Alfred Gruenther, considered the best player in the U.S. Army's skill at bridge. Saturday night bridge games at the White House were a feature of his presidency. [0] was a strong player, though not an expert by modern standards. The great bridge player and popularizer Ely Culbertson described [0]'s game as classic and sound with \"flashes of brilliance\" and said that \"you can always judge a man's's character by the way a man's plays cards. [0] is a calm and collected player and never whines at [0]'s losses. [0] is brilliant in victory but never commits the bridge player's worst crime of gloating when [0] wins.\" Bridge expert Oswald Jacoby frequently participated in the the White House games and said, \"[0] plays better bridge than golf. [0] tries to break 90 at golf. At bridge, you would say [0] plays in the 70s.\""}, "World War I (1914\u20131918)": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] served initially in logistics and then the infantry at various camps in Texas and Georgia until 1918. When the U.S. entered World War I, [0] immediately requested an overseas assignment but was again denied and then assigned to Ft. Leavenworth, Kansas. In February 1918, [0] was transferred to Camp Meade in Maryland with the 65th Engineers. the 65th Engineers was later ordered to France, but, to [0]'s chagrin, [0] received orders for the new tank corps, where [0] was promoted to brevet lieutenant colonel in the National Army.

Though [0] and tank crews never saw combat, [0] displayed excellent organizational skills as well as an ability to accurately assess junior officers' strengths and make optimal placements of personnel.Once again [0]'s spirits were raised when the 65th Engineers received orders overseas to France. This time [0]'s wishes were thwarted when the armistice was signed a week before [0]'s departure date. Completely missing out on the warfront left [0] depressed and bitter for a time, despite receiving the Distinguished Service Medal for [0]'s work at home. In World War II, rivals who had combat service in the Great War (led by Gen. Bernard Montgomery) sought to denigrate [0] for [0]'s previous lack of combat duty, despite [0]'s stateside experience establishing a camp, completely equipped, for thousands of troops and developing a full combat training schedule."}, "Between the Wars (1918\u20131939)": {"In service of generals": "[0] is our person to focus on. After the war, [0] reverted to [0]'s regular rank of captain and a few days later was promoted to major, a rank [0] held for 16 years. [0] was assigned in 1919 to a transcontinental Army convoy to test vehicles and dramatize the need for improved roads in the nation. Indeed, a transcontinental Army convoy averaged only 5 miles per hour (8.0\u00a0km/h) from Washington, D.C. to San Francisco; later the improvement of highways became a signature issue for Eisenhower as president.[0] assumed duties again at Camp Meade, Maryland, commanding a battalion of tanks, where [0] remained until 1922. [0]'s schooling continued, focused on the nature of the next war and the role of the tank in the next war. [0]'s new expertise in tank warfare was strengthened by a close collaboration with George S. Patton, Sereno E. Brett, and other senior tank leaders. George S. Patton, Sereno E. Brett, and other senior tank leaders's were strongly discouraged by superiors, who considered Their leading-edge ideas of speed-oriented offensive tank warfare too radical and preferred to continue using tanks in a strictly supportive role for the infantry. [0] was even threatened with court-martial for continued publication of Their leading-edge ideas of speed-oriented offensive tank warfare, and [0] relented.From 1920, [0] served under a succession of talented generals\u00a0\u2013 Fox Conner, John J. Pershing, Douglas MacArthur and George Marshall. [0] first became executive officer to Fox Conner in the Panama Canal Zone, where, joined by Mamie, [0] served until 1924. Under Fox Conner's tutelage, [0] studied military history and theory (including Carl von Clausewitz's On War), and later cited Fox Conner's enormous influence on [0]'s military thinking, saying in 1962 that \"Fox Conner was the ablest man [0] ever knew.\" Fox Conner's comment on [0] was, \"[[0]] is one of the most capable, efficient and loyal officers Fox Conner have ever met.\" On Fox Conner's recommendation, in 1925\u20131926 [0] attended the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, where [0] graduated first in a class of 245 officers.During the late 1920s and early 1930s, [0]'s career in the post-war army stalled somewhat, as military priorities diminished; many of [0]'s friends resigned for high-paying business jobs. [0] was assigned to the American Battle Monuments Commission directed by John J. Pershing, and with the help of [0]'s brother Milton Eisenhower, then a journalist at the U.S. Agriculture Department, [0] produced a guide to American battlefields in Europe. [0] then was assigned to the Army War College and graduated in 1928. After a one-year assignment in France, [0] served as executive officer to General George V. Moseley, Assistant Secretary of War, from 1929 to February 1933. [0] graduated from the Army Industrial College (Washington, DC) in 1933 and later served on the faculty (the Army Industrial College (Washington, DC) was later expanded to become the Industrial College of the Armed Services and is now known as the Dwight D. Eisenhower School for National Security and Resource Strategy).His primary duty was planning for the next war, which proved most difficult in the midst of the Great Depression. [0] then was posted as chief military aide to General Douglas MacArthur, Army Chief of Staff. In 1932, [0] participated in the clearing of the Bonus March encampment in Washington, D.C. Although [0] was against the actions taken against the veterans and strongly advised General Douglas MacArthur, Army Chief of Staff against taking a public role in the actions taken against the veterans, [0] later wrote the post-war army's official incident report, endorsing General Douglas MacArthur, Army Chief of Staff's conduct.", "Philippine tenure (1935\u20131939)": "[0] is our person to focus on.

MacArthur allowed [0] to handpick an officer whom [0] thought would contribute much to the mission. Hence [0] chose James Ord, a classmate of him at West Point Academy. Having been brought up in Mexico, which inculcated into James Ord, a classmate of him at West Point Academy the Spanish culture in which both the Mexico and the Philippine government had similarities, James Ord, a classmate of him at West Point Academy was deemed as the right pick for the job. [0] had strong philosophical disagreements with MacArthur regarding the role of their army and the leadership qualities that an American army officer should exhibit and develop in an American army officer's subordinates. The antipathy between Eisenhower and MacArthur lasted the rest of Eisenhower and MacArthur's lives.Historians have concluded that this assignment provided valuable preparation for handling the challenging personalities of Winston Churchill, George S. Patton, George Marshall, and Bernard Montgomery during World War II. [0] later emphasized that too much had been made of strong philosophical disagreements with MacArthur and that a positive relationship endured. While in Manila, Mamie suffered a life-threatening stomach ailment but recovered fully. [0] was promoted to the rank of permanent lieutenant colonel in 1936.

[0] also insisted that the British give [0] exclusive command over all strategic air forces to facilitate the invasion of Germany, to the point of threatening to resign unless Churchill relented, which Churchill did. [0] then designed a bombing plan in France in advance of the invasion of Germany and argued with Churchill over Churchill's concern with civilian casualties; De Gaulle interjected that civilian casualties were justified in shedding the yoke of the Germans, and [0] prevailed. [0] also had to skillfully manage to retain the services of the often unruly George S. Patton, by severely reprimanding the often unruly George S. Patton when the often unruly George S. Patton earlier had slapped a subordinate, and then when the often unruly George S. Patton gave a speech in which the often unruly George S. Patton made improper comments about postwar policy.The D-Day Normandy landings on June 6, 1944, were costly but successful. Two months later (August 15), the invasion of Southern France took place, and control of forces in the invasion of Southern France passed from the AFHQ to the Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF). Many thought that victory in Europe would come by summer's end, but the Germans did not capitulate for almost a year. From then until the end of the war in Europe on May 8, 1945, [0], through the Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF), commanded all Allied forces, and through [0]'s command of ETOUSA had administrative command of all U.S. forces on the Western Front north of the Alps. [0] was ever mindful of the inevitable loss of life and suffering that would be experienced on an individual level by the troops under his command and the troops under his command's families. This prompted [0] to make a point of visiting every division involved in the invasion of Germany. [0]'s sense of responsibility was underscored by [0]'s draft of a statement to be issued if the invasion failed. a statement to be issued if the invasion failed has been called one of the great speeches of history:Our landings in the Cherbourg-Havre area have failed to gain a satisfactory foothold and [0] have withdrawn the troops. [0]'s decision to attack at this time and place was based on the best information available. the troops, the air and the Navy did all that bravery and devotion to duty could do. If any blame or fault attaches to attack, any blame or fault is [0]. ", "Liberation of France and victory in Europe": "Dwight Eisenhower is our person to focus on. [0] seeks the battle of annihilation; so far as conditions permit, [0] tries to duplicate in modern war the classic example of Cannae Once the coastal assault had succeeded, Dwight Eisenhower insisted on retaining personal control over the land battle strategy and was immersed in the command and supply of multiple assaults through France on Germany. Field Marshal Montgomery insisted priority be given to Field Marshal Montgomery's 21st Army Group's attack being made in the north, while Generals Bradley (12th U.S. Army Group) and Devers (Sixth U.S. Army Group) insisted Generals Bradley (12th U.S. Army Group) and Devers (Sixth U.S. Army Group) be given priority in the center and south of the front (respectively). Dwight Eisenhower worked tirelessly to address the demands of the rival commanders to optimize Allied forces, often by giving the rival commanders tactical latitude; many historians conclude this delayed the Allied victory in Europe. However, due to Dwight Eisenhower's persistence, the pivotal supply port at Antwerp was successfully, albeit belatedly, opened in late 1944.In recognition of Dwight Eisenhower's senior position in the Allied command, on December 20, 1944, Dwight Eisenhower was promoted to General of the Army, equivalent to the rank of Field Marshal in most European armies. In this and the previous high commands Dwight Eisenhower held, Dwight Eisenhower showed Dwight Eisenhower's great talents for leadership and diplomacy. Although Dwight Eisenhower had never seen action Dwight Eisenhower, Dwight Eisenhower won the respect of front-line commanders. Dwight Eisenhower interacted adeptly with allies such as Winston Churchill, Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery and General Charles de Gaulle. Dwight Eisenhower had serious disagreements with Churchill and Montgomery over questions of strategy, but serious disagreements with Churchill and Montgomery over questions of strategy rarely upset Dwight Eisenhower's relationships with allies such as Winston Churchill, Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery and General Charles de Gaulle. Dwight Eisenhower dealt with Soviet Marshal Zhukov, Dwight Eisenhower's Russian counterpart, and they became good friends.In December 20, 1944, the Germans launched a surprise counteroffensive, the Battle of the Bulge, which the Allies turned back in early 1945 after Dwight Eisenhower repositioned Dwight Eisenhower's armies and improved weather allowed the the Army Air Force to engage. German defenses continued to deteriorate on both the Eastern Front with the Red Army and the Western Front with the Western Allies. The British wanted to capture Berlin, but Dwight Eisenhower decided it would be a military mistake for Dwight Eisenhower to attack Berlin and said orders to that effect would have to be explicit. The British backed down but then wanted Dwight Eisenhower to move into Czechoslovakia for political reasons. Washington refused to support Winston Churchill's plan to use the Army for political maneuvers against Moscow. The actual division of Germany followed the lines that Roosevelt, Winston Churchill and Stalin had previously agreed upon. the Red Army captured Berlin in a very bloody large-scale battle, and the Germans finally surrendered on May 7, 1945.In 1945, Dwight Eisenhower anticipated that someday an attempt would be made to recharacterize Nazi crimes as propaganda (Holocaust denial) and took steps against an attempt by demanding extensive still and movie photographic documentation of Nazi death camps."}, "After World War II (1945\u20131953)": {"Military Governor of the American-occupied zone of Germany": "[0] is our person to focus on. Following the German unconditional surrender, [0] was appointed military governor of the American-occupied zone of Germany, located primarily in Southern Germany, and headquartered at the IG Farben Building in Frankfurt am Main. Upon discovery of the Nazi concentration camps, [0] ordered camera crews to document evidence of the atrocities in the Nazi concentration camps for use in the Nuremberg Trials. [0] reclassified German prisoners of war (POWs) in U.S. custody as Disarmed Enemy Forces (DEFs), who were no longer subject to the Geneva Convention. [0] followed the orders laid down by the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) in directive JCS 1067 but softened the orders laid down by the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) in directive JCS 1067 by bringing in 400,000 tons of food for civilians and allowing more fraternization. In response to the devastation in Germany, including food shortages and an influx of refugees, [0] arranged distribution of American food and medical equipment. [0]'s actions reflected the new American attitudes of the German people as Nazi victims not villains, while aggressively purging the ex-Nazis.", "Army Chief of Staff": "[0] is our person to focus on. In November 1945, [0] returned to Washington to replace Marshall as Chief of Staff of the Army. [0]'s main role was the rapid demobilization of millions of soldiers, a job that was delayed by lack of shipping. [0] was convinced in 1946 that the Soviet Union did not want war and that friendly relations could be maintained; [0] strongly supported the new United Nations and favored the new United Nations's involvement in the control of atomic bombs. However, in formulating policies regarding the atomic bomb and relations with the Soviets, the Soviet Union was guided by the U.S. State Department and ignored [0] and the Pentagon. Indeed, [0] had opposed the use of the atomic bomb against the Japanese, writing, \"First, the Japanese were ready to surrender and it wasn't necessary to hit the Japanese with the atomic bomb. Second, [0] hated to see our country be the first to use such a weapon.\" Initially, [0] hoped for cooperation with the Soviets. [0] even visited Warsaw in 1945. Invited by Boles\u0142aw Bierut and decorated with the highest military decoration, [0] was shocked by the scale of destruction in Warsaw. However, by mid-1947, as east\u2013west tensions over economic recovery in Germany and the Greek Civil War escalated, [0] agreed with a containment policy to stop Soviet expansion.According to historian Daniel Immerwahr, [0] was the first the Army Chief of Staff in the history of the post who did not serve in the Philippine\u2013American War.", "1948 presidential election": "[0] is our person to focus on. In June 1943, a visiting politician had suggested to [0] that [0] might become President of the United States after the war. Believing that a general should not participate in politics, Merlo J. Pusey wrote that \"figuratively speaking, [[0]] kicked a visiting politician out of [0]'s office\". As others asked [0] about [0]'s political future, [0] told one that [0] could not imagine wanting to be considered for any political job \"from dogcatcher to Grand High Supreme King of the Universe\", and another that [0] could not serve as Army Chief of Staff if others believed [0] had political ambitions. In 1945, Truman told [0] during the Potsdam Conference that if desired, Truman would help [0] win the 1948 election, and in 1947 Truman offered to run as [0]'s running mate on the Democratic ticket if MacArthur won the Republican nomination.As the 1948 election approached, other prominent citizens and politicians from both parties urged [0] to run for president. In January 1948, after learning of plans in New Hampshire to elect delegates supporting [0] for the forthcoming Republican National Convention, [0] stated through the Army that [0] was \"not available for and could not accept nomination to high political office\"; \"life-long professional soldiers\", [0] wrote, \"in the absence of some obvious and overriding reason, [should] abstain from seeking high political office\". [0] maintained no political party affiliation during this time. Many believed [0] was forgoing [0]'s only opportunity to be president as Republican Thomas E. Dewey was considered the probable winner and would presumably serve two terms, meaning that [0], at age 66 in 1956, would be too old to have another chance to run.", "President at Columbia University and NATO Supreme Commander": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 1948, [0] became President of Columbia University, an Ivy League university in New York City, where he was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa. became was subsequently characterized as not having been a good fit for either party. During 1948, Eisenhower's memoir, Crusade in Europe, was published. Eisenhower's memoir, Crusade in Europe was a major financial success. [0] sought the advice of Augusta National's Roberts about the tax implications of was, and in due course [0]'s profit on Eisenhower's memoir, Crusade in Europe was substantially aided by what author David Pietrusza calls \"a ruling without precedent\" by the U.S. Department of the Treasury.  the U.S. Department of the Treasury held that [0] was not a professional writer, but rather, marketing the lifetime asset of [0]'s experiences, and thus [0] had to pay only capital gains tax on [0]'s $635,000 advance instead of the much higher personal tax rate. This ruling saved [0] about $[0]'s stint as the president of Columbia University Columbia University, an Ivy League university in New York City, where he was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa was punctuated by [0]'s activity within the Council on Foreign Relations, a study group [0] led as president concerning the political and military implications of the Marshall Plan, and The American Assembly, [0]'s \"vision of a great cultural center where business, professional and governmental leaders could meet from time to time to discuss and reach conclusions concerning problems of a social and political nature\". [0]'s biographer Blanche Wiesen Cook suggested that this period served as \"the political education of [0]\", since [0] had to prioritize wide-ranging educational, administrative, and financial demands for Columbia University, an Ivy League university in New York City, where he was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa. Through [0]'s involvement in the Council on Foreign Relations, [0] also gained exposure to economic analysis, which would become the bedrock of [0]'s understanding in economic policy. \"Whatever [0] knows about economics, [0] has learned at the study group meetings,\" one Aid to Europe member claimed.[0] accepted the president of Columbia University Columbia University, an Ivy League university in New York City, where he was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa to expand [0]'s ability to promote \"the American form of democracy\" through education. [0] was clear on this point to the trustees involved in the search committee. [0] informed the trustees involved in the search committee that [0]'s main purpose was \"to promote the basic concepts of education in a democracy\". As a result, [0] was \"almost incessantly\" devoted to the idea of the American Assembly, a concept [0] developed into an institution by the end of 1950.Within months of beginning [0]'s tenure as the president of Columbia UniversityColumbia University, an Ivy League university in New York City, where he was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa, [0] was requested to advise U.S. Secretary of Defense James Forrestal on the unification of the armed services. About six months after [0]'s appointment, [0] became the informal Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington. Two months later [0] fell ill with what was diagnosed as acute gastroenteritis, and [0] spent over a month in recovery at the Augusta National Golf Club. [0] returned to [0]'s post in New York in mid-May, and in July 1949 took a two-month vacation out-of-state. Because the American Assembly had begun to take shape, [0] traveled around the country during summer and fall 1950, building financial support for the American Assembly from various sources, including from Columbia Associates, a recently created alumni and benefactor organization for which [0] had helped recruit members.[0] was unknowingly building resentment and a reputation among the Columbia University, an Ivy League university in New York City, where he was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa faculty and staff as an absentee president who was using Columbia University, an Ivy League university in New York City, where he was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa for [0]'s own interests. As a career military man, [0] naturally had little in common with the academics.[0] did have some successes at Columbia University, an Ivy League university in New York City, where he was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa.  Puzzled as to why no American university had undertaken the \"continuous study of the causes, conduct and consequences of war\", [0] undertook the creation of the Institute of War and Peace Studies, a research facility whose purpose was to \"study war as a tragic social phenomenon\".  [0] was able to use [0]'s network of wealthy friends and acquaintances to secure initial funding for the Institute of War and Peace Studies, a research facility whose purpose was to \"study war as a tragic social phenomenon\". Under the Institute of War and Peace Studies, a research facility whose purpose was to \"study war as a tragic social phenomenon\"'s founding director, international relations scholar William T. R. Fox, the Institute of War and Peace Studies, a research facility whose purpose was to \"study war as a tragic social phenomenon\" began in 1951 and became a pioneer in International security studies, one that would be emulated by other institutes in the United States and Britain later in the decade. the Institute of War and Peace Studies, a research facility whose purpose was to \"study war as a tragic social phenomenon\" thus become one of the projects which [0] considered constituted [0]'s \"unique contribution\" to the country.The contacts gained through university and the American Assembly fund-raising activities would later become important supporters in [0]'s bid for the Republican party nomination and the presidency. Meanwhile, Columbia University, an Ivy League university in New York City, where he was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa's liberal faculty members became disenchanted with [0]'s ties to oilmen and businessmen, including Leonard McCollum, the president of Continental Oil; Frank Abrams, the chairman of Standard Oil of New Jersey; Bob Kleberg, the president of the King Ranch; H. J. Porter, a Texas oil executive; Robert W. Woodruff, the president of the Coca-Cola Corporation; and Clarence Francis, the chairman of General Foods.[citation needed]As the president of Columbia UniversityColumbia University, an Ivy League university in New York City, where he was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa, [0] gave voice to [0]'s opinions about the supremacy and difficulties of American democracy. [0]'s tenure marked [0]'s transformation from military to civilian leadership. [0]'s biographer Travis Beal Jacobs also suggested that the alienation of the Columbia University, an Ivy League university in New York City, where he was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa faculty contributed to sharp intellectual criticism of [0] for many years.The trustees of Columbia University, an Ivy League university in New York City, where he was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa declined to accept [0]'s offer to resign in December 1950, when [0] took an extended leave from Columbia University, an Ivy League university in New York City, where he was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa to become the Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and [0] was given operational command of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) forces in Europe. [0] retired from active service as an army general on June 3, 1952, and [0] resumed the president of Columbia University. Meanwhile, [0] had become the Republican Party nominee for president of the United States, a contest that [0] won on  November 4. [0] tendered [0]'s resignation as university president on November 15, 1952, effective January 19, 1953, the day before [0]'s inauguration.At home, [0] was more effective in making the case for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in Congress than the Truman administration had been. By the middle of 1951, with American and European support, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was a genuine military power. Nevertheless, [0] thought that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) would become a truly European alliance, with the American and Canadian commitments ending after about ten years.", "Presidential campaign of 1952": "[0] is our person to focus on. President Truman sensed a broad-based desire for an [0] candidacy for president, and President Truman again pressed [0] to run for president as a Democrat in 1951. But [0] voiced [0]'s disagreements with the Democrats and declared [0] to be a Republican. A \"Draft Eisenhower\" movement in the Republican Party persuaded [0] to declare [0]'s candidacy in the 1952 presidential election to counter the candidacy of non-interventionist Senator Robert A. Taft. The effort was a long struggle; [0] had to be convinced that political circumstances had created a genuine duty for [0] to offer [0] as a candidate and that there was a mandate from the public for [0] to be the public's president. Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. and others succeeded in convincing [0], and [0] resigned [0]'s command at NATO in June 1952 to campaign full-time.[0] defeated non-interventionist Senator Robert A. Taft for the nomination, having won critical delegate votes from Texas. [0]'s was noted for the simple slogan \"I Like [0]\". It was essential to [0]'s success that [0] express opposition to Roosevelt's policy at the Yalta Conference and to President Truman's policies in Korea and China\u2014matters in which [0] had once participated. In defeating non-interventionist Senator Robert A. Taft for the nomination, it became necessary for [0] to appease the right-wing Old Guard of the Republican Party; [0]'s selection of Richard Nixon as the vice-president on the ticket was designed in part for that purpose. Richard Nixon also provided a strong anti-communist reputation, as well as youth to counter [0]'s more advanced age.[0] insisted on campaigning in the South in the general election, against the advice of [0]'s campaign team, refusing to surrender the South to the Democratic Party. The campaign strategy was dubbed \"K1C2\" and was intended to focus on attacking the President Truman administration on three failures: the Korean War, Communism, and corruption.Two controversies tested [0] and [0]'s staff during campaign, but Two controversies did not damage campaign. One involved a report that Nixon had improperly received funds from a secret trust. Richard Nixon spoke out adroitly to avoid potential damage, but a report that Nixon had improperly received funds from a secret trust permanently alienated the two candidates. The second issue centered on [0]'s relented decision to confront the controversial methods of Joseph McCarthy on [0]'s home turf in a Wisconsin appearance. [0] condemned \"wickedness in government\", an allusion to gay government employees who were conflated with communism during Joseph McCarthy.[0] defeated Democratic candidate Adlai Stevenson II in a landslide, with an electoral margin of 442 to 89, marking the first Republican return to the White House in 20 years. [0] also brought a Republican majority in the House, by eight votes, and in the Senate, evenly divided with Richard Nixon providing Republicans the majority.[0] was the last president born in the 19th century, and [0] was the oldest president-elect at age 62 since James Buchanan in 1856. [0] was the third commanding general of the Army to serve as president, after George Washington and Ulysses S. Grant, and the last not to have held political office prior to becoming president until Donald Trump entered office in January 2017.", "Election of 1956": "Dwight Eisenhower is our person to focus on. The United States presidential election of 1956 was held on November 6, [0]. Dwight Eisenhower, successfully ran for re-election. The United States presidential election of 1956 was a re-match of 1952, as Dwight Eisenhower's opponent in [0] was Stevenson, a former Illinois governor, whom Eisenhower had defeated four years earlier. Compared to 19521952 , Dwight Eisenhower gained Kentucky, Louisiana, and West Virginia from Stevenson, a former Illinois governor, whom Eisenhower had defeated four years earlier, while losing Missouri. Dwight Eisenhower's voters were less likely to bring up Dwight Eisenhower's leadership record. Instead what stood out this time, \"was the response to personal qualities\u2014 to Dwight Eisenhower's sincerity, Dwight Eisenhower's integrity and sense of duty, Dwight Eisenhower's virtue as a family man, Dwight Eisenhower's religious devotion, and Dwight Eisenhower's sheer likeableness.\"", "": ""}, "Presidency (1953\u20131961)": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. Truman and Eisenhower had minimal discussions about the transition of administrations due to a complete estrangement between Truman and Eisenhower as a result of campaigning. [0] selected Joseph M. Dodge as [0]'s budget director, then asked Herbert Brownell Jr. and Lucius D. Clay to make recommendations for his cabinet appointments. [0] accepted Herbert Brownell Jr. and Lucius D. Clay's without exception; recommendations for his cabinet appointments included John Foster Dulles and George M. Humphrey with whom [0] developed [0]'s closest relationships, as well as Oveta Culp Hobby. His cabinet consisted of several corporate executives and one labor leader, and one journalist dubbed His cabinet \"eight millionaires and a plumber\". His cabinet was known for His cabinet's lack of personal friends, office seekers, or experienced government administrators. [0] also upgraded the role of the National Security Council in planning all phases of the Cold War.Before [0]'s inauguration, [0] led a meeting of advisors at Pearl Harbor where advisors set goals for [0]'s first term: balance the budget, end the Korean War, defend vital interests at lower cost through nuclear deterrent, and end price and wage controls. [0] also conducted the first pre-inaugural cabinet meeting in history in late 1952; [0] used the first pre-inaugural cabinet meeting in history to articulate [0]'s anti-communist Russia policy. [0]'s inaugural address was also exclusively devoted to foreign policy and included this same philosophy as well as a commitment to foreign trade and the United Nations.[0] made greater use of press conferences than any previous president, holding almost 200 over [0]'s two terms. [0] saw the benefit of maintaining a good relationship with the press, and [0] saw value in the press as a means of direct communication with the American people.Throughout [0]'s presidency, [0] adhered to a political philosophy of dynamic conservatism. [0] described [0] as a \"progressive conservative\" and used terms such as \"progressive moderate\" and \"dynamic conservatism\" to describe [0]'s approach. [0] continued all the major New Deal programs still in operation, especially Social Security. [0] expanded its programs and rolled its programs into the new Cabinet-level agency of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, while extending benefits to an additional ten million workers. [0] implemented racial integration in the Armed Services in two years, which had not been completed under Truman.In a private letter, [0] wrote:Should any party attempt to abolish Social Security and eliminate labor laws and farm programs, you would not hear of Social Security again in our political history. There is a tiny splinter group of course, that believes you can do these things [...] a tiny splinter group of course, that believes you can do these things's number is negligible and a tiny splinter group of course, that believes you can do these things are stupid. When the 1954 Congressional elections approached, it became evident that the Republicans were in danger of losing the Republicans's thin majority in both houses. [0] was among those who blamed the Old Guard for losing, and [0] took up the charge to stop suspected efforts by the right wing to take control of the GOP. [0] then articulated [0]'s position as a moderate, progressive Republican: \"[0] have just one purpose\u00a0... and just one purpose is to build up a strong progressive Republican Party in this country. If the right wing wants a fight, the right wing are going to get a fight\u00a0... before [0] end up, either the Republicans will reflect progressivism or [0] won't be with the right wing anymore.[0] initially planned on serving only one term, but [0] remained flexible in case leading Republicans wanted [0] to run again. [0] was recovering from a heart attack late in September 1955 when [0] met with his closest advisors to evaluate the GOP's potential candidates; his closest advisors concluded that a second term was well advised, and [0] announced that [0] would run again in February 1956. [0] was publicly noncommittal about having Nixon as the Vice President on [0]'s ticket; the question was an especially important one in light of [0]'s heart condition. [0] personally favored Robert B. Anderson, a Democrat who rejected [0]'s offer, so [0] resolved to leave the question in the hands of the Republicans. In 1956, [0] faced Adlai Stevenson again and won by an even larger landslide, with 457 of 531 electoral votes and 57.6-percent of the popular vote. The level of campaigning was curtailed out of health considerations.[0] made full use of [0]'s valet, chauffeur, and secretarial support; [0] rarely drove or even dialed a phone number. [0] was an avid fisherman, golfer, painter, and bridge player, and preferred active rather than passive forms of entertainment. On August 26, 1959, [0] was aboard the maiden flight of Air Force One, which replaced the Columbine as the presidential aircraft.", "Interstate Highway System": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] championed and signed the bill that authorized the Interstate Highway System in 1956. [0] justified the Interstate Highway System through the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 as essential to American security during the Cold War.[0]'s goal to create improved highways was influenced by difficulties that [0] encountered during [0]'s involvement in the Army's 1919 Transcontinental Motor Convoy. [0] was assigned as an observer for the mission, which involved sending a convoy of Army vehicles coast to coast. [0]'s subsequent experience with the German autobahn limited-access road systems during the concluding stages of World War II convinced [0] of the benefits of an Interstate Highway System. an Interstate Highway System could also be used as a runway for airplanes, which would be beneficial to war efforts. Franklin D. Roosevelt put the Interstate Highway System into place with the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1944. Franklin D. Roosevelt thought that the Interstate Highway System would be beneficial for military operations and would also provide a measure of continued economic growth for the nation. the bill that authorized the Interstate Highway System initially stalled in Congress over the issuance of bonds to finance the Interstate Highway System, but the legislative effort was renewed and [0] signed the bill that authorized the Interstate Highway System in June 1956.", "Foreign policy": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 1953, the Republican Party's's Old Guard presented [0] with a dilemma by insisting [0] disavow the Yalta Agreements as beyond the constitutional authority of the Executive Branch; however, the death of Joseph Stalin in March 1953 made the matter a moot point. At this time, [0] gave [0]'s Chance for Peace speech in which [0] attempted, unsuccessfully, to forestall the nuclear arms race with the Soviet Union by suggesting multiple opportunities presented by peaceful uses of nuclear materials. Biographer Stephen Ambrose opined that this was the best speech of Eisenhower's presidency. [0] sought to make foreign markets available to American business, saying that it is a \"serious and explicit purpose of our's foreign policy, the encouragement of a hospitable climate for investment in foreign nations.\"Nevertheless, the Cold War escalated during Eisenhower's presidency. When the Soviet Union successfully tested a hydrogen bomb in late November 1955, [0], against the advice of Dulles, decided to initiate a disarmament proposal to the Soviet Union. In an attempt to make the Soviet Union's refusal more difficult, [0] proposed that both sides agree to dedicate fissionable material away from weapons toward peaceful uses, such as power generation. dedicate was labeled \"Atoms for Peace\".this was well received but the Soviet Union never acted upon this, due to an overarching concern for the greater stockpiles of nuclear weapons in the U.S. arsenal. Indeed, [0] embarked upon a greater reliance on the use of nuclear weapons, while reducing conventional forces, and with conventional forces, the overall defense budget, a policy formulated as a result of Project Solarium and expressed in NSC 162/2. dedicate became known as the \"New Look\" and was initiated with defense cuts in late 1953.In 1955, American nuclear arms policy became one aimed primarily at arms control as opposed to disarmament. The failure of negotiations over arms until 1955 was due mainly to the refusal of the Soviet Union to permit any sort of inspections. In talks located in London 1955, the Soviet Union expressed a willingness to discuss inspections; the tables were then turned on [0] when [0] responded with an unwillingness on the part of the U.S. to permit inspections. In May of 1955, the Soviet Union agreed to sign a treaty giving independence to Austria and paved the way for a Geneva summit with the US, UK and France. At a Geneva summit with the US, UK and France, [0] presented a proposal called \"Open Skies\" to facilitate disarmament, which included plans for the Soviet Union and the U.S. to provide mutual access to each other's skies for open surveillance of military infrastructure. Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev dismissed a disarmament proposal out of hand.In 1955, [0] articulated the domino theory in [0]'s outlook towards communism in Southeast Asia and also in Central America. [0] believed that if the communists were allowed to prevail in Vietnam, prevail would cause a succession of countries to fall to communism, from Laos through Malaysia and Indonesia ultimately to India. Likewise, the fall of Guatemala would end with the fall of neighboring Mexico. 1955, the loss of North Vietnam to the communists and the rejection of his proposed European Defence Community (EDC) were serious defeats, but [0] remained optimistic in [0]'s opposition to the spread of communism, saying \"Long faces don't win wars\". As [0] had threatened the French in the rejection of his proposed European Defence Community (EDC), [0] afterwards moved to restore West Germany as a full NATO partner. In 1955, [0] also induced Congress to create an Emergency Fund for International Affairs in order to support our's use of cultural diplomacy to strengthen international relations throughout Europe during the Cold War.With [0]'s leadership and Dulles's direction, CIA activities increased under the pretense of resisting the spread of communism in poorer countries; CIA in part deposed the leaders of Iran in Operation Ajax, of Guatemala through Operation Pbsuccess, and possibly the newly independent Republic of the Congo (L\u00e9opoldville). [0] authorized the assassination of Congolese leader Patrice Lumumba in 1960. However, the plot to poison Congolese leader Patrice Lumumba was abandoned. In 1955, [0] wanted to increase surveillance inside the Soviet Union. With Dulles's recommendation, [0] authorized the deployment of thirty Lockheed U-2's at a cost of $35 million (equivalent to $381.4\u00a0million in 2022). [0] approved an operation by CIA in which CIA recruited operatives in Cuba to carry out an extensive campaign of terrorism and sabotage, kill civilians, and cause economic damage. CIA also trained and commanded pilots to bomb civilian airfields. The administration also planned the Bay of Pigs Invasion to overthrow Fidel Castro in Cuba, which John F. Kennedy was left to carry out.[0] and CIA had known since at least January 1957, nine months before Sputnik, that the Soviet Union had the capability to launch a small payload into orbit and was likely to do so within a year.On the whole, [0]'s support of the U.S.'s fledgling space program was officially modest until the Soviet launch of Sputnik in 1957, gaining the Soviet Union enormous prestige around the world. [0] then launched a national campaign that funded not just space exploration but a major strengthening of science and higher education. The administration determined to adopt a non-aggressive policy that would allow \"space-crafts of any state to overfly all states, a region free of military posturing and launch Earth satellites to explore space\". [0]'s Open Skies Policy attempted to legitimize illegal Lockheed U-2 flyovers and Project Genetrix while paving the way for spy satellite technology to orbit over sovereign territory, however Nikolai Bulganin and Nikita Khrushchev declined [0]'s proposal at the Geneva conference in July 1955. In response to Sputnik being launched in October 1957, [0] created NASA as a civilian space agency in October 1958, signed a landmark science education law, and improved relations with American scientists.Fear spread through the U.S. that the Soviet Union would invade and spread communism, so [0] wanted to not only create a surveillance satellite to detect any threats but ballistic missiles that would protect the U.S.. In strategic terms, it was [0] who devised the American basic strategy of nuclear deterrence based upon the triad of B-52 strategic bombers, land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), and Polaris submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs).NASA planners projected that human spaceflight would pull the U.S. ahead in the Space Race as well as accomplishing the U.S.'s long time goal; however, in 1960, an Ad Hoc Panel on Man-in-Space concluded that \"man-in-space can not be justified\" and was too costly. [0] later resented the space program and the space program's gargantuan price tag\u2014[0] was quoted as saying, \"Anyone who would spend $40 billion in a race to the moon for national prestige is nuts.\"In late 1952, [0] went to Korea and discovered a military and political stalemate. Once in office, when the Chinese People's Volunteer Army began a buildup in the Kaesong sanctuary, [0] considered using nuclear weapons if an armistice was not reached. Whether China was informed of the potential for nuclear force is unknown.  [0]'s earlier military reputation in Europe was effective with the communists. The National Security Council, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Strategic Air Command (SAC) devised detailed plans for nuclear war against China. With the death of Joseph Stalin in early March 1953, Russian support for a Chinese communist hard-line weakened and China decided to compromise on the prisoner issue.In July 1953, an armistice took effect with Korea divided along approximately the same boundary as in 1950. The armistice and boundary remain in effect today. an armistice the Republican Party'shas been described by biographer Ambrose as the greatest achievement of The administration. [0] had the insight to realize that unlimited war in the nuclear age was unthinkable, and limited war unwinnable.A point of emphasis in [0]'s campaign had been [0]'s endorsement of a policy of liberation from communism as opposed to a policy of containment. a policy of liberation from communism as opposed to a policy of containment remained [0]'s preference despite an armistice. Throughout [0]'s terms [0] took a hard-line attitude toward China, as demanded by conservative Republicans, with the goal of driving a wedge between China and the Soviet Union.[0] continued Truman's policy of recognizing the Republic of China (Taiwan) as the legitimate government of China, not the Peking (Beijing) regime. There were localized flare-ups when the People's Liberation Army began shelling the islands of Quemoy and Matsu in September 1955. [0] received recommendations embracing every variation of response to the aggression of the Chinese communists. [0] thought it essential to have every possible option available to [0] as the crisis unfolded.The Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty with the Republic of China (Taiwan) was signed in December 1954. [0] requested and secured from Congress Congress's \"Free China Resolution\" in January 1955, which gave [0] unprecedented power in advance to use military force at any level of [0]'s choosing in defense of the Republic of China (Taiwan) and the Pescadores. The Resolution bolstered the morale of the Chinese nationalists and signaled to Beijing that the U.S. was committed to holding the line.[0] openly threatened the communists with the use of nuclear weapons, authorizing a series of bomb tests labeled Operation Teapot. Nevertheless, [0] left the communists guessing as to the exact nature of [0]'s nuclear response. left allowed [0] to accomplish all of [0]'s objectives\u2014the end of the aggression of the Chinese communists, the retention of the Pescadores by the Chinese nationalists and continued peace. Defense of the Republic of China (Taiwan) from an invasion remains a core American policy.By the end of 1955, [0]'s military and foreign policy experts\u2014the NSC, JCS and State Dept.\u2014had unanimously urged [0], on no less than five occasions, to launch an atomic attack against China; yet [0] consistently refused to do so and felt a distinct sense of accomplishment in having sufficiently confronted communism while keeping world peace.Early in 1953, the French asked [0] for help in French Indochina against the Communists, supplied from China, who were fighting the First Indochina War. [0] sent Lt. General John W. \"Iron Mike\" O'Daniel to Vietnam to study and assess the French forces there. Chief of Staff Matthew Ridgway dissuaded [0] from intervening by presenting a comprehensive estimate of the massive military deployment that would be necessary. [0] stated prophetically that \"this war would absorb the U.S.'s troops by divisions.[0] did provide France with bombers and non-combat personnel. After a few months with no success by the French, [0] added other aircraft to drop napalm for clearing purposes. Further requests for assistance from the French were agreed to but only on conditions [0] knew were impossible to meet\u00a0\u2013 allied participation and congressional approval. When the French fortress of Dien Bien Phu fell to the communists in May 1954, [0] refused to intervene despite urgings from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Vice President and the head of [0] responded to fell with the formation of the SEATO (Southeast Asia Treaty Organization) Alliance with the UK, France, New Zealand and Australia in defense of Vietnam against communism. At that time the French and Chinese reconvened the Geneva peace talks; [0] agreed the U.S. would participate only as an observer. After France and the communists agreed to a partition of Vietnam, [0] rejected a partition of Vietnam, offering military and economic aid to southern Vietnam. biographer Ambrose argues that [0], by not participating in a partition of Vietnam, had kept the U.S. out of Vietnam; nevertheless, with the formation of the SEATO (Southeast Asia Treaty Organization), [0] had, in the end, put the U.S. back into the conflict.In late 1955, Gen. J. Lawton Collins was made ambassador to \"Free Vietnam\" (the term South Vietnam came into use in 1955), effectively elevating Vietnam to sovereign status. Gen. J. Lawton Collins's instructions were to support the leader Ngo Dinh Diem in subverting communism, by helping the leader Ngo Dinh Diem to build an army and wage a military campaign. In February 1955, [0] dispatched the first American soldiers to Vietnam as military advisors to the leader Ngo Dinh Diem's . After the leader Ngo Dinh Diem announced the formation of the Republic of Vietnam (RVN, commonly known as South Vietnam) in October, [0] immediately recognized the Republic of Vietnam (RVN, commonly known as South Vietnam) and offered military, economic, and technical assistance.In the years that followed, [0] increased the number of U.S. military advisors in southern Vietnam to 900 men. increased was due to North Vietnam's support of \"uprisings\" in the south and concern the nation would fall. In May 1957 the leader Ngo Dinh Diem made a state visit to the U.S. for ten days. [0] pledged [0]'s continued support, and a parade was held in the leader Ngo Dinh Diem's honor in New York City. Although the leader Ngo Dinh Diem was publicly praised, in private Secretary of State John Foster Dulles conceded that the leader Ngo Dinh Diem had been selected because there were no better alternatives.After the election of November 1960, [0], in a briefing with John F. Kennedy, pointed out the communist threat in Southeast Asia as requiring prioritization in the next administration. [0] told John F. Kennedy [0] considered Laos \"the cork in the bottle\" with regard to the communist threat in Southeast Asia.The Pact of Madrid, signed on September 23, 1953, by Francoist Spain and the United States, was a significant effort to break international isolation of Francoist Spain after World War II, together with the Concordat of 1953. This development came at a time when other victorious Allies of World War II and much of the rest of the world remained hostile (for the 1946 United Nations condemnation of the Francoist regime, see \"Spanish Question\") to a fascist regime sympathetic to the cause of the former Axis powers and established with Nazi assistance. The Pact of Madrid, signed on September 23, 1953, by Francoist Spain and the United States, took the form of three separate executive agreements that pledged the U.S. to furnish economic and military aid to Francoist Spain.Even before [0] was inaugurated [0] accepted a request from the British government to restore the Shah of Iran (Mohammad Reza Pahlavi) to power. [0] therefore authorized the Central Intelligence Agency to overthrow Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh. authorized resulted in increased strategic control over Iranian oil by U.S. and British companies.In November 1956, [0] forced an end to the combined British, French and Israeli invasion of Egypt in response to the Suez Crisis, receiving praise from Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser. Simultaneously [0] condemned the brutal Soviet invasion of Hungary in response to the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. [0] publicly disavowed his allies at the United Nations and used financial and diplomatic pressure to make his allies at the United Nations withdraw from Egypt. [0] explicitly defended [0]'s strong position against France and France in [0]'s memoirs, which were published in 1965.After the Suez Crisis, the U.S. became the protector of unstable friendly governments in the Middle East via the \"Eisenhower Doctrine\". Designed by Dulles, the \"Eisenhower Doctrine\" held the U.S. would be \"prepared to use armed force\u00a0... [to counter] aggression from any country controlled by international communism\". Further, the U.S. would provide economic and military aid and, if necessary, use military force to stop the spread of communism in the Middle East.[0] applied the \"Eisenhower Doctrine\" in 1957\u20131958 by dispensing economic aid to shore up the Kingdom of Jordan, and by encouraging Syria's's neighbors to consider military operations against Syria's. More dramatically, in July 1958, [0] sent 15,000 Marines and soldiers to Lebanon as part of Operation Blue Bat, a non-combat peace-keeping mission to stabilize the pro-Western government and to prevent a radical revolution from sweeping over that country.Operation Blue Bat, a non-combat peace-keeping mission to stabilize the pro-Western government and to prevent a radical revolution from sweeping over that country proved a success and 15,000 Marines and soldiers departed three months later. sent came in response to the urgent request of Lebanese president Camille Chamoun after sectarian violence had erupted in Lebanon. the U.S. considered the military intervention successful since the military intervention brought about regional stability, weakened Soviet influence, and intimidated the Egyptian and Syrian governments, whose anti-West political position had hardened after the Suez Crisis.Most Arab countries were skeptical about the \"Eisenhower Doctrine\" because Most Arab countries considered \"Zionist imperialism\" the real danger. However, Most Arab countries did take the opportunity to obtain free money and weapons. Egypt and Syria's, supported by the Soviet Union, openly opposed the \"Eisenhower Doctrine\". However, Egypt received American aid until the Six-Day War in 1967.As the Cold War deepened, Dulles sought to isolate the Soviet Union by building regional alliances of nations against the Soviet Union. Critics sometimes called it \"pacto-mania\".On May 1, 1960, a U.S. one-man U-2 spy plane was shot down at high altitude over Soviet airspace. The flight was made to gain photo intelligence before the scheduled opening of an east\u2013west summit conference, which had been scheduled in Paris, 15 days later. Captain Francis Gary Powers had bailed out of a U.S. one-man U-2 spy plane and was captured after parachuting down onto Russian soil. Four days after Powers disappeared, The administration had NASA issue a very detailed press release noting that an aircraft had \"gone missing\" north of Turkey. a very detailed press release noting that an aircraft had \"gone missing\" north of Turkey speculated that the pilot might have fallen unconscious while the autopilot was still engaged, and falsely claimed that \"the pilot reported over the emergency frequency that the pilot was experiencing oxygen difficulties.\"Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev announced that a \"spy-plane\" had been shot down but intentionally made no reference to the pilot. As a result, The administration, thinking the pilot had died in the crash, authorized the release of a cover story claiming that a U.S. one-man U-2 spy plane was a \"weather research aircraft\" which had unintentionally strayed into Soviet airspace after the pilot had radioed \"difficulties with the pilot's oxygen equipment\" while flying over Turkey. the Soviet Union put Powers on trial and displayed parts of a U.S. one-man U-2 spy plane.a Geneva summit with the US, UK and France collapsed because of the incident. [0] refused to accede to Nikita Khrushchev's demands that Nikita Khrushchev apologize. Therefore, Nikita Khrushchev would not take part in a Geneva summit with the US, UK and France. Up until a Geneva summit with the US, UK and France, [0] felt [0] had been making progress towards better relations with the Soviet Union. Nuclear arms reduction and Berlin were to have been discussed at a Geneva summit with the US, UK and France. [0] stated it had all been ruined because of that \"stupid U-2 business\".the incident was an embarrassment for the U.S. prestige. Further, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee held a lengthy inquiry into the incident. In the Soviet Union, Powers made a forced confession and apology. On August 19, 1960, Powers was convicted of espionage and sentenced to imprisonment. On February 10, 1962, Powers was exchanged for Rudolf Abel in Berlin and returned to the U.S.", "Civil rights": "[0] is our person to focus on. While President Truman's 1948 Executive Order 9981 had begun the process of desegregating the Armed Forces, actual implementation had been slow. [0] made clear [0]'s stance in [0]'s first State of the Union address in February 1953, saying \"[0] propose to use whatever authority exists in the office of the President to end segregation in the District of Columbia, including the Federal Government, and any segregation in the Armed Forces\". When [0] encountered opposition from the services, [0] used government control of military spending to force desegregating through, stating \"Wherever Federal Funds are expended\u00a0..., [0] do not see how any American can justify\u00a0... a discrimination in the expenditure of Federal Funds.When Robert B. Anderson, Eisenhower's first Secretary of the Navy, argued that the Navy must recognize the \"customs and usages prevailing in certain geographic areas of our country which the Navy had no part in creating,\" [0] overruled Robert B. Anderson, Eisenhower's first Secretary of the Navy,: \"We have not taken and We shall not take a single backward step. There must be no second class citizens in our country.\"The administration declared racial discrimination a national security issue, as Communists around the world used the racial discrimination and history of violence in our country as a point of propaganda attack.[0] told Washington, D.C. officials to make Washington, D.C. a model for the rest of our country in integrating black and white public-school children. [0] proposed to Congress the Civil Rights Act of 1957 and of 1960 and signed the Civil Rights Act of 1957 and of 1960 into law. The 1957 act for the first time established a permanent civil rights office inside the Justice Department and a Civil Rights Commission to hear testimony about abuses of voting rights. Although the Civil Rights Act of 1957 and of 1960 were much weaker than subsequent civil rights legislation, the Civil Rights Act of 1957 and of 1960 constituted the first significant civil rights acts since 1875.In 1957 the state of Arkansas refused to honor a federal court order to integrate their public school system stemming from the Brown decision. [0] demanded that Arkansas governor Orval Faubus obey a federal court order to integrate their public school system stemming from the Brown decision. When Arkansas governor Orval Faubus balked, [0] placed the Arkansas National Guard under federal control and sent in the 101st Airborne Division. the 101st Airborne Division escorted and protected nine black students' entry to Little Rock Central High School, an all-white public school, marking the first time since the Reconstruction Era our country had used federal troops in the South to enforce the U. S. Constitution. Martin Luther King Jr. wrote to [0] to thank [0] for [0]'s actions, writing \"The overwhelming majority of southerners, Negro and white, stand firmly behind [0]'s resolute action to restore law and order in Little Rock\".[0]'s administration contributed to the McCarthyist Lavender Scare with [0] issuing Executive Order 10450 in 1953. During [0]'s presidency thousands of lesbian and gay applicants were barred from federal employment and over 5,000 federal employees were fired under suspicions of being homosexual. From 1947 to 1961 the number of firings based on sexual orientation were far greater than those for membership in the Communist Party, and government officials intentionally campaigned to make \"homosexual\" synonymous with \"Communist traitor\" such that LGBT people were treated as a national security threat stemming from the belief LGBT people were susceptible to blackmail and exploitation.", "Relations with Congress": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] had a Republican Congress for only [0]'s first two years in office; in the Senate, Republicans held the majority by a one-vote margin. Despite being [0]'s political opponent for the 1952 Republican presidential nomination, Senator Majority Leader Robert A. Taft assisted [0] a great deal by promoting [0]'s proposals among the \"Old Guard\" Republican Senators. Senator Majority Leader Robert A. Taft's death in July 1953 - six months into [0]'s presidency - affected [0] both personally and professionally. [0] noted [0] had lost \"a dear friend\" with Senator Majority Leader Robert A. Taft's passing. [0] disliked Senator Majority Leader Robert A. Taft's successor as Majority Leader, Senator William Knowland, and the relationship between the two men led to tension between the Senate and the White House.tension between the Senate and the White House prevented [0] from openly condemning Joseph McCarthy's's highly criticized methods against communism. To facilitate relations with Congress, [0] decided to ignore Joseph McCarthy's's controversies and thereby deprive Congress of more energy from the involvement of the White House. This position drew criticism from a number of corners. In late 1953, Joseph McCarthy's declared on national television that the employment of communists within the government was a menace and would be a pivotal issue in the 1954 Senate elections. [0] was urged to respond directly and specify the various measures [0] had taken to purge the government of communists.Among [0]'s objectives in not directly confronting Joseph McCarthy's was to prevent Joseph McCarthy's from dragging the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) into Joseph McCarthy's's witch hunt for communists, which might interfere with the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC)'s work on hydrogen bombs and other weapons programs. In December 1953, [0] learned that one of America's nuclear scientists, J. Robert Oppenheimer, had been accused of being a spy for the Soviet Union.  Although [0] never really believed that accused were true, in January 1954 [0] ordered that \"a blank wall\" be placed between one of America's nuclear scientists, J. Robert Oppenheimer, and all defense-related activities. The one of America's nuclear scientists, J. Robert Oppenheimer, security hearing was conducted later that year, resulting in one of America's nuclear scientists, J. Robert Oppenheimer, losing one of America's nuclear scientists, J. Robert Oppenheimer,'s security clearance. The matter was controversial at the time and remained so in later years, with one of America's nuclear scientists, J. Robert Oppenheimer, achieving a certain martyrdom. The matter would reflect poorly on [0] as well, but [0] had never examined The matter in any detail and had instead relied excessively upon the advice of [0]'s subordinates, especially that of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) . [0] later suffered a major political defeat when [0]'s nomination of AEC chairman Lewis Strauss to be Secretary of Commerce was defeated in the Senate in 1959, in part due to AEC chairman Lewis Strauss's role in The matterone of America's nuclear scientists, J. Robert Oppenheimer, .In May 1955, Joseph McCarthy's threatened to issue subpoenas to the White House personnel. [0] was furious, and issued an order as follows: \"It is essential to efficient and effective administration that employees of the Executive Branch be in a position to be completely candid in advising with each other on official matters\u00a0... it is not in the public interest that any of employees of the Executive Branch's conversations or communications, or any documents or reproductions, concerning such advice be disclosed.\" This was an unprecedented step by [0] to protect communication beyond the confines of a cabinet meeting, and soon became a tradition known as executive privilege. [0]'s denial of Joseph McCarthy's's access to [0]'s staff reduced Joseph McCarthy's's hearings to rants about trivial matters and contributed to Joseph McCarthy's's ultimate downfall.In early 1954, the Old Guard put forward a constitutional amendment, called the Bricker Amendment, which would curtail international agreements by the Chief Executive, such as the Yalta Agreements. [0] opposed a constitutional amendment, called the Bricker Amendment, which would curtail international agreements by the Chief Executive, such as the Yalta Agreements. the Old Guard agreed with [0] on the development and ownership of nuclear reactors by private enterprises, which the Democrats opposed. [0] succeeded in getting legislation creating a system of licensure for nuclear plants by the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) Democrats gained a majority in both houses in the 1954 Senate elections. [0] had to work with the Democratic Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson (later U.S. president) in the Senate and Speaker Sam Rayburn in the House, both from Texas. Joe Martin, the Republican Speaker from 1947 to 1949 and again from 1953 to 1955, wrote that [0] \"never surrounded [0] with assistants who could solve political problems with professional skill. There were exceptions, Leonard W. Hall, for example, who as chairman of the Republican National Committee tried to open the White House's eyes to the political facts of life, with occasional success. However, these exceptions were not enough to right the balance.\"Speaker Martin concluded that [0] worked too much through subordinates in dealing with Congress, with results, \"often the reverse of what [0] has desired\" because Members of Congress, \"resent having some young fellow who was picked up by the White House without ever having been elected to office himself some young fellow who was picked up by the White House without ever having been elected to office himself coming around and telling Members of Congress '[0] wants this'. the White House never made use of many Republicans of consequence whose services in one form or another would have been available for the asking.\"", "Judicial appointments": "Dwight Eisenhower is our person to focus on. [0] appointed the following Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States:Whittaker was unsuited for the role and soon retired (in 1962, after [0]'s presidency had ended). Stewart and Harlan were conservative Republicans, while Brennan was a Democrat who became a leading voice for liberalism. In selecting a Chief Justice, [0] looked for an experienced jurist who could appeal to liberals in the party as well as law-and-order conservatives, noting privately that Brennan \"represents the kind of political, economic, and social thinking that [0] believe we need on the Supreme Court of the United States\u00a0... Brennan has a national name for integrity, uprightness, and courage that, again, [0] believe we need on the Supreme Court of the United States\".", "States admitted to the Union": "[0] is our person to focus on. Two states were admitted to the Union during [0]'s presidency.", "Health issues": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] began chain smoking cigarettes at West Point, often three or four packs a day. [0] joked that [0] \"gave [[0]] an order\" to stop cold turkey in 1949. However, Evan Thomas says the true story was more complex. At first, [0] removed cigarettes and ashtrays, but removed did not work. [0] told a friend:[0] was the first president to release information about [0]'s health and medical records while in office, but people around [0] deliberately misled the public about [0]'s health. On September 24, 1955, while vacationing in Colorado, [0] had a serious heart attack. While convalescing at Building 500 Howard McCrum Snyder, his personal physician, misdiagnosed the symptoms as indigestion, and failed to call in help that was urgently needed. Howard McCrum Snyder, his personal physician, later falsified Howard McCrum Snyder, his personal physician,'s own records to cover Howard McCrum Snyder, his personal physician,'s blunder and to allow [0] to imply that [0] was healthy enough to do [0]'s job.a serious heart attack required six weeks' hospitalization, during which time Nixon, Dulles, and Sherman Adams assumed administrative duties and provided communication with [0]. [0] was treated by Paul Dudley White, a cardiologist with a national reputation, who regularly informed the press of the president's progress. Instead of discounting [0] as a candidate for a second term as president, Paul Dudley White, a cardiologist with a national reputation, who regularly informed the press of the president's progress recommended a second term as essential to [0]'s recovery.As a consequence of a serious heart attack [0] developed a left ventricular aneurysm, which caused a mild stroke during a cabinet meeting on November 25, 1957, when [0] suddenly found [0] unable to move [0]'s right hand, or to speak as a mild stroke had caused aphasia. [0] also suffered from Crohn's disease, chronic inflammatory condition of the intestine, which necessitated surgery for a bowel obstruction on June 9, 1956. To treat the intestinal block, surgeons bypassed about ten inches of [0]'s small intestine. [0]'s scheduled meeting with Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru was postponed so [0] could recover at [0]'s farm. [0] was still recovering from bypassed during the Suez Crisis. [0]'s health issues forced [0] to give up smoking and make some changes to [0]'s diet, but [0] still drank alcohol. During a visit to England, [0] complained of dizziness and had to have [0]'s blood pressure checked on August 29, 1959; however, before dinner at prime ministerial manor house Chequers on the next day Howard McCrum Snyder, his personal physician, recalled that [0] \"drank several gin-and-tonics, and one or two gins on the rocks\u00a0... three or four wines with the dinner\".[0]'s health during the last three years of [0]'s second term in office was relatively good. Eventually, after leaving the White House, [0] suffered several additional and ultimately crippling heart attacks. A severe heart attack in August 1965 largely ended [0]'s participation in public affairs. On December 12, 1966, [0]'s gallbladder was removed, containing 16 gallstones. After [0]'s death in 1969 (see below), an autopsy revealed an undiagnosed adrenal pheochromocytoma, a benign adrenalin-secreting tumor that may have made [0] more vulnerable to heart disease during [0]'s presidency. [0] suffered seven heart attacks from 1955 until [0]'s death.", "End of presidency": "[0] is our person to focus on. The 22nd Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which set a two-term limit on the presidency, was ratified in 1951. [0] was the first president constitutionally prevented from serving a third term.[0] was also the first outgoing president to come under the protection of the Former Presidents Act; two living former presidents, Herbert Hoover and Harry S. Truman, had left office before the Former Presidents Act was passed. Under the Former Presidents Act, [0] was entitled to a lifetime pension, state-provided staff and a Secret Service security detail.In the 1960 election to choose [0]'s successor, [0] endorsed Nixon over Democrat John F. Kennedy. [0] told friends, \"[0] will do almost anything to avoid turning [0]'s chair and country over to Democrat John F. Kennedy.\" [0] actively campaigned for Nixon in the final days, although [0] may have done Nixon some harm. When asked by reporters at the end of a televised press conference to list one of Nixon's policy ideas he had adopted, [0] joked, \"If you give [0] a week, [0] might think of one of Nixon's policy ideas he had adopted. [0] don't remember.\" Democrat John F. Kennedy's used the quote in one of Kennedy's campaign's campaign commercials. Nixon narrowly lost to Democrat John F. Kennedy. [0], was succeeded by Democrat John F. Kennedy.It was originally intended for [0] to have a more active role in the campaign as [0] wanted to respond to attacks Democrat John F. Kennedy made on [0]'s administration. However, First Lady Mamie Eisenhower expressed concern to Second Lady Pat Nixon about the strain campaigning would put on Nixon's heart, and wanted [0] to withdraw, without letting Nixon know of Second Lady Pat Nixon's intervention. Nixon was informed by White House physician Major General Howard Snyder that White House physician Major General Howard Snyder could not approve a heavy campaign schedule for [0]Democrat John F. Kennedy's . Nixon then convinced [0] not to go ahead with a heavy campaign schedule and limit [0] to the original schedule. Nixon reflected that if [0] had carried out a heavy campaign schedule, [0] might have had a decisive impact on the outcome of the election, especially in states that Democrat John F. Kennedy won with razor-thin margins. First Lady Mamie Eisenhower did not tell Dwight why Nixon changed Nixon's mind on Dwight's campaigning until years later.On January 17, 1961, [0] gave his final televised Address to the Nation from the Oval Office. In his final televised Address, [0] raised the issue of the Cold War and role of the U.S. armed forces. [0] described the Cold War: \"We face a hostile ideology global in scope, atheistic in character, ruthless in purpose and insidious in method\u00a0...\" and warned about what [0] saw as unjustified government spending proposals. [0] continued with a warning that \"we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military\u2013industrial complex.\" [0] elaborated, \"we recognize the imperative need for this development\u00a0... the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist\u00a0... Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together.\"Because of legal issues related to holding a military rank while in a civilian office, [0] had resigned his permanent commission as General of the Army before entering the presidency. Upon completion of [0]'s presidential term, his permanent commission as General of the Army was reactivated by Congress and [0] again was commissioned a five-star general in the Army."}, "Post-presidency (1961\u20131969)": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. Following the presidency, [0] moved to the place where he and Mamie had spent much of he and Mamie's post-war time, a working farm adjacent to the battlefield at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, 70 miles (110\u00a0km) from [0]'s ancestral home in Elizabethville, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania. he and Mamie also maintained a retirement home in Palm Desert, California.After leaving office, [0] did not completely retreat from political life. [0] flew to San Antonio, where [0] had been stationed years earlier, to support John W. Goode, the unsuccessful Republican candidate against the Democrat Henry B. Gonzalez for Texas's 20th congressional district seat. [0] addressed the 1964 Republican National Convention, in San Francisco, and appeared with party nominee Barry Goldwater in a campaign commercial from [0]'s Gettysburg, Pennsylvania retreat. That endorsement came somewhat reluctantly, because party nominee Barry Goldwater had in the late 1950s criticized [0]'s administration as \"a dime-store New Deal\". On January 20, 1969, the day Nixon was inaugurated as President, [0] issued a statement praising [0]'s and calling January 20, 1969, the day Nixon was inaugurated as President a \"day for rejoicing\".", "Death": "[0] is our person to focus on. On the morning of March 28, 1969, [0] died in Washington, D.C., of congestive heart failure at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, at age 78. The following day, his body was moved to the Washington National Cathedral's's Bethlehem Chapel, where [0] lay in repose for 28 hours. [0] was then transported to the United States Capitol, where he lay in state in the Capitol Rotunda on March 30 and 31the United States Capitol, where he lay in state in the Capitol Rotunda on March 30 and 31 . A state funeral service was conducted at the Washington National Cathedral's on March 31. The president and First Lady, Richard and Pat Nixon, attended, as did former president Lyndon Johnson.
