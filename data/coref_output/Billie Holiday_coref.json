Some historians have disputed [0]'s paternity, as a copy of [0]'s birth certificate in the Baltimore, Maryland, archives lists [0]'s father as \"Frank DeViese\". Other historians consider lists an anomaly, probably inserted by a hospital or government worker. \"Frank DeViese\" lived in Philadelphia, and Sarah Julia \"Sadie\" Fagan may have known \"Frank DeViese\" through Sarah Julia \"Sadie\" Fagan's work.

[0]'s improvisation of melody to fit the emotion was highly skillful. They's first collaboration included \"What a Little Moonlight Can Do\" and \"Miss Brown to You\". \"What a Little Moonlight Can Do\" has been deemed [0] \"claim to fame\". Brunswick did not favor the recording session because producers wanted [0] to sound more like Cleo Brown. However, after \"What a Little Moonlight Can Do\" was successful, Brunswick began considering [0] an artist in [0]'s own right. [0] began recording under [0]'s own name a year later for Vocalion in sessions produced by John Hammond and Bernie Hanighen. John Hammond said the pianist Teddy Wilson-[0] records from 1935 to 1938 were a great asset to Brunswick. According to John Hammond, Brunswick was broke and unable to record many jazz tunes. pianist Teddy Wilson, [0], Young, and other musicians came into the studio without written arrangements, reducing the recording cost. Brunswick paid [0] a flat fee rather than royalties, which saved Brunswick money. \"Miss Brown to You\" sold 15,000 copies, which John Hammond called \"a giant hit for Brunswick.... Most records that made money sold around three to four thousand.\"Another frequent accompanist was tenor saxophonist Lester Young, who had been a boarder at her mother's house in 1934 and with whom Holiday had a rapport. tenor saxophonist Lester Young, who had been a boarder at her mother's house in 1934 and with whom Holiday had a rapport said, \"tenor saxophonist Lester Young, who had been a boarder at her mother's house in 1934 and with whom Holiday had a rapport think you can hear that on some of the old records, you know.

In late 1937, [0] had a brief stint as a big-band vocalist with Count Basie. The traveling conditions of the band were often poor; the band performed many one-nighters in clubs, moving from city to city with little stability. [0] chose the songs she sang and had a hand in the arrangements, choosing to portray [0]'s developing persona of a woman unlucky in love. [0]'s tunes included \"I Must Have That Man\", \"Travelin' All Alone\", \"I Can't Get Started\", and \"Summertime\", a hit for [0] in 1936, originating in George Gershwin's Porgy and Bess the year before. Count Basie became used to [0]'s heavy involvement in the band. Count Basie said, \"When [0] rehearsed with the band, it was really just a matter of getting her tunes like [0] wanted her tunes, because [0] knew how [0] wanted to sound and you couldn't tell [0] what to do.\" Some of the songs she sang were recorded. \"I Can't Get Started\", \"They Can't Take That Away from Me\", and \"Swing It Brother Swing\" are all commercially available.

Various reasons have been given for why [0] was fired. Jimmy Rushing, Count Basie's male vocalist, called [0]'s unprofessional. According to All Music Guide, [0] was fired for being \"temperamental and unreliable\". [0] complained of low pay and poor working conditions and may have refused to sing the songs requested of [0] or change [0]'s style. [0] was hired by Artie Shaw a month after being fired from the bandCount Basie . This association placed [0] among the first black women to work with a white orchestra, an unusual arrangement at that time. This association was also the first time a black female singer employed full-time toured the segregated U.S. South with a white bandleader. In situations where there was a lot of racial tension, Artie Shaw was known to stick up for Artie Shaw's . In [0]'s autobiography, [0] describes an incident in which [0] was not permitted to sit on the bandstand with other vocalists because [0] was black. Artie Shaw said to [0], \"Artie Shaw want [0] on the band stand like Helen Forrest, Tony Pastor and everyone else.\" When touring the segregated U.S. South, [0] would sometimes be heckled by members of the audience. In Louisville, Kentucky, a man called [0] a \"nigger wench\" and requested [0] sing another song. [0] lost [0]'s temper and had to be escorted off the stage.By March 1938, the Basie and Webb bands had been broadcast on New York City's's powerful radio station WABC (the original WABC, now WCBS). Because of the Basie and Webb bands's success, the Basie and Webb bands were given an extra time slot to broadcast in April, which increased the Basie and Webb bands's exposure. The New York Amsterdam News reviewed broadcast and reported an improvement in [0]'s performance. Metronome magazine reported that the addition of [0] to Artie Shaw's put the band in the \"top brackets\". [0] could not sing as often during Artie Shaw's shows as [0] could in Count Basie's; the repertoire was more instrumental, with fewer vocals. Artie Shaw was also pressured to hire a white singer, Nita Bradley, with whom [0] did not get along but had to share a bandstand. In May 1938, Artie Shaw won band battles against Tommy Dorsey and Red Norvo, with the audience favoring [0]. Although Artie Shaw admired [0]'s singing in Artie Shaw's , saying [0] had a \"remarkable ear\" and a \"remarkable sense of time\", [0]'s tenure with the band was nearing an end. In November 1938, [0] was asked to use the service elevator at the Lincoln Hotel in New York City's, instead of the one used by hotel guests, because white patrons of the hotels complained. asked may have been the last straw for [0]. [0] left the band shortly after. [0] spoke about asked weeks later, saying, \"[0] was never allowed to visit the bar or the dining room as did other members of the band ... [and] [0] was made to leave and enter through the kitchen.\" There are no surviving live recordings of [0] with Artie Shaw's . Because [0] was under contract to a different record label and possibly because of [0]'s race, [0] was able to make only one record with Artie Shaw, \"Any Old Time\". However, Artie Shaw played clarinet on four songs [0] recorded in New York City's on July 10, 1936: \"Did I Remember?\", \"No Regrets\", \"Summertime\" and \"Billie's Blues\".By the late 1930s, [0] had toured with Count Basie and Artie Shaw, scored a string of radio and retail hits with Teddy Wilson, and became an established artist in the recording industry. [0]'s songs \"What a Little Moonlight Can Do\" and \"Easy Living\" were imitated by singers across America and were quickly becoming jazz standards. In September 1938, Holiday's single \"I'm Gonna Lock My Heart\" ranked sixth as the most-played song September 1938. Her record label, Vocalion, listed Holiday's single \"I'm Gonna Lock My Heart\" as Her record label, Vocalion,'s fourth-best seller for September 1938, and Holiday's single \"I'm Gonna Lock My Heart\" peaked at number 2 on the pop charts, according to Joel Whitburn's Pop Memories: 1890\u20131954.", "1939: \"Strange Fruit\" and Commodore Records": "[0] is our person to focus on.

[0] later said that the imagery of Strange Fruit, a song by Abel Meeropol based on his poem about lynching reminded [0] of her father's's death and that reminded played a role in [0]'s resistance to performing Strange Fruit, a song by Abel Meeropol based on his poem about lynching.For [0]'s performance of Strange Fruit, a song by Abel Meeropol based on his poem about lynching at Caf\u00e9 Society, an integrated nightclub in Greenwich Village, [0] had waiters silence the crowd when Strange Fruit, a song by Abel Meeropol based on his poem about lynching began.

When [0]'s producers at Columbia found the subject matter too sensitive, Milt Gabler agreed to record Strange Fruit, a song by Abel Meeropol based on his poem about lynching for his Commodore Records label on April 20, 1939.

Not only was there assurance of phrasing and intonation; but there was also an outgoing warmth, a palpable eagerness to reach and touch the audience. And there was mocking wit. A smile was often lightly evident on [0]'s lips and [0]'s eyes as if, for once, [0] could accept the fact that there were people who did dig [0]. The beat flowed in [0]'s uniquely sinuous, supple way of moving the story along; the words became [0]'s own experiences; and coursing through it all it all was Lady's sound \u2013 a texture simultaneously steel-edged and yet soft inside; a voice that was almost unbearably wise in disillusion and yet still childlike, again at the centre. the audience was [0] from before [0] sang, greeting [0] and saying good-bye with heavy, loving applause.
