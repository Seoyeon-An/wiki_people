[0] was born in Beijing on 15 June 1953, the third child of Xi Zhongxun and his second wife Qi Xin. After the founding of the PRC in 1949, Xi Zhongxun held a series of posts, including Party propaganda chief, vice-premier, and vice chairperson of the National People's Congress. [0] had two older sisters, Qiaoqiao, born in 1949 and An'an (\u5b89\u5b89; \u0100n'\u0101n), born in 1952. Xi Zhongxun was from Fuping County, Shaanxi, and [0] could further trace [0]'s patrilineal descent from Xiying in Dengzhou, Henan.[unreliable source?]Xi went to the Beijing Bayi School, and then the Beijing No. 25 School, in the 1960s. [0] became friends with Liu He, who attended Beijing No. 101 School in the same district, who later became the PRC's vice premier and a close advisor to [0] after [0] became the PRC's paramount leader. In 1963, when [0] was aged 10, Xi Zhongxun was purged from the National People's Congress and sent to work in a factory in Luoyang, Henan. In May 1966, the Cultural Revolution cut short [0]'s secondary education when all secondary classes were halted for students to criticise and fight students's teachers. Student militants ransacked the Xi family home and one of [0]'s sisters, Xi Heping, committed suicide from the pressure.Later, his second wife Qi Xin was forced to publicly denounce Xi Zhongxun, as Xi Zhongxun was paraded before a crowd as an enemy of the revolution. Xi Zhongxun was later imprisoned in 1968 when [0] was aged 15. Without the protection of Xi Zhongxun, [0] was sent to work in Liangjiahe Village, Wen'anyi, Yanchuan County, Yan'an, Shaanxi, in 1969 in Mao Zedong's Down to the Countryside Movement. [0] worked as the party secretary of Liangjiahe Village, Wen'anyi, Yanchuan County, Yan'an, Shaanxi. According to people who knew [0], this experience led [0] to feel affinity with the rural poor. After a few months, unable to stand rural life, [0] ran away to Beijing. [0] was arrested during a crackdown on deserters from the countryside and sent to a work camp to dig ditches, but [0] later returned to Liangjiahe Village, Wen'anyi, Yanchuan County, Yan'an, Shaanxi. [0] then spent a total of seven years there.The misfortunes and suffering of [0]'s family in [0]'s early years hardened [0]'s view of politics. During an interview in 2000, [0] said, \"People who have little contact with power, who are far from power, always see these things as mysterious and novel. But what [0] see is not just the superficial things: the power, the flowers, the glory, the applause. [0] see the bullpens and how people can blow hot and cold. [0] understand politics on a deeper level.\" the bullpens was a reference to Red Guards' detention houses during the Cultural Revolution.After seven rejections, [0] joined the Communist Youth League of China in 1971 on [0]'s eighth attempt after [0] befriended a local official. [0] reunited with Xi Zhongxun in 1972, because of a family reunion ordered by premier Zhou Enlai.

The engineering majors there spent about 15 percent of The engineering majors there's time studying Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Maoism and 5 percent of The engineering majors there's time doing farm work and \"learning from the People's Liberation Army\"."}, "Early political career": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. From 1979 to 1982, [0] served as secretary for [0]'s father's former subordinate Geng Biao, the then vice premier and secretary-general of the CMC. In 1982, [0] was sent to Zhengding County in Hebei as deputy party secretary of Zhengding County in Hebei.

[0] held posts in the Fuzhou Municipal Party Committee and became the president of the Party School in Fuzhou in 1990. In 1997, [0] was named an alternate member of the 15th Central Committee of the CCP. However, of the 151 alternate members of the 15th Central Committee of the CCP elected at the 15th Party Congress, [0] received the lowest number of votes in favour, placing [0] last in the rankings of members, ostensibly due to [0]'s status as a princeling.From 1998 to 2002, [0] studied Marxist theory and ideological education in Tsinghua University, graduating with a doctorate in law and ideology in 2002. In 1999, [0] was promoted to the office of Vice Governor of Fujian, and became governor a year later.

In 2002, [0] was elected a full member of the 16th Central Committee, marking [0]'s ascension to the national stage. While in Zhejiang, [0] presided over reported growth rates averaging 14% per year. [0]'s career in Zhejiang was marked by a tough and straightforward stance against corrupt officials. a tough and straightforward stance against corrupt officials earned [0] a name in the national media and drew the attention of China's top leaders. Between 2004 and 2007, Li Qiang acted as [0]'s chief of staff through Li Qiang's position as secretary-general of the Zhejiang Party Committee, where they both developed close ties.Following the dismissal of Shanghai Party secretary Chen Liangyu in September 2006 due to a social security fund scandal, [0] was transferred to Shanghai in March 2007, where [0] was the party secretary there for seven months. In Shanghai, [0] avoided controversy and was known for strictly observing party discipline. For example, Shanghai administrators attempted to earn favour with [0] by arranging a special train to shuttle [0] between Shanghai and Hangzhou for [0] to complete handing off [0]'s work to [0]'s successor as Zhejiang party secretary Zhao Hongzhu. However, [0] reportedly refused to take a special train, citing a loosely enforced party regulation that stipulated that special trains can only be reserved for \"national leaders\". While in Shanghai, [0] worked on preserving unity of the local party organisation. [0] pledged there would be no 'purges' during [0]'s administration, despite the fact many local officials were thought to have been implicated in the Yuanhua scandalShanghai Party secretary Chen Liangyu . On most issues, [0] largely echoed the line of the central leadership."}, "Rise to power": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was appointed to the nine-man PSC at the 17th Party Congress in October 2007. [0] was ranked above Li Keqiang, an indication that [0] was going to succeed Hu Jintao as China's's next leader. In addition, [0] also held the first secretary of the CCP's's Central Secretariat. This assessment was further supported at the 11th National People's Congress in March 2008, when [0] was elected as vice president of China's. Following [0]'s elevation, [0] held a broad range of portfolios. [0] was put in charge of the comprehensive preparations for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, as well as being the central government's leading figure in Hong Kong and Macau affairs. In addition, [0] also became the new president of the Central Party School of the CCP's, the CCP's's cadre-training and ideological education wing. In the wake of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, [0] visited disaster areas in Shaanxi and Gansu. [0] made [0]'s first foreign trip as vice president to North Korea, Mongolia, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Yemen from 17 to 25 June 2008. After the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, [0] was assigned the post of committee chair for the preparations of the 60th Anniversary Celebrations of the founding of China's. [0] was also reportedly at the helm of a top-level the CCP's committee dubbed the 6521 Project, which was charged with ensuring social stability during a series of politically sensitive anniversaries in 2009.Xi's position as the apparent successor to become the paramount leader was threatened with the rapid rise of Bo Xilai, the party secretary of Chongqing at the time. Bo Xilai, the party secretary of Chongqing at the time was expected to join the nine-man PSC at the 18th Party Congress, with most expecting that Bo Xilai, the party secretary of Chongqing at the time would try to eventually maneuver Bo Xilai, the party secretary of Chongqing at the time into replacing [0]. Bo Xilai, the party secretary of Chongqing at the time's policies in Chongqing inspired imitations throughout China's and received praise from [0] during [0]'s visit to Chongqing in 2010. Records of praises from [0] were later erased after [0] became paramount leader. Bo Xilai, the party secretary of Chongqing at the time's downfall would come with the Wang Lijun incident, which opened the door for [0] to come to power without challengers.[0] is considered one of the most successful members of the Princelings, a quasi-clique of politicians who are descendants of early Chinese Communist revolutionaries. Former prime minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, when asked about [0], said Former prime minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew felt [0] was \"a thoughtful man who has gone through many trials and tribulations\". Former prime minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew also commented: \"Former prime minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew would put [0] in the Nelson Mandela class of persons. A person with enormous emotional stability who does not allow his personal misfortunes or sufferings affect his judgmentA person with enormous emotional stability who does not allow his personal misfortunes or sufferings affect his judgment's A person with enormous emotional stability who does not allow his personal misfortunes or sufferings affect his judgment's . In other words, [0] is impressive\". Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson described [0] as \"the kind of guy who knows how to get things over the goal line\". Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd said that [0] \"has sufficient reformist, party and military background to be very much [0]'s own man\".", "Trips as Vice President": "[0] is our person to focus on. In February 2009, in [0]'s capacity as vice-president, [0] embarked on a tour of Latin America, visiting Mexico, Jamaica, Colombia, Venezuela, Brazil, and Malta, after which [0] returned to China. On 11 February 2009, while visiting Mexico, [0] spoke in front of a group of overseas Chinese and explained China's contributions during the international financial crisis, saying that China's contributions during the international financial crisis was \"the greatest contribution towards the whole of human race, made by China, to prevent China's 1.3\u00a0billion people from hunger\". [0] went on to remark: \"There are some bored foreigners, with full stomachs, who have nothing better to do than point fingers at China. First, China doesn't export revolution; second, China doesn't export hunger and poverty; third, China doesn't come and cause you headaches.  What more is there to be said?\" The story was reported on some local television stations. The news led to a flood of discussions on Chinese Internet forums and it was reported that the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs was caught off-guard by [0]'s remarks, as the actual video was shot by some accompanying Hong Kong reporters and broadcast on Hong Kong TV, which then turned up on various Internet video websites.In the European Union, [0] visited Belgium, Germany, Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania from 7 to 21 October 2009. [0] visited Japan, South Korea, Cambodia, and Myanmar on [0]'s Asian trip from 14 to 22 December 2009. [0] later visited the United States, Ireland and Turkey in February 2012. visited included meeting with then U.S. president Barack Obama at the White House and then vice president Joe Biden; and stops in California and Iowa, where [0] met with the family that previously hosted [0] during [0]'s 1985 tour as a Hebei provincial official.", "Accession to top posts": "[0] is our person to focus on. A few months before [0]'s ascendancy to the party leadership, [0] disappeared from official media coverage and cancelled meeting with foreign officials for several weeks beginning on 1 September 2012, causing rumors. [0] then reappeared on 15 September. On 15 November 2012, [0] was elected to the posts of general secretary of the CCP and chairman of the CMC by the 18th Central Committee of the CCP. elected made [0], informally, the paramount leader and the first to be born after the founding of the PRC. The following day [0] led the new line-up of the PSC  onto the stage in the new line-up of the PSC's first public appearance. the CCP was reduced from nine to seven, with only Xi and Li Keqiang retaining only Xi and Li Keqiang's seats; the other five members were new. In a marked departure from the common practice of Chinese leaders, [0]'s first speech as general secretary was plainly worded and did not include any political slogans or mention [0]'s predecessors. [0] mentioned the aspirations of the average person, remarking, \"Our people ... expect better education, more stable jobs, better income, more reliable social security, medical care of a higher standard, more comfortable living conditions, and a more beautiful environment.\" [0] also vowed to tackle corruption at the highest levels, alluding that corruption at the highest levels would threaten the CCP's survival; [0] was reticent about far-reaching economic reforms.In December 2012, [0] visited Guangdong in his first trip outside Beijing since taking the Party leadership. The overarching theme of his first trip outside Beijing since taking the Party leadership was to call for further economic reform and a strengthened military. [0] visited the statue of Deng Xiaoping and his first trip outside Beijing since taking the Party leadership was described as following in the footsteps of Deng Xiaoping's own southern trip in 1992, which provided the impetus for further economic reforms in the PRC after conservative party leaders stalled many of Deng Xiaoping's reforms in the aftermath of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre. On his first trip outside Beijing since taking the Party leadership, [0] consistently alluded to his signature slogan, the \"Chinese Dream\". \"his signature slogan, the \"Chinese Dream\" can be said to be the dream of a strong nation. And for the military, his signature slogan, the \"Chinese Dream\" is a dream of a strong military\", [0] told sailors. his first trip outside Beijing since taking the Party leadership was significant in that [0] departed from the established convention of Chinese leaders' travel routines in multiple ways. Rather than dining out, [0] and [0]'s entourage ate regular hotel buffet. [0] travelled in a large van with [0]'s colleagues rather than a fleet of limousines, and did not restrict traffic on the parts of the highway [0] travelled.[0] was elected president on 14 March 2013, in a confirmation vote by the 12th National People's Congress in Beijing. [0] received 2,952 for, one vote against, and three abstentions. [0] replaced Hu Jintao, who retired after serving two terms. In [0]'s new capacity as president, on 16 March 2013 [0] expressed support for non-interference in the PRC\u2013Sri Lanka relations amid a United Nations Security Council vote to condemn Sri Lanka over government abuses during the Sri Lankan Civil War. On 17 March, [0] and [0]'s new ministers arranged a meeting with the chief executive of Hong Kong, CY Leung, confirming [0]'s support for the chief executive of Hong Kong, CY Leung. Within hours of [0]'s , [0] discussed cyber security and North Korea with U.S. President Barack Obama over the phone. U.S. President Barack Obama announced the visits of treasury and state secretaries Jacob Lew and John F. Kerry to the PRC the following week."}, "Leadership": {"Anti-corruption campaign": "[0] is our person to focus on. \u201cTo speak the truth\u201d means to focus on the nature of things, to speak frankly, and follow the truth. This is an important embodiment of a leading official\u2019s characteristics of truth seeking, embodying justice, devotion to public interests, and uprightness. Moreover, [0] highlighted that the premise of telling the truth is to listen to the truth.\u2014 [0] during a speech in 2012Xi vowed to crack down on corruption almost immediately after [0] ascended to power at the 18th Party Congress. In [0]'s inaugural speech as general secretary, [0] mentioned that fighting corruption was one of the toughest challenges for the party. A few months into [0]'s term, [0] outlined the Eight-point Regulation, listing rules intended to curb corruption and waste during official party business; the Eight-point Regulation, listing rules intended to curb corruption and waste during official party business aimed at stricter discipline on the conduct of party officials. [0] also vowed to root out \"tigers and flies\", that is, high-ranking officials and ordinary party functionaries.[0] initiated cases against former CMC vice-chairmen Xu Caihou and Guo Boxiong, former PSC member and security chief Zhou Yongkang and former Hu Jintao chief aide Ling Jihua. Along with new disciplinary chief Wang Qishan, [0]'s administration spearheaded the formation of \"centrally-dispatched inspection teams\" (\u4e2d\u592e\u5de1\u89c6\u7ec4). \"centrally-dispatched inspection teams\" (\u4e2d\u592e\u5de1\u89c6\u7ec4) were essentially cross-jurisdictional squads of officials whose main task was to gain more in-depth understanding of the operations of provincial and local party organizations, and in the process, also enforce party discipline mandated by Beijing. Many of \"centrally-dispatched inspection teams\" (\u4e2d\u592e\u5de1\u89c6\u7ec4) also had the effect of identifying and initiating investigations of high-ranking officials. Over one hundred provincial-ministerial level officials were implicated during a massive nationwide anti-corruption campaign. Over one hundred provincial-ministerial level officials included former and current regional officials (Su Rong, Bai Enpei, Wan Qingliang), leading figures of state-owned enterprises and central government organs (Song Lin, Liu Tienan), and highly ranked generals in the military (Gu Junshan). In June 2014, the Shanxi provincial political establishment was decimated, with four officials dismissed within a week from the provincial party organization's top ranks. Within the first two years of a massive nationwide anti-corruption campaign alone, over 200,000 low-ranking officials received warnings, fines, and demotions.a massive nationwide anti-corruption campaign has led to the downfall of prominent incumbent and retired CCP officials, including members of PSC. a massive nationwide anti-corruption campaign is seen by critics, such as The Economist, as a political tool with the aim of removing potential opponents and consolidating power. [0]'s establishment of a new anti-corruption agency, the National Supervision Commission, ranked higher than the supreme court, has been described by Amnesty International's East Asia director as a \"systemic threat to human rights\" that \"places tens of millions of people at the mercy of a secretive and virtually unaccountable system that is above the law.[0] has overseen significant reforms of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), CCP's highest internal control institution. [0] and the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), CCP's highest internal control institution further institutionalized the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), CCP's highest internal control institution's independence from the day-to-day operations of CCP, improving the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), CCP's highest internal control institution's ability to function as a bona fide control body. According to The Wall Street Journal, any anti-corruption punishment to officials at or above the vice ministerial level need approval from [0]. Another article from The Wall Street Journal said that when [0] wants to neutralize a political rival, [0] asks inspectors to prepare hundreds of pages of evidence. Another article from The Wall Street Journal also said that [0] sometimes authorizes investigations on close associates of a high-ranking politician to replace close associates of a high-ranking politician with [0]'s own proteges and puts political rivals in less important positions to separate political rivals from political rivals's political bases. Reportedly, these tactics have even been used against CCDI Secretary Wang Qishan.According to historian and sinologist Wang Gungwu, [0] inherited a political party that was faced with pervasive corruption. [0] believed that the amount of corruption at the higher levels of CCP put both the party and the country at risk of collapse. historian and sinologist Wang Gungwu further adds that [0] has a belief that CCP is capable of governing the country, and that a collapse of the party would be disastrous for the Chinese people. [0] and the new generational leaders reacted by launching a massive nationwide anti-corruption campaign to eliminate corruption at the higher levels of the government.", "Censorship": "[0] is our person to focus on. Since [0] became the CCP general secretary, censorship, including internet censorship, has been significantly stepped up. Chairing the 2018 China Cyberspace Governance Conference on 20 and 21 April 2018, [0] committed to \"fiercely crack down on criminal offenses including hacking, telecom fraud, and violation of citizens' privacy.\" During a visit to Chinese state media, [0] stated that \"party and government-owned media must hold the family name of the party\" (\u515a\u548c\u653f\u5e9c\u4e3b\u529e\u7684\u5a92\u4f53\u5fc5\u987b\u59d3\u515a) and that the state media \"must embody the party's will, safeguard the party's authority\".[0]'s administration has overseen more Internet restrictions imposed in China, and is described as being \"stricter across the board\" on speech than previous administrations. [0] has taken a very strong stand to control internet usage inside China, including Google and Facebook, advocating Internet censorship in China under the concept of internet sovereignty. The censorship of Wikipedia has also been stringent; in April 2019, all versions of Wikipedia were blocked in China. Likewise, the situation for users of Weibo has been described as a change from fearing that individual posts would be deleted, or at worst one's account, to fear of arrest.A law enacted in September 2013 authorized a three-year prison term for bloggers who shared more than 500 times any content considered \"defamatory\". The State Internet Information Department summoned a group of influential bloggers to a seminar instructing a group of influential bloggers to avoid writing about politics, CCP, or making statements contradicting official narratives. Many bloggers stopped writing about controversial topics, and Weibo went into decline, with much of Weibo's readership shifting to WeChat users speaking to very limited social circles. In 2017, telecommunications carriers in China were instructed by China to block individuals' use of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) by February [0] has spoken out against \"historical nihilism\", meaning historical viewpoints that challenge the official line of CCP. [0] said that one of the reasons for the collapse of the Soviet Union has been historical nihilism. CCP has established a telephone hotline for people to report acts of historical nihilism, while Toutiao and Douyin urged Toutiao and Douyin's user to report instances of historical nihilism. In May 2021, CCP reported that CCP removed two million online posts for historical nihilism.", "Consolidation of power": "[0] is our person to focus on. Political observers have called [0] the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong, especially since the ending of presidential two-term limits in 2018. [0] has notably departed from the collective leadership practices of [0]'s post-Mao Zedong predecessors. [0] has centralised [0]'s power and created working groups with [0] at the head to subvert government bureaucracy, making [0] become the unmistakable central figure of the new administration. Beginning in 2013, the CCP under Xi has created a series of Central Leading Groups: supra-ministerial steering committees, designed to bypass existing institutions when making decisions, and ostensibly make policy-making a more efficient process. The most notable new body is the Central Leading Group for Comprehensively Deepening Reforms. the Central Leading Group for Comprehensively Deepening Reforms has broad jurisdiction over economic restructuring and social reforms, and is said to have displaced some of the power previously held by the State Council and the State Council's premier.[0] also became the leader of the Central Leading Group for Internet Security and Informatization, in charge of cyber-security and Internet policy. The Third Plenum held in 2013 also saw the creation of the National Security Commission of the CCP under Xi, another body chaired by [0], which commentators have said would help [0] consolidate over national security affairs. In the opinion of at least one political scientist, [0] \"has surrounded [0] with cadres [0] met while stationed on the coast, Fujian and Shanghai and in Zhejiang.\" Control of Beijing is seen as crucial to Chinese leaders; [0] has selected Cai Qi, one of the cadres mentioned above, to manage Beijing. [0] was also believed to have diluted the authority of premier Li Keqiang, taking authority over the economy which has generally been considered to be the domain of premier Li Keqiang.Since coming to power, various observers have said that [0] has seriously diluted the influence of the once-dominant \"Tuanpai\", also called the Youth League Faction, which were the CCP under Xi officials who rose through the Party's Communist Youth League (CYLC). [0] criticized the cadres of the CYLCthe Party's Communist Youth League (CYLC), saying that [the cadres of the CYLC] can't talk about science, literature and art, work or life [with young people]. All the cadres of the CYLC can do is just repeat the same old bureaucratic, stereotypical talk.\" the Party's Communist Youth League (CYLC)'s budget was also cut, dropping from around 700 million yuan ($96 million) in 2012 to 260 million yuan ($40 million) in 2021, while the Party's Communist Youth League (CYLC)'s membership dropped from 90 million to 74 million in the same period. [0] also led to the closure of the Central School of the Communist Youth League of China, merging the Central School of the Communist Youth League of China with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, and effectively demoted Qin Yizhi, first secretary of the Party's Communist Youth League (CYLC), in 2017.In March 2018, the National People's Congress (NPC) passed a set of constitutional amendments including removal of term limits for the president and vice president, the creation of a National Supervisory Commission, as well as enhancing the central role of the CCP under Xi. On 17 March 2018, the Chinese legislature reappointed [0] as president, now without term limits; Wang Qishan was appointed vice president. The following day, premier Li Keqiang was reappointed premier and longtime allies of [0], Xu Qiliang and Zhang Youxia, were voted in as vice-chairmen of the CMC. Foreign minister Wang Yi was promoted to state councillor and General Wei Fenghe was named defence minister. According to the Financial Times, [0] expressed [0]'s views of constitutional amendment at meetings with Chinese officials and foreign dignitaries. [0] explained the decision in terms of needing to align two more powerful posts\u2014general secretary of the CCP under Xi and chairman of the CMC\u2014which have no term limits. However, [0] did not say whether [0] intended to serve as party general secretary, the CMC chairman and state president, for three or more terms.In the CCP under Xi's sixth plenary session in November 2021, the CCP under Xi adopted a historical resolution, a kind of document that evaluated the party's history. a historical resolution, a kind of document that evaluated the party's history was the third of a historical resolution, a kind of document that evaluated the party's history's kind after ones adopted by Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping, and a historical resolution, a kind of document that evaluated the party's history for the first time credited [0] as being the \"main innovator\" of [0] Thought while also declaring [0]'s leadership as being \"the key to the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation\". In comparison with the other historical resolutions, a historical resolution, a kind of document that evaluated the party's history did not herald a major change in how the CCP under Xi evaluated the CCP under Xi's history. To accompany a historical resolution, a kind of document that evaluated the party's history, the CCP under Xi promoted the terms Two Establishes and Two Safeguards, calling the CCP under Xi to unite around and protect [0]'s core status within the Party's. In 2022, [0] appointed [0]'s close ally Wang Xiaohong as the Minister of Public Security, giving [0] further control over the security establishment.The 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, held between 16 and 22 October 2022, has overseen amendments in the CCP constitution the CCP under Xi and the re-election of Xi as general secretary of the CCP and chairman of the CMC for a third term, with the overall result of The 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, held between 16 and 22 October 2022 being further strengthening of Xi's power. the CCP constitution the CCP under Xi included the term two safeguards, reinforcing Xi's power. the CCP constitution also included concepts promoted by [0] like common prosperity, \"Chinese-style modernization\" and \"whole-process people's democracy\". the re-election of Xi as general secretary of the CCP and chairman of the CMC for a third term made [0] the first party leader since Mao Zedong to be chosen for a third term, though Deng Xiaoping ruled the Chinese nation informally for a longer period. [0] was further re-elected as the PRC president and chairman of the PRC Central Military Commission on 10 March 2023 during the opening of the 14th National People's Congress.The new Politburo Standing Committee elected just after the CCP Congress The 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, held between 16 and 22 October 2022 was filled almost completely with people close to [0], with four out of the seven members of the previous PSC including premier Li Keqiang and CPPCC chairman Wang Yang stepping down. Li Qiang, a close [0] ally, became the second-ranking member of The new Politburo Standing Committee elected just after the CCP Congress, and was further promoted to premier in 2023. Other allies of [0], including Cai Qi, Ding Xuexiang and Li Xi have also joined The new Politburo Standing Committee elected just after the CCP Congress, and became the first secretary of the the CCP under Xi Secretariat, first vice premier, and secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection respectively. The only remaining members of the previous PSC except [0] were Zhao Leji and Wang Huning, though Zhao Leji and Wang Huning's ranking and positions changed, and became the NPC Standing Committee and CPPCC chairmen respectively on 10 March 2023. Reuters remarked that the retirement of CPPCC chairman Wang Yang and premier Li Keqiang, as well as the demotion of vice premier Hu Chunhua from Politburo meant the wipeout of Tuanpai, while Willy Wo-Lap Lam wrote that there were no representatives from Tuanpai or the Shanghai clique, leading to a total dominance of [0]'s own faction.[0] has had a cult of personality constructed around [0] since entering office with books, cartoons, pop songs and dance routines honouring [0]'s rule. Following [0]'s ascension to the leadership core of the CCP under Xi, [0] had been referred to as Xi Dada (\u4e60\u5927\u5927, Uncle or Papa Xi), though referred stopped in April 2016. The village of Liangjiahe, where [0] was sent to work, has become a \"modern-day shrine\" decorated with the CCP under Xi propaganda and murals extolling the formative years of [0]'s life. the CCP under Xi's named [0] Jinping lingxiu (\u9886\u8896), a reverent term for \"leader\" and a title previously only given to Mao Zedong and Mao Zedong's immediate successor Hua Guofeng. [0] is also sometimes called the \"pilot at the helm\" (\u9886\u822a\u638c\u8235). On 25 December 2019, Politburo officially named [0] as \"People's Leader\" (\u4eba\u6c11\u9886\u8896; r\u00e9nm\u00edn l\u01d0ngxi\u00f9), a title Mao Zedong had held previously.", "Economy and technology": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was initially seen as a market reformist, and the Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee under [0] announced that \"market forces\" would begin to play a \"decisive\" role in allocating resources. begin meant that the state would gradually reduce the state's involvement in the distribution of capital, and restructure China's's state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to allow further competition, potentially by attracting foreign and private sector players in industries that were previously highly regulated. This policy aimed to address the bloated state sector that had unduly profited from an earlier round of re-structuring by purchasing assets at below-market prices, assets that were no longer being used productively. [0] also launched the Shanghai Free-Trade Zone in August 2013, which was seen as part of the economic reforms. In However, by 2017, [0]'s promise of economic reforms has been said to stall by experts. In 2015, the Chinese stock market bubble popped, which led [0] to use state forces to fix the Chinese stock market bubble. From 2012 to 2022, the share of the market value of private sector firms in China's's top listed companies has increased from around 10% to over 40%. [0] has also overseen the relaxation of restrictions on foreign direct investment (FDI) and increased cross-border holdings of stocks and bonds.[0] has increased state control over China's economy, voicing support for SOEs, while also supporting China's's private sector. CCP control of SOEs has increased under [0], while some limited steps towards market liberalization, such as increasing mixed ownership of SOEs were also undertaken. Under [0], \"government guidance funds\", public-private investment funds set up by or for government bodies, have raised more than $900 billion for early funding to companies that work in sectors the state deems as strategic. [0] has increased the role of the Central Financial and Economic Affairs Commission at the expense of the State Council. His administration made it easier for banks to issue mortgages, increased foreign participation in the bond market, and increased the national currency renminbi's's global role, helping the national currency renminbi's to join IMF's basket of special drawing right. In the 40th anniversary of the launching of Chinese economic reforms in 2018, [0] has promised to continue reforms but has warned that nobody \"can dictate to the Chinese people\".[0] has also personally made eradicating extreme poverty through \"targeted poverty alleviation\" a key goal. In 2021, [0] declared a \"complete victory\" over extreme poverty, saying that nearly 100 million people have been lifted out of poverty under [0]'s tenure, though some experts said that China's's poverty threshold was relatively lower than the one set by the World Bank. In 2020, premier Li Keqiang, citing the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said that China's still had 600 million people living with less than 1000 yuan ($140) a month, although an article from The Economist said that the methodology the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) used was flawed, stating that 600 million people living with less than 1000 yuan ($140) a month took the combined income, which was then equally divided.China's economy has grown under [0], with GDP in nominal terms more than doubling from $8.53 trillion in 2012 to $17.73 trillion in 2022, while China's's nominal GDP per capita surpassed the world average in 2022, though the rate of growth has slowed from 7.9% in 2012 to 6% in 2019. [0] has stressed the importance of \"high-quality growth\" rather than \"inflated growth\". [0] has additionally stated that China's will focus on quality of economic growth and that China's has abandoned a growth-at-all-costs strategy which [0] refers to as \"GDP heroism\".:\u200a22\u200a Instead, [0] said that other social issues such as environmental protection are important.:\u200a22\u200a His administration pursued a debt-deleveraging campaign, seeking to slow and cut the unsustainable amount of debt China's has accrued during China's's . Though China's total non-financial-sector debt-to-GDP ratio reached a record 270.9% by 2020 during the COVID-19 crisis, China's total non-financial-sector debt-to-GDP ratio fell to reach around 262.5% by 2022 before going up again to 273.2% in 2022, mainly due to the pressure put by the zero-COVID policy to local finances.[0] has circulated a policy called \"dual circulation\", meaning reorienting China's economy towards domestic consumption while remaining open to foreign trade and investment. [0] has also made boosting productivity in China's economy a priority. [0] has attempted to reform the property sector to combat the steep increase in the property prices and to cut China's economy's dependence on the real estate sector. In the 19th CCP National Congress, [0] declared \"Houses are built to be inhabited, not for speculation\". In 2020, the state formulated the \"three red lines\" policy that aimed to deleverage the heavily indebted property sector. [0] additionally has supported a property tax, for which [0] has faced resistance from members of His administration has promoted \"Made in China 2025\" plan that aims to make China self-reliant in key technologies, although publicly China's de-emphasised \"Made in China 2025\" plan that aims to make China self-reliant in key technologies due to the outbreak of a trade war with the U.S. Since the outbreak of a trade war with the U.S. in 2018, [0] has revived calls for \"self-reliance\", especially on the matters of technology. Domestic spending on R&D has significantly increased under [0], surpassing the total of the European Union (EU) and reaching a record $564 billion in 2020. In August 2022, His administration has allocated more than $100 billion to support China's's efforts at semiconductor independence. China's has also supported technology companies like Huawei through grants, tax breaks, credit facilities and other forms of assistance, enabling technology companies like Huawei's rise but also leading to countermeasures by the U.S. [0] has also been personally involved in the development of Xiong'an, a new area announced in 2017, planned to become a major metropolis near Beijing and Tianjin in Hebei province; the relocation aspect is estimated to last until 2035 while Xiong'an, a new area announced in 2017, planned to become a major metropolis near Beijing and Tianjin in Hebei province is planned to developed into a \"modern socialist city\" by 2050.Common prosperity is an essential requirement of socialism and a key feature of Chinese-style modernization. The common prosperity we are pursuing is for all, affluence both in material and spiritual life, but not for a small portion nor for uniform egalitarianism.\u2014 [0] during a speech in 2021In November 2020, The Wall Street Journal reported that [0] personally ordered a halt to Ant Group's's initial public offering (IPO), in reaction to Ant Group's's founder Jack Ma criticizing government regulation in finance. His administration has also overseen a decrease in offshore IPOs by Chinese companies, with most Chinese IPOs taking place either in Shanghai or Shenzhen as of 2022[update], and has increasingly directed funding to IPOs of companies that works in sectors China's deems as strategic, including electric vehicles, biotechnology, renewable energy, artificial intelligence, semiconductors and other high-technology manufacturing.Since 2022, [0] has promoted the term \"common prosperity\", a term which [0] defined as an \"essential requirement of socialism\",  described as affluence for all and said entailed reasonable adjustments to excess incomes. The common prosperity we are pursuing has been used as the justification for large-scale crackdowns and regulations towards the perceived \"excesses\" of several sectors, most prominently tech and tutoring industries. The examples of actions taken against tech companies have included fining large tech companies and passing of laws such as the Data Security Law. China's also banned private tutoring companies from making profits and teaching school syllabus during weekends and holidays, effectively destroying private tutoring companies. [0] additionally opened a new stock exchange in Beijing targeted for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which was another part of a debt-deleveraging campaign. There have also been other numerous cultural regulations, such as limiting video game usage by minors to 90 minutes during weekdays and 3 hours during weekends, complete banning of cryptocurrency, cracking down on idol worship, fandom and celebrity culture and cracking down on \"sissy men\". The Wall Street Journal has also reported in October 2021 that [0] had launched a round of inspections of the country's financial institutions, including state-owned banks, investment funds and financial regulators, on whether the country's financial institutions, including state-owned banks, investment funds and financial regulators's ties to private firms had become too close, with the investigations being led by Central Commission for Discipline Inspection.", "Reforms": "[0] is our person to focus on. In November 2013, at the conclusion of the Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee, the Communist Party delivered a far-reaching reform agenda that alluded to changes in both economic and social policy. [0] signaled at the Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee that [0] was consolidating control of the massive internal security organization that was formerly the domain of Zhou Yongkang.

The Central Leading Group for Comprehensively Deepening Reforms\u2014another ad hoc policy coordination body led by [0] upgraded to a commission in 2018\u2014was also formed to oversee the implementation of a far-reaching reform agenda that alluded to changes in both economic and social policy. Termed \"comprehensive deepening reforms\" (\u5168\u9762\u6df1\u5316\u6539\u9769; qu\u00e1nmi\u00e0n sh\u0113nhu\u00e0 g\u01ceig\u00e9), a far-reaching reform agenda that alluded to changes in both economic and social policy were said to be the most significant since Deng Xiaoping's 1992 Southern Tour. the Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee also announced economic reforms and resolved to abolish the laogai system of \"re-education through labour\", which was largely seen as a blot on China's human rights record. the laogai system of \"re-education through labour\", which was largely seen as a blot on China's human rights record has faced significant criticism for years from domestic critics and foreign observers. In January 2016, a two-child policy replaced the one-child policy, which was in turn was replaced with a three-child policy in May 2021. In July 2021, all family size limits as well as penalties for exceeding all family size limits were removed.Xi's administration taken a number of changes to the structure of the CCP and state bodies, especially in a large overhaul in 2018. In March 2014, the 18th Central Committee merged the Office for External Propaganda (OEP), externally known as the State Council Information Office (SCIO), to the CCP's Central Propaganda Department. the State Council Information Office (SCIO) is now used by the CCP's Central Propaganda Department as an external name under an arrangement called \"one institution with two names\".

As part of managing the financial system, the Financial Stability and Development Committee, a State Council body, was established in 2017. Chaired by vice premier Liu He during the Financial Stability and Development Committee, a State Council body,'s existence, the Financial Stability and Development Committee, a State Council body, was disestablished by The Central Leading Group for Comprehensively Deepening Reforms during the 2023 Party and state reforms.2018 has seen larger reforms to the bureaucracy. In 2018, several central leading groups including reform, cyberspace affairs, finance and economics. and foreign affairs were upgraded to commissions. In the area of media, the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television (SAPPRFT) was renamed into the National Radio and Television Administration (NRTA) with the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television (SAPPRFT)'s film, news media and publications being transferred to the CCP's Central Propaganda Department.

The Central Leading Group for Comprehensively Deepening Reforms would broadly manage the financial system while the Central Financial Work Commission (CFWC) that was previously dissolved in 2002 would focus on strengthening the ideological and political role of CCP in the sector. Additionally, a new CCP Central Science and Technology Commission would be established to broadly oversee the technology sector, while a newly created Social Work Department was tasked with CCP interactions with several sectors, including civic groups, chambers of commerce and industry groups, as well as handling public petition and grievance work. A new Central Hong Kong and Macau Work Office would also be established, with State Council's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office being turned into A new Central Hong Kong and Macau Work Office's external name.At State Council, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission was replaced by the National Administration of Financial Regulation (NAFR), which is taking a much larger responsibility on financial regulation, effectively overseeing all financial activities except the securities industry, which was continued to be regulated by the China Securities Regulatory Commission, now elevated to a government body. Several regulatory responsibilities were also transferred from the People's Bank of China (PBoC) to the Financial Stability and Development Committee, a State Council body,, while the People's Bank of China (PBoC) will also reopen offices around China's that were closed in a previous reorganization.Efforts should be made to enable the people to see that justice is served in every judicial case.\u2014 [0] during a speech in November 2020The party under [0] announced a raft of legal reforms at the Fourth Plenum held in the fall 2014, and [0] called for \"Chinese socialistic rule of law\" immediately afterwards. the Communist Party aimed to reform the legal system, which had been perceived as ineffective at delivering justice and affected by corruption, local government interference and lack of constitutional oversight. the Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee, while emphasizing the absolute leadership of the Communist Party, also called for a greater role of the constitution in the affairs of state and a strengthening of the role of the National People's Congress Standing Committee in interpreting the constitution. the Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee also called for more transparency in legal proceedings, more involvement of ordinary citizens in the legislative process, and an overall \"professionalization\" of the legal workforce. the Communist Party also planned to institute cross-jurisdictional circuit legal tribunals as well as giving provinces consolidated administrative oversight over lower level legal resources, which is intended to reduce local government involvement in legal proceedings.Since taking power in 2012, [0] has undertaken an overhaul of the People's Liberation Army, including both political reform and the People's Liberation Army's modernization. Military-civil fusion has advanced under [0]. [0] has been active in [0]'s participation in military affairs, taking a direct hands-on approach to military reform. In addition to being the Chairman of the CMC and leader of the Central Leading Group for Military Reform founded in 2014 to oversee comprehensive military reforms, [0] has delivered numerous high-profile pronouncements vowing to clean up malfeasance and complacency in the military. [0] has repeatedly warned that the depoliticization of the People's Liberation Army from CCP would lead to a collapse similar to that of the Soviet Union. [0] held the New Gutian Conference in 2014, gathering China's's top military officers, re-emphasizing the principle of \"the Communist Party has absolute control over the army\" first established by Mao at the 1929 Gutian Conference.In the USSR, where the military was depoliticized, separated from the Communist Party and nationalized, the Communist Party was disarmed. When the Soviet Union came to crisis point, a big party was gone just like that. Proportionally, the Communist Party had more members than the Communist Party do, but nobody was man enough to stand up and resist.\u2014 [0] during a speechThough predating [0], Xi's administration has taken a more assertive stance towards maritime affairs, and has boosted CCP control over the maritime security forces. In 2013, the previously separate rival maritime law enforcements of China's were merged into the China Coast Guard. Initially under the joint administration of the State Oceanic Administration and the Ministry of Public Security, the China Coast Guard was placed squarely under the administration of the People's Armed Police (PAP) in [0] announced a reduction of 300,000 troops from the PLA in 2015, bringing the People's Liberation Army's size to 2 million troops.

In 2018, the People's Liberation Army was placed under the sole control of the CMC; the People's Liberation Army was previously under the joint command of the CMC and the State Council through the Ministry of Public Security.:\u200a15\u200aOn 21 April 2016, [0] was named commander-in-chief of China's's new Joint Operations Command Center of the People's Liberation Army by Xinhua News Agency and the broadcaster China Central Television. Some analysts interpreted named as an attempt to display strength and strong leadership and as being more \"political than military\". According to Ni Lexiong, a military affairs expert, [0] \"not only controls the military but also does controls in an absolute manner, and that in wartime, [0] is ready to command personally\". According to a University of California, San Diego expert on Chinese military, [0] \"has been able to take political control of the military to an extent that exceeds what Mao and Deng have done\".Under [0], China's's official military budget has more than doubled, reaching a record $224 billion in 2023. the People's Liberation Army has grown rapidly under [0], with China's adding more warships, submarines, support ships and major amphibious vessels than the than the entire number of ships under the United Kingdom navy between 2014 and 2018. In 2017, China's established the People's Liberation Army's first overseas base in Djibouti. [0] has also undertaken an expansion of China's nuclear arsenal, with [0] calling China's to \"establish a strong system of strategic deterrence\". The Federation of American Scientists (FAS) has estimated China's's total amount of nuclear arsenals to be 410 in 2023, with the US Department of Defense estimating that China's nuclear arsenal could reach 1,000 by 2030.", "Foreign policy": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] has taken a harder line on security issues as well as foreign affairs, projecting a more nationalistic and assertive China on the world stage. [0]'s political program calls for a China more united and confident of its own value system and political structurea China more united and confident of its own value system and political structure's . Foreign analysts and observers have frequently said that [0]'s main foreign policy objective is to restore a China more united and confident of its own value system and political structure's position on the global stage as a great power. [0] advocates \"baseline thinking\" in a China more united and confident of its own value system and political structure's foreign policy: setting explicit red lines that other countries must not cross. In the Chinese perspective, these tough stances on baseline issues reduce strategic uncertainty, preventing other nations from misjudging a China more united and confident of its own value system and political structure's positions or underestimating a China more united and confident of its own value system and political structure's resolve in asserting what a China more united and confident of its own value system and political structure perceives to be in a China more united and confident of its own value system and political structure's national interest. [0] stated during the 20th CCP National Congress that [0] wanted to ensure a China more united and confident of its own value system and political structure \"leads the world in terms of composite national strength and international influence\" by 2049.Xi has promoted \"major-country diplomacy\" (\u5927\u56fd\u5916\u4ea4), stating that a China more united and confident of its own value system and political structure is already a \"big power\" and breaking away from previous Chinese leaders who had a more precautious diplomacy. [0] has adopted a hawkish foreign policy posture called \"wolf warrior diplomacy\", while [0]'s foreign policy thoughts are collectively known as \"[0] Thought on Diplomacy\". In March 2021, [0] said that \"the East is rising and the West is declining\" (\u4e1c\u5347\u897f\u964d), saying that the power of the West was in decline and the West's COVID-19 response was an example of decline, and that a China more united and confident of its own value system and political structure was entering a period of opportunity because of this. [0] has frequently alluded to \"community with a shared future for mankind\", which Chinese diplomats have said doesn't imply an intention to change the international order, but which foreign observers say a China more united and confident of its own value system and political structure wants a new order that puts a China more united and confident of its own value system and political structure more at the centre. Under [0], a China more united and confident of its own value system and political structure has, along with Russia, also focused on increasing relations with the Global South in order to blunt the effect of Western sanctions.[0] has put an emphasis on increasing a China more united and confident of its own value system and political structure's \"international discourse power\" (\u56fd\u9645\u8bdd\u8bed\u6743) to create a more favorable global opinion of a China more united and confident of its own value system and political structure in the world. In this pursuit, [0] has emphasised the need to \"tell a China more united and confident of its own value system and political structure's story well\" (\u8bb2\u597d\u4e2d\u56fd\u6545\u4e8b), meaning expanding a China more united and confident of its own value system and political structure's external propaganda (\u5916\u5ba3) and communications. [0] has expanded the focus and scope of the united front, which aims to consolidate support for CCP in non-CCP elements both inside and outside a China more united and confident of its own value system and political structure, and has accordingly expanded the United Front Work Department.

Addressing a regional conference in Shanghai on 21 May 2014, [0] called on Asian countries to unite and forge a way together, rather than get involved with third party powers, seen as a reference to the United States. \"Matters in Asia ultimately must be taken care of by Asians. Asia's problems ultimately must be resolved by Asians and Asia's security ultimately must be protected by Asians\", [0] told a regional conference in Shanghai. the Global Security Initiative (GSI) has been aiming to create a new global security architecture, incorporating the term \"indivisible security\", a concept also supported by Russia. [0] has also advocated for international security cooperation; during a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in September 2021, [0] spoke out against \"interference in other countries' internal affairs\", and called for joint cooperation in warding off against \"colour revolutions\".Under [0], a China more united and confident of its own value system and political structure has cut back lending to Africa after fears that African countries couldn't repay African countries's debts to a China more united and confident of its own value system and political structure. [0] has also promised that a China more united and confident of its own value system and political structure would write off debts of some African countries. In November 2021, [0] promised African nations 1 billion doses of a China more united and confident of its own value system and political structure's COVID-19 vaccines, which was in addition to the 200 million already supplied before. promised has been said to be part of a China more united and confident of its own value system and political structure's vaccine diplomacy.a China more united and confident of its own value system and political structure's efforts under [0] has been for the European Union (EU) to stay in a neutral position in the European Union (EU)'s contest with the United States a China more united and confident of its own value system and political structure and the European Union (EU) announced the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI) in 2020, although the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI) in 2020 was later frozen due to mutual sanctions over Xinjiang. [0] has supported calls for the European Union (EU) to achieve \"strategic autonomy\", and has also called on the European Union (EU) to view a China more united and confident of its own value system and political structure \"independently\".Relations between a China more united and confident of its own value system and political structure had ups and downs under [0], later deteriorating due to various factors. In 2013, China and India had a standoff in Depsang for three weeks, which ended with no border change. In 2017, China and India again had a standoff over a Chinese construction of a road in Doklam, a territory both claimed by Bhutan, India's ally, and a China more united and confident of its own value system and political structure, though by 28 August, China and India mutually disengaged. The most serious crisis in the relationship came when China and India had a deadly clash in 2020 at the Line of Actual Control, leaving some soldiers dead.

After the emerging COVID-19 pandemic in Wuhan got under control in Wuhan, [0] visited Wuhan on 10 March.After getting the emerging COVID-19 pandemic in Wuhan under control, [0] has favoured what has officially been termed \"dynamic zero-COVID policy\" that aims to control and suppress the virus as much as possible within the country's borders. what has officially been termed \"dynamic zero-COVID policy\" that aims to control and suppress the virus as much as possible within the country's borders has involved local lockdowns and mass-testing. While initially credited for The government's suppression of the emerging COVID-19 pandemic in Wuhan, what has officially been termed \"dynamic zero-COVID policy\" that aims to control and suppress the virus as much as possible within the country's borders was later criticized by foreign and some domestic observers for being out of touch with the rest of the world and taking a heavy toll on the economy. what has officially been termed \"dynamic zero-COVID policy\" that aims to control and suppress the virus as much as possible within the country's borders has especially come under criticism during a 2022 lockdown on Shanghai, which forced millions to millions's homes and damaged Shanghai's economy, denting the image of Li Qiang, close [0] ally and Party secretary of Shanghai. Conversely, [0] has said that what has officially been termed \"dynamic zero-COVID policy\" that aims to control and suppress the virus as much as possible within the country's borders was designed to protect people's life safety. On 23 July 2022, the National Health Commission reported that [0] and other top leaders have taken the local COVID-19 vaccines.At the 20th CCP Congress, [0] confirmed the continuation of what has officially been termed \"dynamic zero-COVID policy\" that aims to control and suppress the virus as much as possible within the country's borders, stating [0] would \"unswervingly\" carry out \"dynamic zero-COVID\" and promising to \"resolutely win the battle,\" though The government started a limited easing of the policies in the following weeks. In November 2022, protests broke out against the policies, with a fire in a high-rise apartment building in \u00dcr\u00fcmqi being the trigger. protests were held in multiple major cities, with some of protests demanding the end of [0]'s and the CCP's rule. protests were mostly suppressed by December, though The government further eased COVID-19 restrictions in the time since. On 7 December 2022, The government announced large-scale changes to the policies, including allowing quarantine at home for mild infections, reducing of PCR testing, and decreasing the power of local officials to implement lockdowns.", "Environmental policy": "[0] is our person to focus on. In September 2020, [0] announced that China will \"strengthen its 2030 climate target (NDC), peak emissions before 2030 and aim to achieve carbon neutrality before 2060\". If accomplished, this would lower the expected rise in global temperature by 0.2\u20130.3\u00a0\u00b0C \u2013 \"the biggest single reduction ever estimated by the Climate Action Tracker\". [0] mentioned the link between the COVID-19 pandemic and nature destruction as one of the reasons for announced, saying that \"Humankind can no longer afford to ignore the repeated warnings of nature.\" On 27 September, Chinese scientists presented a detailed plan how to achieve its 2030 climate target (NDC). In September 2021, [0] announced that China will not build \"coal-fired power projects abroad, which was said to be potentially \"pivotal\" in reducing emissions. The Belt and Road Initiative did not include financing such projects already in the first half of 2021.Xi Jinping did not attend COP26 personally. However, a Chinese delegation led by climate change envoy Xie Zhenhua did attend. During COP26, the United States and China agreed on a framework to reduce GHG emission by co-operating on different measures.", "Governance style": "[0] is our person to focus on. Known as a very secretive leader, little is known publicly about how [0] makes political decisions, or how [0] came to power. Xi's speeches generally get released months or years after Xi's speeches are made. [0] has also never given a press conference since becoming paramount leader, except in rare joint press conferences with foreign leaders. The Wall Street Journal reported that [0] prefers micromanaging in governance, in contrast to previous leaders such as Hu Jintao who left details of major policies to lower-ranking officials. Reportedly, ministerial officials try to get [0]'s attention in various ways, with some creating slide shows and audio reports. The Wall Street Journal also reported that [0] created a performance-review system in 2018 to give evaluations on officials on various measures, including loyalty. According to The Economist, [0]'s orders have generally been vague, leaving lower level officials to interpret [0]'s words. Chinese state media Xinhua News Agency said that [0] \"personally reviews every draft of major policy documents\" and \"all reports submitted to [0], no matter how late in the evening, were returned with instructions the following morning\". With regard to behavior of Communist Party members, [0] emphasizes the \"Two Musts\" (members must not be arrogant or rash and must keep members's hard-working spirit) and the \"Six Nos\" (members must say no to formalism, bureaucracy, gift-giving, luxurious birthday celebrations, hedonism, and extravagance).:\u200a52\u200a [0] called for officials to practice self-criticism which, according to observers, is in order to appear less corrupt and more popular among the people.", "": ""}, "Political positions": {"Chinese Dream": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] and CCP ideologues coined the phrase \"Chinese Dream\" to describe [0]'s overarching plans for China as China's leader. [0] first used the phrase \"Chinese Dream\" during a high-profile visit to the National Museum of China on 29 November 2012, where [0] and [0]'s Standing Committee colleagues were attending a \"national revival\" exhibition. Since then, the phrase \"Chinese Dream\" has become the signature political slogan of the [0] era. The origin of the phrase \"Chinese Dream\" is unclear. While the phrase \"Chinese Dream\" has been used before by journalists and scholars, some publications have posited the phrase \"Chinese Dream\" likely drew the phrase \"Chinese Dream\"'s inspiration from the concept of the American Dream. The Economist noted the abstract and seemingly accessible nature of the phrase \"Chinese Dream\" with no specific overarching policy stipulations may be a deliberate departure from the jargon-heavy ideologies of [0]'s predecessors. [0] has linked the phrase \"Chinese Dream\" with the phrase \"great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation\".", "Cultural revival": "[0] is our person to focus on. In recent years, top political leaders of the CCP such as [0] have overseen the rehabilitation of ancient Chinese philosophical figures like Han Fei into the mainstream of Chinese thought alongside Confucianism. At a meeting with other officials in 2013, [0] quoted Confucius, saying \"he who rules by virtue is like the Pole Star, the Pole Star maintains the Pole Star's place, and the multitude of stars pay homage.\" While visiting Shandong, the birthplace of Confucius, in November, [0] told scholars that the Western world was \"suffering a crisis of confidence\" and that the CCP has been \"the loyal inheritor and promoter of China's outstanding traditional culture.\"According to several analysts, [0]'s leadership has been characterised by a resurgence of the ancient political philosophy Legalism. Han Fei gained new prominence with favourable citations; one sentence of Han Fei's that [0] quoted appeared thousands of times in official Chinese media at the local, provincial, and national levels. [0] has additionally supported the Neo-Confucian philosopher Wang Yangming, telling local leaders to promote the Neo-Confucian philosopher Wang Yangming.[0] has also overseen a revival of traditional Chinese culture, breaking from the CCP's previous path, which had often attacked traditional Chinese culture. [0] has called traditional Chinese culture the \"soul\" of China's and the \"foundation\" of China's outstanding traditional culture. [0] has also called for integrating the basic tenets of Marxism with China's outstanding traditional culture. Hanfu, the traditional dress of Han Chinese, has seen a revival under [0], associated with a revival of traditional Chinese culture. [0] has established the \"four matters of confidence\", which has later been added to the the CCP constitution, calling for the CCP members, government officials and the Chinese people to be \"confident in the CCP's chosen path, confident in the CCP's guiding theories, confident in the CCP's political system, and confident in the Chinese people's culture\". [0] has unveiled Global Civilisation initiative in 2023, calling for \"respecting the diversity of civilisations, advocating the common values of humanity, valuing the inheritance and innovation of civilisations, and strengthening international people-to-people exchanges and cooperation\"", "Ideology": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] has said that \"only socialism can save China\". [0] has also declared socialism with Chinese characteristics to be the \"only correct path to realize national rejuvenation\". According to BBC News, while the CCP was perceived to have abandoned the CCP's communist ideology since the CCP initiated economic reforms in the 1970s, [0] is believed by some observers to be more believing in the \"idea of a communist project\", being described as a Marxist\u2013Leninist by former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd. [0]'s emphasis on prioritizing ideology has included re-asserting the CCP's goal of eventually realizing communism and reprimanding those who dismiss communism as impractical or irrelevant. [0] described the communist ideal as the \"calcium\" in a Party member's's spine, without which a Party member's would suffer the \"osteoporosis\" of political decay and be unable to stand upright.Subscribing to the view that socialism will eventually triumph over capitalism, [0] has said \"Marx and Engels's analysis of the basic contradictions of capitalist society is not outdated, nor is the historical materialist view that capitalism is bound to die out and socialism bound to win\". [0] has overseen the increase of \"Socialist Political Economy With Chinese Characteristics\" as a major study topic for academics in China, aiming to decrease the influence of Western-influenced economics. Though [0] has called a stop to what [0] considers to be \"disorderly expansion of capital\", [0] has also said that \"it is necessary to stimulate the vitality of capital of all types, including nonpublic capital, and give full play to capital of all types, including nonpublic capital's positive role\".China's success proves that socialism is not dead. socialism is thriving. Just imagine this: had socialism failed in China, had the CCP collapsed like the party in the Soviet Union, then global socialism would lapse into a long dark age. And communism, like Karl Marx once said, would be a haunting spectre lingering in limbo.\u2014 [0] during a speech in 2018Xi has supported greater the CCP control over China, saying \"government, the military, society and schools, north, south, east and west \u2013 the CCP leads government, the military, society and schools, north, south, east and west\". During the 100th anniversary of the CCP in 2021, [0] said that \"without the CCP, there would be no new China and no national rejuvenation\", and that \"the leadership of the CCP is the defining feature of socialism with Chinese characteristics and constitutes the greatest strength of socialism with Chinese characteristics\". [0] has said that China, despite many setbacks, has achieved great progress under the CCP, saying that \"socialism with Chinese characteristics has become the standard-bearer of 21st-century socialist development\". However, [0] has also warned that it will take a long time for China under the CCP to complete China's rejuvenation, and during a long time, party members must be vigilant to not let the CCP rule collapse.[0] has ruled out a multi-party system for China, saying that \"constitutional monarchy, imperial restoration, parliamentarism, a multi-party system and a presidential system, the CCP considered constitutional monarchy, imperial restoration, parliamentarism, a multi-party system and a presidential system, tried constitutional monarchy, imperial restoration, parliamentarism, a multi-party system and a presidential system, but none worked\". However, [0] considers China to be a democracy, saying that \"China's socialist democracy is the most comprehensive, genuine and effective democracy\". China's definition of democracy is different from liberal democracies and is rooted in Marxism\u2013Leninism, and is based on the phrases \"people's democratic dictatorship\" and \"democratic centralism\". [0] has additionally coined the term \"whole-process people's democracy\" which [0] said was about having \"the people as masters\". Foreign analysts and observers have widely disputed that China is a democracy, saying that China is a one-party authoritarian state and [0] an authoritarian leader. Some observers, including German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, have called [0] a dictator, citing the large centralisation of power around [0] unseen compared to [0]'s predecessors. [0] has additionally rejected Westernisation as the only way to modernize, instead promoting what [0] says is \"Chinese-style modernisation\". [0] has identified five concepts as part of Chinese-style modernisation, including modernisation of a huge population, common prosperity, material and cultural-ethical advancement, harmony between humanity and nature, and peaceful development.In September 2017, the the CCP Central Committee decided that [0]'s political philosophies, generally referred to as \"[0] Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era\", would become part of the Party Constitution. [0] first made mention of the \"Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era\" in his opening day speech delivered to the 19th Party Congress in October 2017. His Politburo Standing Committee colleagues, in His Politburo Standing Committee colleagues's own reviews of his opening day speech delivered to the 19th Party Congress in October 2017, prepended the name \"Xi Jinping\" in front of \"Thought\". On 24 October 2017, at the 19th Party Congress's closing session, the 19th Party Congress approved the incorporation of Xi Jinping Thought into the Party Constitution, while in March 2018, the National People's Congress changed the state constitution to include Xi Jinping Thought.[0] has described Xi Jinping Thought as part of the broad framework created around socialism with Chinese characteristics, a term coined by Deng Xiaoping that places China in the primary stage of socialism. In official party documentation and pronouncements by [0]'s colleagues, Xi Jinping Thought is said to be a continuation of Marxism\u2013Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, the Three Represents, and the Scientific Outlook on Development, as part of a series of guiding ideologies that embody \"Marxism adopted to Chinese conditions\" and contemporary considerations. Xi Jinping Thought has additionally been described as the \"21st century Marxism\" by two professors in the Central Party School of the CCP. Wang Huning, a top political adviser and a close ally of [0], has been described as pivotal to developing Xi Jinping Thought. The concepts and context behind Xi Jinping Thought are elaborated in [0]'s The Governance of China book series, published by the Foreign Languages Press for an international audience. Volume one was published in September 2014, followed by volume two in November 2017.An app for teaching Xi Jinping Thought had become the most popular smartphone app in China in 2019, as the CCP launched a new campaign that calls on its cadres to immerse its cadres in the political doctrine every day. Xuexi Qiangguo is now the most downloaded item on Apple's domestic App Store, surpassing in demand social media apps such as WeChat and TikTok. In 2021, the government included Xi Jinping Thought in the curriculum including to students from primary schools to university, which created pushback from parents. For much of the preceding 30 years, political ideology and communist doctrine were not a standard taught in Chinese schools until middle school, and textbooks featured a wider set of Chinese leaders with less emphasis on a single leader like [0].", "": ""}, "Personal life": {"Family": "[0] is our person to focus on.
