In November 2014, [0] announced that [0] would be forming a further incarnation of the name of Band Aid, to be known as Band Aid 30, to record an updated version of \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\", with the proceeds going to treat victims of the Ebola virus in West Africa.", "Live Aid": "[0] is our person to focus on. \"The greatest legacy of Live Aid for me personally, is the example of how [0]'s leadership demonstrated the power of the individual. How the voice and action of just one person could start a movement that could make a difference.\"\u2014Live Aid production manager Andy Zweck.As [0] began to learn more about the situation, [0] discovered that one of the main reasons why African nations were in such dire peril was the obligation to make repayments on loans that African nations's countries had taken from Western banks. For every pound donated in aid, ten times as much would have to leave the country in loan repayments. It became obvious that one song was not enough.On 13 July 1985, [0] and Ure organised Live Aid, a huge event staged simultaneously at the Wembley Stadium in London and John F. Kennedy Stadium in Philadelphia. Thanks to an unprecedented decision by the BBC to clear the BBC's schedules for 16 hours of rock music, Live Aid, a huge event staged simultaneously at the Wembley Stadium in London and John F. Kennedy Stadium in Philadelphia was also broadcast live in the UK on television and radio.Live Aid, a huge event staged simultaneously at the Wembley Stadium in London and John F. Kennedy Stadium in Philadelphia was one of the most monumental stage shows in history, with Phil Collins flying on Concorde so that Phil Collins could play at the Wembley Stadium in London and John F. Kennedy Stadium in Philadelphia on the same day.During the broadcast of Live Aid, [0] shocked viewers into giving cash by not only twice mouthing profanities but also by slamming [0]'s fist on the table and ordering viewers not to go out to the pub but to stay in and watch the show. Nearly seven hours into Live Aid, a huge event staged simultaneously at the Wembley Stadium in London and John F. Kennedy Stadium in Philadelphia, [0] gave an infamous interview in which he used the word fuck.  The BBC presenter David Hepworth, conducting the interviewan infamous interview in which he used the word fuck, had attempted to provide a list of addresses to which potential donations should be sent; [0] interrupted The BBC presenter David Hepworth, conducting the interview in mid-flow and shouted: \"Fuck a list of addresses to which potential donations should be sent, let's get the [phone] numbers!\"  It has passed into folklore that [0] yelled at the audience, \"Give the audience the audience's fucking money!\" although [0] has stated that yelled was never uttered. Due to [0]'s Irish accent, the profanity was stated to be misheard as \"fock\" and \"focking\" respectively.  After yelled, donations increased to \u00a3300 per second.The harrowing video of dying, skeletal children\u2014introduced by David Bowie following the end of David Bowie's set\u2014that had been made by CBC photo-journalists setting CBC photo-journalists's films to the tune of \"Drive\" by The Cars, contributed to Live Aid, a huge event staged simultaneously at the Wembley Stadium in London and John F. Kennedy Stadium in Philadelphia's success.In total, Live Aid raised over \u00a3150\u00a0million for famine relief. [0] subsequently received an honorary knighthood, at age 34, for [0]'s efforts. His autobiography, written soon after with Paul Vallely, was entitled Is That It?. His autobiography, written soon after with Paul Vallely achieved further fame for being featured on the General Certificate of Secondary Education examination syllabus in a following year.Much of the money raised by Live Aid went to NGOs in Ethiopia, some of which were under the influence or control of the Derg military junta. Some journalists have suggested that the Derg military junta was able to use Live Aid and Oxfam money to fund the Derg military junta's enforced resettlement and \"villagification\" programmes, under which at least 3\u00a0million people are said to have been displaced and between 50,000 and 100,000 killed. However, in November 2010 the BBC formally apologised to [0] for misleading implications in the BBC's stories on the subject of Live Aid, saying the BBC had 'no evidence' that Live Aid money specifically went to buy weapons.", "Commission for Africa": "[0] is our person to focus on. In January 2004, on a visit to friends in Africa, [0] came to believe that more people were at risk of starvation there than had died in the famine of 1984/85 which had prompted Live Aid.  [0] telephoned the British Prime Minister Tony Blair from Addis Ababa.  According to the Live 8 programme notes by [0]'s biographer and friend, Paul Vallely, the British Prime Minister Tony Blair responded: \"Calm down [0]. ... And come and see the British Prime Minister Tony Blair as soon as [0] get back.\"The result was the Commission for Africa.  the British Prime Minister Tony Blair invited Geldof and 16 other Commissioners, the majority from Africa and many of them politicians in power, to undertake a year-long study of Africa's problems.  Geldof and 16 other Commissioners, the majority from Africa and many of them politicians in power came up with two conclusions: that Africa needed to change, to improve Africa's governance and combat corruption, and that the rich world needed to support change in new ways.  change meant doubling aid, delivering debt cancellation, and reforming trade rules.  the Commission for Africa drew up a detailed plan of how that could be done.  the Commission for Africa reported in March 2005.  To force the issue [0] decided to create a new international lobby for Africa with eight simultaneous concerts around the world to put pressure on the G8.  [0] called a new international lobby for Africa Live 8.  a detailed plan of how that could be done later became the blueprint for the the G8 Gleneagles African debt and aid package.", "Africa Progress Panel": "[0] is our person to focus on.

Bob Geldof responded that only the biggest-selling artists would attract the huge audience required to capture the attention of the world in the run-up to the G8 meeting.In the lead-up to the G8 meeting, Bob GeldofTony Blair's's , labelled Kumi Naidoo's criticism of the G8 meeting \"a disgrace\". Some leading African campaigners have asked Bob Geldof to stand down from the global anti-poverty movement, and the New Internationalist (between January and February 2006) said 'It would be long overdue if Bob Geldof did.'There were also accusations that Live 8 gave unqualified support to the personal and political agendas of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, particularly in the lead up to an election.  Though many felt that it was Tony Blair and Gordon Brown who had accepted Bob Geldof's agenda, rather than the other way round, accepted led to accusations that Bob Geldof had compromised Bob Geldof's cause.The promises made for Africa at the G8 meeting, were widely praised: \"the greatest summit for Africa ever\" (Kofi Annan), \"an important, if incomplete, boost to the development prospects of the poorest countries\" economist (Jeffrey Sachs) or \"a major breakthrough on debt\" (Kevin Wakins, former head of research at Oxfam).  But many aid agencies pronounced many aid agencies's disappointment with the outcome, feeling that the strict conditions imposed on African countries for accepting debt relief left African countries little better off than before. the New Internationalist scathingly stated, since becoming prominent in the salvation of Africa, \"Bob Geldof has re-released the entire back catalogue of the Boomtown Rats.\"Oasis guitarist Noel Gallagher became one of the more vocal sceptics about the impact of Live 8, citing \"Oasis guitarist Noel Gallagher's belief that rock stars have less influence over world leaders than popular culture may believe.  \"Oasis guitarist Noel Gallagher's explanation was:Correct \"Oasis guitarist Noel Gallagher if \"Oasis guitarist Noel Gallagher'm wrong, but are they hoping that one of these guys from the G8 is on a quick 15-minute break at Gleneagles and sees Annie Lennox singing \"Sweet Dreams\" and thinks, 'Fuck me, Annie Lennox might have a point there, you know?'
