[0]'s war poetry on the horrors of trenches and gas warfare was much influenced by [0]'s mentor Siegfried Sassoon and stood in contrast to the public perception of war at the time and to the confidently patriotic verse written by earlier war poets such as Rupert Brooke.

[0] was born on 18 March 1893 at Plas Wilmot, a house in Weston Lane, near Oswestry in Shropshire. [0] was the eldest of Thomas and (Harriett) Susan Owen (n\u00e9e Shaw)'s's four children; [0]'s siblings were Mary Millard, (William) Harold, and Colin Shaw Owen. When [0] was born, Thomas and (Harriett) Susan Owen (n\u00e9e Shaw)'s lived in a comfortable house owned by his grandfather, Edward Shaw.After his grandfather, Edward Shaw's death in January 1897, and a comfortable house owned by his grandfather, Edward Shaw's sale in March, the family lodged in the back streets of Birkenhead. There Thomas Owen temporarily worked in Birkenhead employed by a railway company.  Thomas Owen transferred to Shrewsbury in April 1897 where the family lived with Thomas and (Harriett) Susan Owen (n\u00e9e Shaw)'s in Canon Street.Thomas Owen transferred back to Birkenhead in 1898 when Thomas Owen became stationmaster at Woodside station. the family lived with Thomas Owen at three successive homes in the Tranmere district area of Birkenhead. the family then moved back to Shrewsbury in 1907. [0] was educated at the Birkenhead Institute and at Shrewsbury Technical School (later known as the Wakeman School).Owen discovered [0]'s poetic vocation in about 1904 during a holiday spent in Cheshire. [0] was raised as an Anglican of the evangelical type, and in [0]'s youth was a devout believer, in part thanks to [0]'s strong relationship with (Harriett) Susan Owen (n\u00e9e Shaw)'s, which lasted throughout [0]'s life. [0]'s early influences included the Bible and the Romantic poets, particularly Wordsworth and John Keats.[0]'s last two years of formal education saw [0] as a pupil-teacher at the Wyle Cop school in Shrewsbury. In 1911 [0] passed the matriculation exam for the University of London, but not with the first-class honours needed for a scholarship, which in [0]'s family's circumstances was the only way [0] could have afforded to attend.In return for free lodging, and some tuition for the matriculation exam for the University of London (this has been questioned[citation needed]) [0] worked as lay assistant to the Vicar of Dunsden near Reading, living in the vicarage from September 1911 to February 1913. During this time [0] attended classes at University College, Reading (now the University of Reading), in botany and later, at the urging of the head of the English Department, took free lessons in Old English. [0]'s time spent at Dunsden near Reading led [0] to disillusionment with the Church, both in the Church's ceremony and the Church's failure to provide aid for those in need.From 1913 [0] worked as a private tutor teaching English and French at the Berlitz School of Languages in Bordeaux, France, and later with a family. There [0] met the older French poet Laurent Tailhade, with whom [0] later corresponded in French. When war broke out, [0] did not rush to enlist \u2013 and even considered joining the French army \u2013 but eventually returned to England."}, "War service": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. On 21 October 1915, [0] enlisted in the Artists Rifles. For the next seven months, [0] trained at Hare Hall Camp in Essex. On 4 June 1916, [0] was commissioned as a second lieutenant (on probation) in the Manchester Regiment. Initially [0] held his troops in contempt for his troops's loutish behaviour, and in a letter to [0]'s mother described his troops as \"expressionless lumps\". However, [0]'s imaginative existence was to be changed dramatically by a number of traumatic experiences. [0] fell into a shell hole and suffered concussion; [0] was caught in the blast of a trench mortar shell and spent several days unconscious on an embankment lying amongst the remains of one of [0]'s fellow officers. Soon afterward, [0] was diagnosed with neurasthenia or shell shock and sent to Craiglockhart War Hospital in Edinburgh for treatment. It was while recuperating at Craiglockhart War Hospital in Edinburgh that [0] met fellow poet Siegfried Sassoon, met[0]'s .Whilst at Craiglockhart War Hospital in Edinburgh [0] made friends in Edinburgh's artistic and literary circles, and did some teaching at the Tynecastle High School, in a poor area of Edinburgh. In November [0] was discharged from Craiglockhart War Hospital in Edinburgh, judged fit for light regimental duties. [0] spent a contented and fruitful winter in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, and in March 1918 was posted to the Northern Command Depot at Ripon. While in Ripon [0] composed or revised a number of poems, including \"Futility\" and \"Strange Meeting\". [0]'s 25th birthday was spent quietly at Ripon Cathedral, which is dedicated to [0]'s namesake, St. Wilfrid of Hexham.[0] returned in July 1918, to active service in France, although [0] might have stayed on home-duty indefinitely. [0]'s was probably the result of fellow poet Siegfried Sassoon's being sent back to England, after being shot in the head in an apparent \"friendly fire\" incident, and put on sick-leave for the remaining duration of the war. [0] saw it as [0]'s duty to add [0]'s voice to that of fellow poet Siegfried Sassoon, that the horrific realities of the war might continue to be told. fellow poet Siegfried Sassoon was violently opposed to the idea of [0] returning to the trenches, threatening to \"stab [him] in the leg\" if fellow poet Siegfried Sassoon tried returning. Aware of [0]'s attitude, [0] did not inform fellow poet Siegfried Sassoon of [0]'s action until [0] was once again in France.At the very end of August 1918, [0] returned to the front line \u2013 perhaps imitating fellow poet Siegfried Sassoon's example. On 1 October 1918, [0] led units of the Manchester Regiment to storm a number of enemy strong points near the village of Joncourt. For [0]'s courage and leadership in stormthe village of Joncourt , [0] was awarded the Military Cross, an award he had always sought in order to justify himself as a war poet, but the Military Cross, an award he had always sought in order to justify himself as a war poet was not gazetted until 15 February 1919. The citation followed on 30 July 1919:2nd Lt, Wilfred Edward Salter Owen, 5th Bn. Manch. R., T.F., attd. 2nd Bn.For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty in the attack on the Fonsomme Line on October 1st/2nd, 1918. On the company commander becoming a casualty, [0] assumed command and showed fine leadership and resisted a heavy counter-attack. [0] personally manipulated a captured enemy machine gun from an isolated position and inflicted considerable losses on the enemy. Throughout [0] behaved most gallantly. "}, "Death": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was killed in action on 4 November 1918 during the crossing of the Sambre\u2013Oise Canal, exactly one week (almost to the hour) before the signing of the Armistice which ended the war, and was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant the day after [0]'s . His mother received the telegram informing His mother of [0]'s on the Armistice which ended the war, as the church bells in Shrewsbury were ringing out in celebration. [0] is buried at Ors Communal Cemetery, Ors, in northern France. The inscription on [0]'s gravestone, chosen by His mother, is a quotation from [0]'s poetry: \"SHALL LIFE RENEW THESE BODIES? OF A TRUTH ALL DEATH WILL HE ANNUL\" W.O."}, "Poetry": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] is regarded by many as the greatest poet of the First World War, known for [0]'s verse about the horrors of trench and gas warfare. [0] had been writing poetry for some years before the First World War, [0] dating [0]'s poetic beginnings to a stay at Broxton by the Hill when [0] was ten years old.The poetry of William Butler Yeats was a significant influence for [0], but William Butler Yeats did not reciprocate [0]'s admiration, excluding [0] from The Oxford Book of Modern Verse, a decision William Butler Yeats later defended, saying [0] was \"all blood, dirt, and sucked sugar stick\" and \"unworthy of the poet's corner of a country newspaper\". William Butler Yeats elaborated: \"In all the great tragedies, tragedy is a joy to the man who dies ... If war is necessary in our time and place, it is best to forget war's suffering as we do the discomfort of fever ...\"The Romantic poets Keats and Shelley influenced much of [0]'s early writing and poetry. His great friend, the poet Siegfried Sassoon, later had a profound effect on [0]'s poetic voice, and Owen's most famous poems (\"Dulce et Decorum est\" and \"Anthem for Doomed Youth\") show direct results of His great friend, the poet Siegfried Sassoon,'s influence. Manuscript copies of Owen's most famous poems (\"Dulce et Decorum est\" and \"Anthem for Doomed Youth\") survive, annotated in His great friend, the poet Siegfried Sassoon,'s handwriting. Owen's poetry would eventually be more widely acclaimed than that of His great friend, the poet Siegfried Sassoon,. While [0]'s use of pararhyme with heavy reliance on assonance was innovative, [0] was not the only poet at the time to use these particular techniques. [0] was, however, one of the first to experiment with these particular techniques extensively.Anthem for Doomed YouthWhat passing-bells for these who die as cattle?Only the monstrous anger of the guns.Only the stuttering rifles''s rapid rattleCan patter out Only the stuttering rifles''s hasty orisons.No mockeries now for Only the stuttering rifles'; no prayers nor bells,Nor any voice of mourning save the choirs, \u2013The shrill, demented choirs of wailing shells;And bugles calling for Only the stuttering rifles' from sad shires.What candles may be held to speed them all?Not in the hands of boys, but in boys's eyesShall shine the holy glimmers of goodbyes.The pallor of girls''s brows shall be girls''s pall;Their flowers the tenderness of patient minds,And each slow dusk a drawing down of blinds.1920His poetry itself blinds.1920His poetry itself underwent significant changes in 1917. As a part of [0]'s therapy at Craiglockhart, [0]'s doctor, Arthur Brock, encouraged [0] to translate [0]'s experiences, specifically the experiences [0] relived in [0]'s dreams, into poetry. Sassoon, who was becoming influenced by Freudian psychoanalysis, aided [0] here, showing [0] through example what poetry could do. Sassoon, who was becoming influenced by Freudian psychoanalysis,'s use of satire influenced [0][0]'s Sassoon, who was becoming influenced by Freudian psychoanalysis,'s . Further, the content of [0]'s verse was undeniably changed by [0]'s work with His great friend, the poet Siegfried Sassoon,. His great friend, the poet Siegfried Sassoon,'s emphasis on realism and \"writing from experience\" was contrary to [0]'s hitherto romantic-influenced style, as seen in [0]'s earlier sonnets. [0] was to take both His great friend, the poet Siegfried Sassoon,'s gritty realism and [0]'s own romantic notions and create a poetic synthesis that was both potent and sympathetic, as summarised by [0]'s famous phrase \"the pity of war\". In this way, Owen's poetry is quite distinctive, and [0] is, by many, considered a greater poet than His great friend, the poet Siegfried Sassoon,. Nonetheless, His great friend, the poet Siegfried Sassoon, contributed to [0]'s popularity by His great friend, the poet Siegfried Sassoon,'s strong promotion of Owen's poetry, both before and after Owen's death, and His great friend, the poet Siegfried Sassoon,'s editing was instrumental in the making of Owen as a poet.Owen's poems had the benefit of strong patronage, and it was a combination of His great friend, the poet Siegfried Sassoon,'s influence, support from Edith Sitwell, and the preparation of a new and fuller edition of Owen's poems in 1931 by Edmund Blunden that ensured [0]'s popularity, coupled with a revival of interest in Owen's poetry in the 1960s which plucked [0] out of a relatively exclusive readership into the public eye. Though [0] had plans for a volume of verse, for which [0] had written a \"Preface\", [0] never saw [0]'s own work published apart from those poems [0] included in The Hydra, the magazine [0] edited at Craiglockhart War Hospital, and \"Miners\", which was published in The Nation.There were many other influences on [0]'s poetry, including his mother. [0]'s letters to his mother's provide an insight into [0]'s life at the front, and the development of [0]'s philosophy regarding the First World War. Graphic details of the horror [0] witnessed were never spared. [0]'s experiences with religion also heavily influenced [0]'s poetry, notably in poems such as \"Anthem for Doomed Youth\", in which the ceremony of a funeral is re-enacted not in a church, but on the battlefield itself, and \"At a Calvary near the Ancre\", which comments on the Crucifixion of Christ. [0]'s experiences in war led [0] further to challenge [0]'s religious beliefs, claiming in [0]'s poem \"Exposure\" that \"love of God seems dying\".Only five of Owen's poems were published before Owen's death, one in fragmentary form. [0]'s best known poems include \"Anthem for Doomed Youth\", \"Futility\", \"Dulce Et Decorum Est\", \"The Parable of the Old Men and the Young\" and \"Strange Meeting\".However, most of Owen's poems were published posthumously: Poems (1920),The Poems of [0] (1931),The Collected Poems of [0] (1963),The Complete Poems and Fragments (1983); fundamental in this last collection is the poem Soldier's Dream, that deals with [0]'s conception of war.[0]'s full unexpurgated opus is in the academic two-volume work The Complete Poems and Fragments (1994) by Jon Stallworthy. Many of Owen's poems have never been published in popular form.In 1975 Mrs. Harold Owen, Wilfred's sister-in-law, donated all of the manuscripts, photographs and letters which her late husband had owned to the University of Oxford's English Faculty Library. As well as the personal artifacts, all of the manuscripts, photographs and letters which her late husband had owned also includes all of [0]'s personal library and an almost complete set of The Hydra\u00a0\u2013 the magazine of Craiglockhart War Hospital. all of the manuscripts, photographs and letters which her late husband had owned can be accessed by any member of the public on application in advance to the English Faculty librarian.The Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas at Austin holds a large collection of [0]'s family correspondence."}, "Relationship with Sassoon": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] held Siegfried Sassoon in an esteem not far from hero-worship, remarking to [0]'s mother that [0] was \"not worthy to light Siegfried Sassoon's] pipe\". The relationship clearly had a profound impact on Owen, who wrote in his first letter to Sassoon after leaving Craiglockhart \"You have fixed my life \u2013 however short\"Owen, who wrote in his first letter to Sassoon after leaving Craiglockhart \"You have fixed my life \u2013 however short\"'s Owen, who wrote in his first letter to Sassoon after leaving Craiglockhart \"You have fixed my life \u2013 however short\"'s . Siegfried Sassoon wrote that Siegfried Sassoon took \"an instinctive liking to [0]\", and recalled their's time together \"with affection\". On the evening of 3 November 1917 their parted, Owen, who wrote in his first letter to Sassoon after leaving Craiglockhart \"You have fixed my life \u2013 however short\" having been discharged from Craiglockhart. Owen, who wrote in his first letter to Sassoon after leaving Craiglockhart \"You have fixed my life \u2013 however short\" was stationed on home-duty in Scarborough for several months, during which time Owen, who wrote in his first letter to Sassoon after leaving Craiglockhart \"You have fixed my life \u2013 however short\" associated with members of the artistic circle into which Siegfried Sassoon had introduced Owen, who wrote in his first letter to Sassoon after leaving Craiglockhart \"You have fixed my life \u2013 however short\", which included Robbie Ross and Robert Graves. Owen, who wrote in his first letter to Sassoon after leaving Craiglockhart \"You have fixed my life \u2013 however short\" also met H. G.\u00a0Wells and Arnold Bennett, and it was during this period Owen, who wrote in his first letter to Sassoon after leaving Craiglockhart \"You have fixed my life \u2013 however short\" developed the stylistic voice for which Owen, who wrote in his first letter to Sassoon after leaving Craiglockhart \"You have fixed my life \u2013 however short\" is now recognised. Many of Owen, who wrote in his first letter to Sassoon after leaving Craiglockhart \"You have fixed my life \u2013 however short\"'s early poems were penned while stationed at the Clarence Garden Hotel, now the Clifton Hotel in Scarborough's North Bay. A blue tourist plaque on the Clarence Garden Hotel, now the Clifton Hotel in Scarborough's North Bay marks the Clarence Garden Hotel, now the Clifton Hotel in Scarborough's North Bay's association with [0].Siegfried Sassoon [0] kept in touch through correspondence, and after Siegfried Sassoon was shot in the head in July 1918 and sent back to the UK to recover, their met in August and spent what Siegfried Sassoon described as \"the whole of a hot cloudless afternoon together.\" their never saw each other again. About three weeks later, [0] wrote to bid Siegfried Sassoon farewell, as [0] was on the way back to France, and their continued to communicate. After the Armistice, Siegfried Sassoon waited in vain for word from [0], only to be told of [0]'s death several months later. The loss grieved Siegfried Sassoon greatly, and Siegfried Sassoon was never \"able to accept that disappearance philosophically.\" Many years later, Siegfried Sassoon is said, snobbishly, to have told Stephen Spender that Siegfried Sassoon found [0]'s grammar school accent \"embarrassing\". However, in Siegfried Sassoon's own account of Siegfried Sassoon's friendship with [0], which appeared in Siegfried Sassoon's 1945 autobiography, Siegfried's Journey, Siegfried Sassoon conjures up a clear picture of [0]'s personality, and writes with great tenderness of the time their spent together. Calling that disappearance \"a chasm in Siegfried Sassoon's private existence\", Siegfried Sassoon expressed regret at what Siegfried Sassoon regarded as Siegfried Sassoon's \"slowness in discovering that [[0]] was to be of high significance for Siegfried Sassoon, both as a poet and friend...and there was much comfort in [0]'s companionship\"."}, "Sexuality": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. Though it has been suggested that [0] hoped to marry Albertina Dauthieu, at the time living in Milnathort, Scotland, had [0] survived the war, Robert Graves and Sacheverell Sitwell, both of whom knew [0], believed that [0] was homosexual, and that homoeroticism was a central element in much of [0]'s poetry. Through Sassoon, [0] was introduced to a sophisticated homosexual literary circle which included Oscar Wilde's friend Robbie Ross, writer and poet Osbert Sitwell, and Scottish writer C. K. Scott Moncrieff, the translator of Marcel Proust. This contact, it is argued, broadened [0]'s outlook, and increased [0]'s confidence in incorporating homoerotic elements into [0]'s work. Historians have debated whether [0] had an affair with Scottish writer C. K. Scott Moncrieff, the translator of Marcel Proust in May 1918; Scottish writer C. K. Scott Moncrieff, the translator of Marcel Proust had dedicated various works to a \"Mr\u00a0W.O.\", but [0] never responded.Throughout [0]'s lifetime and for decades after, homosexual activity between men was a punishable offence throughout the United Kingdom, and the account of [0]'s sexual development has been somewhat obscured because his brother Harold removed what his brother Harold considered discreditable passages in [0]'s letters and diaries after the death of their mother. Andrew Motion wrote of [0]'s relationship with Sassoon: \"On the one hand, Sassoon's wealth, posh connections and aristocratic manner appealed to the snob in [0]: on the other, Sassoon's homosexuality admitted [0] to a style of living and thinking that [0] found naturally sympathetic.\" Sassoon, by Sassoon's own account, was not actively homosexual at this time, but began Sassoon's first love affair just after the war ended, in November 1918.An important turning point in [0] scholarship occurred in 1987 when the New Statesman published \"The Truth Untold\" by Jonathan Cutbill, the literary executor of Edward Carpenter, which attacked the academic suppression of [0] as a poet of homosexual experience. Amongst the article's contentions was that the poem \"Shadwell Stair\", previously alleged to be mysterious, was a straightforward elegy to homosexual soliciting in an area of the London docks once renowned for ithomosexual soliciting in an area of the London docks once renowned for it. In June 2022 the poem \"Shadwell Stair\", previously alleged to be mysterious, was included in the anthology, \"100 Queer Poems,\" compiled by Andrew McMillan and Mary Jean Chan."}, "Memory": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on.
