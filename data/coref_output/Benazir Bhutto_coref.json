Begum Nusrat Ispahani was born in Isfahan, Persia (now Iran) to a wealthy Persian merchant family of partial Kurdish descent. the politician Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was the son of Shah Nawaz Bhutto, a prominent politician who had served as Prime Minister of the Junagadh State. The Bhuttos were aristocratic, wealthy landlords from Sindh, Pakistan, part of the waderos or landed gentry. The Bhuttos were Shia Muslims.[0], in [0]'s autobiography \"Daughter of the East\", said \"The diaries of one of The Bhuttos's ancestors, giving the family details, were washed away in a great flood in [0]'s great-grandfather's time. But as children, The Bhuttos were told The Bhuttos were either descended from the Rajputs...or from the Arabs who entered India through The Bhuttos's home province of Sindh in AD 712.\"Some say that [0] is descended from the Arains, a Muslim tribe of Punjab, who have a subclan called Bhutta, and they also claim to be descended from the Arabs who entered India in AD 712 while others say that [0] is descended from the Rajputs.The Bhuttos had married in September 1951, and [0] was The Bhuttos's first child. [0] was given the name of an aunt who had died young. The Bhuttos's three younger children were Murtaza (born 1954), Sanam (1957), and Shahnawaz (1958). When Shah Nawaz Bhutto, a prominent politician who had served as Prime Minister of the Junagadh State died in 1957, the politician Zulfikar Ali Bhutto inherited The Bhuttos's land holdings, making the politician Zulfikar Ali Bhutto extremely wealthy.[0]'s first language was English; as a child [0] spoke Urdu less frequently although [0] was fluent, and barely spoke the local Sindhi language. her mother taught [0] some Persian as a child. [0] initially attended the Lady Jennings Nursery School in Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan. [0] was then sent to the Convent of Jesus and Mary in Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan and from there to the Jesus and Mary Convent, a boarding school in Murree. Murree is near the border with India, and during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 [0] and the other pupils underwent air-raid practices. Taking [0]'s exams in December 1968, [0] passed [0]'s O-levels with high grades.Throughout [0]'s youth, [0] idolised Her father, and Her father, in turn, encouraged [0]'s educational development in contravention of traditional approaches to women then pervasive in Pakistan. Relations between The Bhuttos were however strained during [0]'s childhood; the politician Zulfikar Ali Bhutto embarked on extra-marital affairs with other women, and when Her father objected Her father had the politician Zulfikar Ali Bhutto thrown out of The Bhuttos's house. the politician Zulfikar Ali Bhutto moved to Iran, but after the politician Zulfikar Ali Bhutto prevented the politician Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's children from joining the politician Zulfikar Ali Bhutto there, the politician Zulfikar Ali Bhutto returned to Pakistan six months later, settling in Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan. Throughout [0]'s life, [0] never publicly acknowledged this internal family discord.When [0] was five, Her father became the cabinet minister for energy, and when [0] was nine Her father became Pakistan's foreign minister. From an early age, [0] was exposed to foreign diplomats and figures who were visiting her father, among foreign diplomats and figures who were visiting her father Zhou Enlai, Henry Kissinger, and Hubert Humphrey. When [0] was thirteen, Her father resigned from the government and a year later established his own political party, the Pakistan People's Party (PPP). his own political party, the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) used the motto \"Islam is our's faith, democracy is our's policy, socialism is our's economy. All power to the people.\" his own political party, the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) employed a populist strategy to attract votes, promising \"roti, kapra aur makan\" (bread, clothes, and housing) for every Pakistani and insisting that the disputed territory of Kashmir would be transferred from Indian to Pakistani control.

From 1969 to 1973, [0] studied for an undergraduate degree at Radcliffe College, Harvard University. [0] started when [0] was sixteen, which was younger than normal, but Zulfikar had pulled strings to allow [0]'s premature admittance. Zulfikar asked his friend John Kenneth Galbraith, an economics professor at Harvard who had formerly been a U.S. ambassador to India, to be [0]'s local guardian. Through his friend John Kenneth Galbraith, an economics professor at Harvard who had formerly been a U.S. ambassador to India,, [0] met his friend John Kenneth Galbraith, an economics professor at Harvard who had formerly been a U.S. ambassador to India,'s . his son Peter Galbraith, who became a lifelong friend joined [0] at Radcliffe College, Harvard University a year later. [0] found it difficult adjusting to life in the United States. A fellow student said [0] \"cried most of [0]'s first semester\", although [0] later called [0]'s time at Radcliffe College, Harvard University \"four of the happiest years of [0]'s life\". [0] became a campus tour guide with the Crimson Key Society and the social secretary of [0]'s dormitory, Eliot House.  [0] involved [0] in campaigns against American involvement in the Vietnam War, joining a Moratorium Day protest on Boston Common. [0] encountered activists involved in second wave feminism although was sceptical of some of the views expressed within second wave feminism. At Radcliffe College, Harvard University, [0] majored in comparative government and graduated cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts in 1973.In 1971, while [0] was at Radcliffe College, Harvard University, Zulfikar invited [0] to join Zulfikar in New York City, where Zulfikar was involved in a United Nations Security Council meeting on 1971's Indo-Pakistani War. In December 1971, Zulfikar assumed the presidency of Pakistan, the first democratically elected leader after 13 years of military rule. In 1972, [0] accompanied her father to the India-Pakistan Summit in Simla as a replacement for [0]'s mother, who was ill. There, [0] was introduced to the Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. While in Simla, [0] attracted much attention from both local and national Indian press, the first time [0] received such notice. [0] attributed attracted to the fact that\u2014in [0]'s words\u2014[0] \"symbolized a new generation. [0] had never been an Indian. [0] had been born in Pakistan. [0] was free of the complexes and prejudices which had torn Indians and Pakistanis apart in the bloody trauma of partition.\" In 1974, [0] was flown to Lahore to accompany her father at the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation's summit. Here, [0] met a number of the assembled senior Muslim world leaders, who included Libya's Muammar Gaddafi, Egypt's Anwar Sadat, Syria's Hafez al-Assad, Saudi Arabia's Faisal, and Jordan's Hussein.In autumn 1973, [0] relocated to the United States and began studying for a second undergraduate degree, in Philosophy, Politics and Economics, at Lady Margaret Hall, University of Oxford. After three years, [0] received a second-class degree. At her father's insistence, [0] remained in University of Oxford to study for a one-year postgraduate degree, reading international law and diplomacy; at a one-year postgraduate degree, reading international law and diplomacy [0] attended St Catherine's College, Oxford. One of [0]'s fellow students at University of Oxford stated that there, [0] \"epitomized the classic spoilt rich girl from a third world country\". [0] nevertheless made friends, who later described [0] as a humorous and intellectually curious individual. In 1977, [0] was elected President of the Oxford Union debating society, the first Asian woman to hold President of the Oxford Union debating society. After [0]'s three-month term was up, [0] was succeeded by [0]'s close friend, Victoria Schofield. [0] was also active in the local Conservative Association and it is through this connection that [0] is widely believed to have introduced future British Prime Minister, Theresa May, to future British Prime Minister, Theresa May,'s future husband Philip May.Despite the ongoing tensions between Pakistan and India, [0] interacted socially with Indian students, and while at University of Oxford also made proposals of marriage to two fellow Pakistani students, but was rebuffed on both occasions. [0] biographer Brooke Allen thought that [0]'s time at University of Oxford was \"almost certainly the happiest, most carefree time of [0]'s life\".At University of Oxford, [0] led a campaign calling for the university to give her father an honorary degree; [0] gained the support of her father's old tutor, the historian Hugh Trevor Roper. a campaign calling for the university to give her father an honorary degree was opposed by counter-protests, who believed that her father's supposed involvement in the persecution of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and atrocities during the Bangladesh Liberation War made her father unsuitable. Ultimately, University of Oxford declined to award an honorary degree. In later years, [0] acknowledged that at this time [0] had been ignorant of the Pakistani Army's complicity in atrocities during the Bangladesh Liberation War, although always maintained that her father was blameless on the issue. After [0]'s Oxford education, [0] returned to Pakistan in June 1977, where [0] was scheduled to work at the Prime Minister's office and the \"Inter-Provincial Council of Common Interests\" during the rest of the summer. Intent on a career in the Pakistani Foreign Service, [0] was scheduled to take the Pakistani Foreign Service's entrance exams later in 1977.", "": ""}, "Zia's Pakistan": {"Zulfikar's death and Benazir's arrest: 1977\u20131984": "Benazir Bhutto is our person to focus on. [0] had picked up the political banners of [0]'s husbands, brothers, and fathers before Benazir Bhutto. The legacies of political families passing down through the women had become a South Asian tradition: Indira Gandhi in India; Sirimavo Bandaranaike in Sri Lanka; Fatima Jinnah and my own mother in Pakistan. Benazir Bhutto just never thought it would happen to Benazir Bhutto.\u2014 Benazir Bhutto on the impact of her father.In July 1977, Zulfikar Bhutto\u2014who had just been re-elected in a general election\u2014was overthrown in a military coup (\"Operation Fair Play\") led by Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, the Chief of Army Staff. Both Zulfikar Bhutto\u2014who had just been re-elected in a general election and Benazir Bhutto believed that a military coup (\"Operation Fair Play\") led by Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, the Chief of Army Staff had been assisted by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA); Zulfikar Bhutto\u2014who had just been re-elected in a general election claimed that in a 1975 meeting, U.S. diplomat Henry Kissinger had told Zulfikar Bhutto\u2014who had just been re-elected in a general election that the U.S. would make \"a horrible example\" of Zulfikar Bhutto\u2014who had just been re-elected in a general election if Zulfikar Bhutto\u2014who had just been re-elected in a general election did not terminate Pakistan's efforts to build a nuclear bomb. Now in control of Pakistan, Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, the Chief of Army Staff suspended the constitution, and initiated a regime that combined military rule with social programs designed to further the Islamisation of Pakistani society according to Islamic fundamentalist principles. Socialists, intellectuals, and journalists were arrested. Zulfikar Bhutto\u2014who had just been re-elected in a general election, too, was arrested, initially for less than a month. After a crowd of over one million people greeted Zulfikar Bhutto\u2014who had just been re-elected in a general election's release in Karachi and demonstrations were held in support of Zulfikar Bhutto\u2014who had just been re-elected in a general election, Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, the Chief of Army Staff decided to eliminate Zulfikar Bhutto\u2014who had just been re-elected in a general election permanently.In September, Zulfikar Bhutto\u2014who had just been re-elected in a general election was re-arrested and charged with the 1974 murder of Muhammad Ahmed Khan Kasuri, the father of Ahmed Raza Kasuri, a vocal critic of Zulfikar Bhutto\u2014who had just been re-elected in a general election's . After a military coup (\"Operation Fair Play\") led by Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, the Chief of Army Staff, Bhutto's brothers were sent abroad to canvass international support for Bhutto's brothers's . Bhutto and her mother remained in Pakistan, although Bhutto and her mother were repeatedly detained for short periods. When Benazir Bhutto was able, Benazir Bhutto visited her father in prison. Bhutto and her mother put out a book about Bhutto and her mother's and encouraged PPP supporters to demonstrate in support of her father. Benazir Bhutto also assisted in the preparation of her father's defence case, which was put before first the Lahore High Court, which sentenced her father to death, and then the Supreme Court, which upheld sentenced. Former U.S. attorney general Ramsey Clark attended the trial, relating that the trial was a kangaroo court and that Zulfikar Bhutto\u2014who had just been re-elected in a general election did not receive a fair trial. Just before Zulfikar Bhutto\u2014who had just been re-elected in a general election's , Zulfikar Bhutto\u2014who had just been re-elected in a general election urged Zulfikar Bhutto\u2014who had just been re-elected in a general election's to leave Pakistan, but his wife and daughter refused. Zulfikar Bhutto\u2014who had just been re-elected in a general election was his execution by hanging in April 1979. Bhutto and her mother were then imprisoned for six months, before being released and placed under house arrest for a further six months. Bhutto and her mother were only fully released in April 1980.After a military coup (\"Operation Fair Play\") led by Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, the Chief of Army Staff, Zulfikar Bhutto\u2014who had just been re-elected in a general election had appointed Zulfikar Bhutto\u2014who had just been re-elected in a general election's co-chair of PPP, while in October 1977 Benazir Bhutto was appointed to PPP's central committee. After Zulfikar Bhutto\u2014who had just been re-elected in a general election's death, Benazir Bhutto replaced Zulfikar Bhutto\u2014who had just been re-elected in a general election's role in PPP, becoming PPP's co-leader. In February 1981, Benazir Bhutto formally established the Movement for the Restoration of Democracy (MRD), a group that brought together PPP with other political parties in Pakistan: the Pakistan Muslim League, Pakistan Democratic Party, Mazdoor Kisan Party, National Awami Party, Quomi Mahaz-e-Azadi, Jamiat-i-Ulema-i-Islam, and the Tahrik-i-Istiqlal. The MRD called for a four-point program: an end to martial law, the restoration of the constitution, parliamentary elections, and the transfer of political power from the military to the elected representatives.[citation needed] There was nevertheless much mutual suspicion among the parties in The MRD, with Benazir Bhutto having reluctantly allowed groups that firmly opposed Zulfikar's government to join.From abroad, Benazir Bhutto's brothers, Murtaza and Shahnawaz, turned to paramilitary action, founding the Al Zulfikar group which trained its members to carry out acts of assassination and sabotage to oust Zia's military governmentthe Al Zulfikar group which trained its members to carry out acts of assassination and sabotage to oust Zia's military government's . After Al Zulfikar orchestrated the 1981 Pakistan International Airlines hijacking, Zia's military government used the 1981 Pakistan International Airlines hijacking as the pretext for re-arresting Bhutto and her mother in March. Benazir Bhutto disapproved of the 1981 Pakistan International Airlines hijacking, believing that the 1981 Pakistan International Airlines hijacking strengthened Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, the Chief of Army Staff's hand; that Benazir Bhutto was punished for the 1981 Pakistan International Airlines hijacking may have exacerbated tensions with Bhutto's brothers. In July 1981, Nusrat was released so that Nusrat could seek medical treatment for cancer abroad, but Benazir Bhutto was not. Benazir Bhutto was kept for a time in Karachi before being moved to Sukkur prison and then back again to Karachi. During much of this period, Benazir Bhutto was held in solitary confinement, and experienced a range of health problems, including hair loss, gynaecological issues, and anorexia. In December, Benazir Bhutto was moved into house arrest, where Benazir Bhutto would remain for two years. In the United States\u2014a key ally of Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, the Chief of Army Staff's \u2014Peter Galbraith helped rally support for Benazir Bhutto, including from the politicians Claiborne Pell and James Buckley. When Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, the Chief of Army Staff visited Washington D.C. in December 1982, they raised the issue of Benazir Bhutto's imprisonment with Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, the Chief of Army Staff. As international pressure mounted, Pakistan agreed to release Benazir Bhutto, placing Benazir Bhutto on a flight to Geneva in January 1984.", "Release and self-imposed exile: 1984\u20131986": "[0] is our person to focus on. From Geneva, [0] proceeded to the United Kingdom, undergoing surgery on [0]'s mastoid before renting a flat in London's Barbican Estate. There, [0] socialised with friends, going shopping, hosting dinner parties, and visiting the cinema. One friend said that after [0]'s time in prison [0] remained in \"a mildly traumatized state, jumping at sudden noise and worrying about who might be spying on [0]\". In March, [0] visited New York City and Washington D.C., where [0] met with media figures and middle-ranking government officials but was kept at bay by the administration of President Ronald Reagan. Over the coming few years, [0] made several additional visits to the United Kingdom, spoke to the European Parliament in Strasbourg, visited the Soviet Union, and undertook the Umrah pilgrimage to Mecca.While in exile, [0] became a rallying point for the PPP. a flat in London's Barbican Estate became the unofficial headquarters of its members in exile; its members in exile devoted its members in exile to raising international awareness of the political prisoners being held by Zia's regime. Although [0] was the PPP's acting chairperson, many of the PPP's elder members were unhappy with was, believing [0] insufficiently committed to socialism and fearing that the PPP would become nothing more than a Bhutto family fiefdom. Murtaza believed that it was Murtaza, and not [0], who was their father's's designated political heir; as evidence, Murtaza cited that Murtaza had been asked to manage their father's's Larkana constituency in the 1977 general election. [0] biographer Shyam Bhatia thought that asked was probably Zulfikar's's intention, as Zulfikar's would have recognised the significant impediments to a woman being elected leader in a conservative Islamic society like Pakistan. [0] nevertheless maintained that their father's had always wanted [0] to become a politician.In July 1985, Shahnawaz died under unexplained circumstances in the French city of Cannes. [0] varyingly claimed that Shahnawaz had been murdered by Shahnawaz's wife, Raehana, or had been killed on the orders of Zia's. Zia's regime allowed [0] to bring her brother's body to Pakistan in August, where her brother's body could be interred in the family cemetery at Larkana. Shortly after the burial, [0] was arrested and detained under house arrest in Karachi until November, at which point [0] was released and returned to Europe. In December 1985, martial law was lifted in Pakistan and [0] decided to return home. [0] arrived at Lahore Airport in April 1986, where [0] was greeted by a large crowd. An estimated two million people came to see [0] speak at Iqbal Park, where [0] rallied against Zia's regime. [0] then visited Sindh, Punjab, and Balochistan, speaking to further crowds, and re-established links with the PPP, taking part in a pro-democracy rally on Independence Day on 14 August. Following a pro-democracy rally on Independence Day on 14 August, [0] was again arrested and detained for several weeks in Landhi Jail.Back in Pakistan, [0] agreed to an arranged marriage; [0]'s mother selected Asif Ali Zardari as a suitable husband. Asif Ali Zardari was from a landowning family, and Asif Ali Zardari's father had obtained additional wealth through the construction and cinema industries. The marriage ceremony took place in the Clifton Palace Gardens at Karachi in December 1987. The marriage ceremony was billed as the \"People's Wedding\", serving as a de facto political rally, with a subsequent party in a Lyari stadium being attended by 200,000 people. There, some fired Kalashnikovs into the air in celebration, accidentally resulting in one death and multiple injuries. [0] would have been aware that being married gave [0] an image of respectability which would improve [0]'s chances of being elected. [0] kept the Bhutto family name rather than taking that of Asif Ali Zardari. After an arranged marriage, [0] soon became pregnant and gave birth to [0]'s first son, Bilawal.", "Electoral campaign: 1988": "Benazir Bhutto is our person to focus on. In May 1988, [0] dissolved the assemblies and called a November election. [0] had not wanted Benazir Bhutto to win, and [0]'s choice of date may have been deliberately chosen to coincide with the date when Benazir Bhutto was projected to give birth, thus hindering Benazir Bhutto's ability to campaign. [0] also sought to hinder Benazir Bhutto's chances by declaring that a November election would be held on a non-party basis, with candidates standing as individuals rather than as representatives of a political party. Benazir Bhutto and the PPP launched a legal challenge against declaring. In August, [0] suddenly died when [0]'s aircraft crashed shortly after take-off from Bahawalpur Airport. A joint U.S.\u2013Pakistani investigation was unable to ascertain the cause of crashed, although sabotage was widely suspected, with the Soviets, Americans, Indians, and Israelis all presented as potential culprits. Benazir Bhutto privately attributed crashed to an act of God. After died, the Supreme Court announced that a November election should take place on a party basis, rather than the non-party basis that [0] had desired.Benazir Bhutto insisted that the PPP campaign separately from the MRD, and dropped the PPP's socialist platform in favour of economic Thatcherism and a commitment to the free market. Amid predictions that the PPP would win, the PPP received 18,000 prospective candidates, many offering the PPP money for 18,000 prospective candidates's selection; this influx of new members and candidates caused upset among many established members, who felt that Benazir Bhutto was deserting many established members. In the build-up to a November election, there was a great sense of hope among liberal sectors of Pakistani society. However, Islamic fundamentalists said it was un-Islamic for the country to have Benazir Bhutto. Islamic fundamentalists's propaganda foregrounded what Islamic fundamentalists presented as Benazir Bhutto's un-Islamic behaviour, including a photo of Benazir Bhutto's dancing in a Parisian nightclub. [0] loyalists and Islamic fundamentalists united to form a new political party, Islami Jamhoori Ittehad (IJI), which was funded by the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) also engaged in vote rigging in an attempt to secure an a new political party, Islami Jamhoori Ittehad (IJI), which was funded by the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) victory.Despite these difficulties, Benazir Bhutto led the PPP to victory in a November election, taking 93 of the 205 contested seats. a new political party, Islami Jamhoori Ittehad (IJI), which was funded by the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) took only 54 seats, although a new political party, Islami Jamhoori Ittehad (IJI), which was funded by the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) secured control of Punjab, the country's largest and most powerful province. secured meant that the PPP had the largest number of seats, although not a clear majority. Both the PPP and IJI courted independent MPs hoping to woo independent MPs to Both the PPP and IJI's side, and unsuccessful attempts were also made by the country's right-wing forces to convince some of the elected the PPP parliamentarians to switch allegiance to a new political party, Islami Jamhoori Ittehad (IJI), which was funded by the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) people of the country had rejected bigotry and prejudice in electing a woman Prime Minister. electing was an enormous honor and an equally enormous responsibility... Benazir Bhutto had not asked for this role; Benazir Bhutto had not asked for this role. But the forces of destiny and the forces of history had thrust Benazir Bhutto forward, and Benazir Bhutto felt privileged and awed.\u2014 Benazir Bhutto on becoming this role in Benazir Bhutto's autobiographyPresident Ghulam Ishaq Khan was constitutionally obliged to invite Benazir Bhutto to form the next government, but was reticent to do so. Under growing pressure\u2014including from the U.S., a key ally\u2014he reluctantly did so two weeks after a November election. To build Benazir Bhutto's government, Benazir Bhutto formed a coalition with the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) party, which had 13 seats in parliament, formedthe PPP. Benazir Bhutto was sworn in as the Prime Minister of the country on 2 December 1988. Benazir Bhutto became the first female Prime Minister in a Muslim-majority country, as well as the country's second nationally elected Prime Minister. At 35 years old, Benazir Bhutto was the youngest elected leader in the Islamic world, the world's youngest Prime Minister, and the youngest female Prime Minister ever elected.  After her election, party workers were encouraged to refer to Benazir Bhutto as Mohtarma (\"respected lady\"). There was hope among many observers that Benazir Bhutto's premiership would mark a new era of multi-party democracy, growing gender equality, and better relations with India. Benazir Bhutto personally stated that her election was \"the tipping point in the debate raging in the Islamic world on the role of women in Islam\".In 1988, Benazir Bhutto published her autobiography, sub-titled Daughter of the East in its British edition and Daughter of Destiny in the United States. her autobiography, sub-titled Daughter of the East in its British edition and Daughter of Destiny in the United States was written with the assistance of an American ghost writer. Benazir Bhutto biographer Brooke Allen stating that her autobiography, sub-titled Daughter of the East in its British edition and Daughter of Destiny in the United States was \"pre-eminently a political performance\" written for a Western audience, with the intent of \"seducing Western opinion and opinion-makers\". As well as whitewashing Benazir Bhutto's father's regime, her autobiography, sub-titled Daughter of the East in its British edition and Daughter of Destiny in the United States contained several factual falsifications; Benazir Bhutto wished to present Benazir Bhutto as a ground-breaker when it came to gender issues, and thus presented her mother Nusrat as being far more conservative than her mother Nusrat really was, for instance falsely claiming that her mother Nusrat had urged Benazir Bhutto to wear the burqa when Benazir Bhutto had reached adolescence.", "": ""}, "First term as Prime Minister (1988\u20131990)": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on.

Various members of the PPP old guard, including Mumtaz Ali Bhutto, left PPP in frustration at the pro-capitalist direction [0] had taken.Following [0]'s election, there remained significant mistrust between [0] and the right-wing military administration; many senior military figures viewed [0], like her father-in-law, as a threat to many senior military figures's dominant role in Pakistan's's political arena. The country's three most powerful figures\u2014the army chief Aslam Beg, the ISI chief Hamid Gul, and President Khan\u2014all had contempt for [0]'s family. This opposition was substantial and contributed to [0]'s inability to pass any major legislation during [0]'s first term in office. However, [0] had some successes with initiatives to encourage the development of civil society; [0] ensured the release of a number of political prisoners detained under the Zia government. and lifted the ban on trade unions and student associations. [0] removed many of the constraints imposed on non-governmental organisations, and introduced measures to lift the media censorship introduced by Zia's military administrations. [0] entrusted Shamsul Hasan with dismantling the National Press Trust, a conglomerate of over 15 newspapers, but President Khan delayed signing the documents and thus the National Press Trust, a conglomerate of over 15 newspapers would only be broken up during [0]'s second premiership. A number of social reforms were carried out, such as the establishment of new literacy centres, new pension rights, and the abolition of admission and bed fees forced upon during the Zia government.Among the problems facing Pakistan's when [0] took the Premiership was soaring employment and high unemployment. Pakistan's was bankrupt, with Zia having borrowed at high-interest rates to pay government wages. Many of the policy promises she had made in her election campaign were not delivered because Pakistan's was unable to finance the policy promises she had made in her election campaign; [0] had claimed that a million new homes would be built each year and that universal free education and healthcare would be introduced, none of which was economically feasible for Pakistan's to deliver. Pakistan's also faced a growing problem with the illegal narcotics trade, with Pakistan's being among the world's largest heroin exporters and the drug's use rapidly increasing domestically. [0] pledged that [0] would take tough action on the powerful drug barons.[0] often argued with The country's three most powerful figures\u2014the army chief Aslam Beg, the ISI chief Hamid Gul, and President Khan over [0]'s desired policies, and\u2014according to Allen\u2014\"won some battles but ultimately lost the war\" against The country's three most powerful figures\u2014the army chief Aslam Beg, the ISI chief Hamid Gul, and President Khan. [0] succeeded in getting President Khan's approval to change two of Pakistan's's four provincial governors; [0] appointed General Tikka Khan, one of the few senior military officers who were loyal to [0], as the Governor of Punjab. [0] sought to replace the chair of the joint chiefs of staff, Iftikhar Ahmed Sirohey, but President Khan refused to permit replace. [0] disliked President Khan's hostile attitude toward [0], but President Khan had the backing of the military. In the presidential election, [0] initially proposed Malik Qasim, who had been involved in the MRD, as PPP's nominee, but the military refused to accept proposed. [0] relented and agreed that President Khan could be nominated as PPP's presidential candidate. [0] also wanted to replace Mahbub ul Haq as a finance minister, but again the military opposed [0]. Compromising, [0] accepted Mahbub ul Haq's continued role as finance minister but appointed Wasim Jafri as [0]'s financial advisor. the army chief Aslam Beg made it clear to [0] that the military would not tolerate [0]'s interference in the military's control of the defence and foreign affairs.At the time, 60% of Pakistan's's population lived in PunjabZia's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Nawaz Sharif, as provincial Chief Minister. Both Zia's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Nawaz Sharif, as provincial Chief Minister and [0] attempted to remove the other from power, with [0] accusing Zia's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Nawaz Sharif, as provincial Chief Minister of having rigged the election to become Chief Minister. Zia's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Nawaz Sharif, as provincial Chief Minister benefited from growing Punjabi chauvinism toward Pakistan's's Sindhi minority, as well as a perception that [0]\u2014was attacking Punjab. Although [0] had long supported greater autonomy for Pakistan's provinces, [0] opposed greater autonomy for Pakistan's provinces in the case of Punjab. Zia's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Nawaz Sharif, as provincial Chief Minister's Punjabi authority refused to accept the federal officials whom [0] posted there. Relations between [0] and Pakistan's civil service also deteriorated, causing paralysis of many state affairs; [0] spoke of Pakistan's civil service as \"Zia's bureaucracy\" and [0]'s perceived anti-Punjabi stance impacted many civil servants, of whom 80% were Punjabi.In April 1989, opposition parties organised a parliamentary no-confidence vote in Bhutto's leadership, but a parliamentary no-confidence vote in Bhutto's leadership was defeated by 12 votes. [0] claimed that many National Assembly voters had been bribed to vote against [0], with $10\u00a0million having been supplied for bribed by a Saudi Salafi cleric, Osama bin Laden, who sought to overthrow Pakistan's and replace Pakistan's with an Islamic theocracy. [0]'s conservative critics continued to claim it was un-Islamic for a woman to govern, and unsuccessfully tried to have Pakistan's suspended from the international Organisation of Islamic Cooperation on this basis.", "Foreign and military policy": "[0] is our person to focus on. During [0]'s first premiership, [0] went on a number of foreign trips, enhancing [0]'s image as the first female Prime Minister in the Islamic world. In a number of foreign trips, [0] sought to attract foreign investment and aid for Pakistan. [0] also made efforts to cultivate good relationships with the leaders of Islamic countries who also had good relationships with [0]'s father, including Libya's Gaddafi, Abu Dhabi's Sheikh Zayed, and the Saudi royal family. In 1989, [0] attended the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Kuala Lumpur, where Pakistan was re-admitted to Commonwealth. In January 1989, [0] made a second pilgrimage to Mecca, and in June visited the U.S. to address both houses of Congress and giving the commencement speech at Harvard.As Premier, [0] was reluctant to challenge the ISI's's support for the Islamist mujahideen forces in Afghanistan which were then engaged in a civil war against the country's Marxist\u2013Leninist government. the U.S. was funneling money to the Islamist mujahideen forces in Afghanistan which were then engaged in a civil war against the country's Marxist\u2013Leninist government through Pakistan, although preferred to deal directly with Beg, Gul, and Ishaq Khan rather than through [0]. In April 1989, Gul led an invasion of Afghanistan with the purpose of seizing Jalalabad, which was then to be formed into a capital from which Afghanistan's anti-Soviet, Islamist-dominated opposition forces could operate. When an invasion of Afghanistan failed and the Pakistanis were driven out by the Afghan Army, Gul blamed Bhutto's administration for failed, claiming that someone in [0]'s entourage had leaked details of an invasion of Afghanistan to the Afghan government. Gul was too powerful for [0] to force Gul into retirement, but in May 1989 [0] transferred Gul from the ISI's to another section of the military, placing a more trusted military figure in Gul's role.[0] initially attempted to improve relations with neighbouring India, withdrawing Zia's's offer of a no-war pact and announcing the 1972 Simla Agreement as the basis of future relations. [0] invited Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's wife Sonia as [0]'s guests for a three-day visit in Islamabad following the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation summit. Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi returned on a bilateral visit six months later. [0] pleased Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi by revoking Zia's's offer of the Nishan-e-Pakistan award to the former Indian leader Morarji Desai. The two countries agreed to reduce The two countries's military levels along the border and agreed not to attack The two countries's respective nuclear installations. [0] claimed that [0] terminated support for Sikh separatists active in neighbouring India, something which Zia's had encouraged to destabilise Indian control in their half of the Punjab. This warming of relations angered many domestic Islamist and conservative forces; many domestic Islamist and conservative forces alleged that [0] and Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi were having a sexual relationship, said that [0] was secretly an Indian agent, and also placed renewed emphasis on the fact that [0]'s paternal grandmother had been born to a Hindu family.The people of Kashmir do not fear death because The people of Kashmir are Muslims. The people of Kashmir have the blood of the mujahids and ghazis. The people of Kashmir have the blood of muhajadeens because Kashmiris are the heirs of Prophet Mohammed, Hazrat Ali, and Hazrat Omar.And the brave women of Kashmir? the brave women of Kashmir know how to fight and also to live. And when the brave women of Kashmir live, the brave women of Kashmir do so with dignity. From every village only one voice will emerge: freedom; from every school only one voice will emerge: freedom; every child will shout, \"freedom, freedom, freedom\".\u2014 [0]'s speech rallying Kashmiri militants to fight for independence from neighbouring India, 1990After accusations of being too conciliatory towards neighbouring India, [0] took a harder line against neighbouring India, particularly on the Kashmir conflict. Amid growing Kashmiri protests against Indian rule, in interviews [0] expressed support for the Kashmiri Muslim community. [0] called on the United Nations to oversee the Kashmir plebiscite originally promised in 1948. [0] visited a training camp for pro-independence Kashmiris on the Pakistani side of the border and pledged $5 million for pro-independence Kashmiris's cause; [0] followed this with further statements in support of the pro-independence groups. In one speech, [0] incited Kashmiri Muslims to rise up against pro-independence Kashmiris's . Later, in a 1993 interview, [0] stated that supporting proxy wars in Punjab and Kashmir was the \"one right thing\" undertaken by Zia's, presenting proxy wars in Punjab and Kashmir in part as revenge for neighbouring India's role in \"the humiliating loss of Bangladesh\".In 1990, Major General Pervez Musharraf proposed a military invasion of Kargil as part of an attempt to annex Kashmir; [0] refused to back a military invasion of Kargil, believing that the international condemnation would be severe.With both armies mobilizing on either side of the border, there were growing fears that tensions over Kashmir could result in a nuclear war between Pakistan and neighbouring India. the U.S. sent special envoy Robert Gates to the region to dissuade the Pakistanis from going to war. special envoy Robert Gates could not meet [0]\u2014but met with President Khan, informing President Khan that the U.S. would not support Pakistani military action. special envoy Robert Gates convinced Pakistan to step back from hostilities and to disband the Kashmiri training camps in Pakistan's territory.After [0] became Prime Minister, President Khan and the military were reluctant to tell [0] about Pakistan's nuclear program, and it remains unknown how much [0] knew about Pakistan's nuclear program during [0]'s first term in office. [0] later related that to find out more [0] contacted key scientists in Pakistan's nuclear program, such as A. Q. Khan, [0], bypassing the president and military hierarchy. On [0]'s trip to the U.S., [0] told Congress that \"Pakistan do not possess, nor do Pakistan intend to make, a nuclear device\". While in Washington D.C., [0] met with Zia's director William Webster, who showed [0] a mock-up of the Pakistani nuclear weapon and stated his opinion that research Pakistan's nuclear program Pakistan's nuclear program had reached a crescendo in the final years of Zia's. William's revelations came as a shock to [0]. the U.S. wanted to prevent Pakistan from creating such a device, and President George H. W. Bush informed [0] that U.S. military aid to Pakistan would cease unless Pakistan refrained from producing nuclear bomb cores, the final step in creating the Pakistani nuclear weapon. Between January 1989 and March 1989, [0] authorised cold tests of nuclear weaponry, without fissionable material, although authorised did not satisfy the military authorities. In 1990, shortly before leaving office, the American Ambassador Robert Oakley informed [0] that information obtained by U.S. satellites indicated that [0]'s commitment to not produce weapons-grade uranium had been breached at the Kahuta enrichment plant.", "Dismissal": "Benazir Bhutto is our person to focus on. [0] organised Operation Midnight Jackal, through which [0] used bribery and intimidation to discourage National Assembly members from voting with the PPP.By 1990, the revelation of Operation Midnight Jackal lessened President Khan's's influence in national politics, government and the military.In the 1980s, ethnic violence had broken out in Sindh province, with most of those killed being mohajirs. Late in 1989, the MQM\u2014whose party represented mohajir interests\u2014left Benazir Bhutto's coalition government. the MQM\u2014whose party represented mohajir interests\u2014 then joined other voices in calling for a general strike to protest Bhutto's government. In May 1990, Benazir Bhutto ordered the army to restore peace in Karachi and Hyderabad. Within months of Benazir Bhutto's election, dissolution had set in among Benazir Bhutto's liberal supporters. Benazir Bhutto's narrow majority in National Assembly had left Benazir Bhutto unable to reverse many of the Islamist reforms that Zia had introduced. Benazir Bhutto did not repeal the Hudood Ordinances, which remained in law until 2006. Benazir Bhutto's opposition to legalised abortion frustrated many Pakistani feminists. Throughout her first term, Benazir Bhutto was criticised for being indecisive and unable to maintain control. There had been anger that her husband had been allowed to attend cabinet meetings despite not being a member of Bhutto's government. her husband was also accused of receiving kickbacks and gained the nickname \"Mr Ten Percent\". [0] had extensively spied upon Benazir Bhutto and her husband throughout her first term, President Khan's privately paid plaintiffs to file corruption suits against her husband. While the investigations into her husband's corruption were therefore politically motivated, there also was significant evidence of her husband's guilt in this regard.In 1990, Benazir Bhutto gave birth to Benazir Bhutto's first daughter, Bakhtawar.Tales of corruption in public-sector industries began to surface, which undermined the credibility of Benazir Bhutto. The unemployment and labour strikes began to take place which halted and jammed the economic wheel of the country, and Benazir Bhutto was unable to solve these issues due to the cold war with President Khan's. In August 1990, President Khan's dismissed Bhutto's government under the Eighth Amendment of the constitution. President Khan's claimed that dismissed was necessary owing to Bhutto's government's corruption and inability to maintain law and order. A caretaker government under the control of former PPP member Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi was sworn in, with President Khan's declaring a state of national emergency."}, "First term as leader of the opposition (1990\u20131993)": {"": "Benazir Bhutto is our person to focus on.

According to charges of extortion, her husband had attached a remote-control bomb to the leg of a businessman and forced a businessman to enter a bank and withdraw money. her husband was convicted and remained in prison for three years.In the 1990 general election, the PPP only secured 45 of the 217 seats. The IJI, under the leadership of Nawaz Sharif, won a majority in the Parliament, and Nawaz Sharif became Prime Minister. [0] became the leader of the opposition. From the leader of the opposition [0] attacked Nawaz Sharif's every policy, highlighting his government's's failings in dealing with Pakistan's problems of poverty, unemployment, and lack of healthcare, although not also discussing [0]'s own administration's failures on Pakistan's problems of poverty, unemployment, and lack of healthcare. To journalists [0] remained unrepentant about [0]'s period in office, insisting that [0] had made no mistakes. [0] subsequently also accused Nawaz Sharif of backing the Salafi jihadist militant group al-Qaeda, established by bin Laden. Following the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi in May 1991, [0] visited India to attend Rajiv Gandhi's funeral.As dissatisfaction with his government's grew, the PPP began to restore the support the PPP had lost during [0]'s premiership. Encouraging public protests, in November 1992, [0] organised a 10-mile march from Rawalpindi to Islamabad in protest at his government's. Nawaz Sharif ordered [0] to be placed under house arrest to prevent [0] instigating any uprisings.Despite an economic recovery in late 1993, his government's faced public unease about the direction of Pakistan and industrialisation that revolved around and centered only in Punjab Province. Amid protest and civil disorder in Sindh Province following the imposition of Operation Clean-up, his government's lost control of Sindh Province. The Peoples Party attacked his government's's record on unemployment and industrial racism.Nawaz Sharif had attempted to reduce Khan's powers. Relations between Sharif and President Khan also soured and Nawaz Sharif came under pressure to resign from the armed forces. With growing tensions between Sharif and President Khan, in April 1993 Khan used the Eighth Amendment to dismiss Nawaz Sharif as Prime Minister, citing corruption and misadministration. An agreement was reached whereby Sharif and President Khan would step down. the armed forces formed an interim government and called a general election for October 1993.Their policies were very similar but a clash of personalities occurred, with Sharif and President Khan making many promises but not explaining how Sharif and President Khan were going to pay for many promises. [0] promised price supports for agriculture, pledged a partnership between government and business, and campaigned strongly for the female vote.In February 1993, [0] gave birth to [0]'s daughter, Asifa. 1993, [0] also declared [0] chair of the PPP for life. declared reflected the lack of internal democracy within the PPP.

[0] performed extremely well in Benazir Bhutto's native province, Sindh, and rural Punjab, while Sharif's new party, the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz), was strongest in industrial Punjab and the largest cities such as Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi. Benazir Bhutto was again prime minister, but this time had a weaker parliamentary mandate than Benazir Bhutto had had in 1988. Benazir Bhutto was officially sworn in on 19 October 1993.Realising the threat to Benazir Bhutto's premiership posed by an unsympathetic president, Benazir Bhutto ensured that a [0] member, Farooq Leghari, was nominated and duly elected to the presidency in November. Zardari was freed from prison after Benazir Bhutto returned to office in 1993. During her second term, Benazir Bhutto appointed both her husband and mother to Benazir Bhutto's cabinet. her husband was appointed investment minister, chief of the Intelligence Bureau, director-general of the Federal Investigation Agency, and chair of the new Environment Protection Council. Benazir Bhutto gave her husband a monopoly on the country's's gold imports, a post that earned her husband $10\u00a0million, which her husband deposited in an Indian bank. Allen suggested that measures like these reflected how Benazir Bhutto had \"given up on all Benazir Bhutto's previous ideals and simply caved into the culture of corruption\u2014indeed excelled in the culture of corruption, as Benazir Bhutto had excelled in so many other areas\".John Burns, a journalist from The New York Times, investigated the business transactions of Bhutto and his wife, exposing the scale of both her husband and mother's corruption. By 1996, both her husband and mother's takings through the business transactions of Bhutto and his wife were estimated at $1.5\u00a0billion. A subsequent inquiry by the country's's Accountability Bureau found that in 1996, Bhutto, her husband, and her mother only declared assets totaling $1.2\u00a0million, leaving out the extensive foreign accounts and properties that Bhutto, her husband, and her mother possessed. Despite both her husband and mother's significant earnings, both her husband and mother did not pay the amount of tax owed; between 1993 and 1994, Benazir Bhutto paid no income tax at all. In 1996, Transparency International ranked the country's as the world's second most corrupt country.Benazir Bhutto ordered the construction of a new residence in Islamabad; a new residence in Islamabad covered 110 acres of ground and cost $50\u00a0million to construct.

[0] established family courts with female judges to deal with child custody and family issues, and in 1994\u201395 the first women judges were appointed to the Supreme Courts of Peshawar and Sindh. The fundamentalist Islamic laws introduced to restrict women's rights under Zia nevertheless remained in place; [0]'s failure to remove The fundamentalist Islamic laws introduced to restrict women's rights under Zia brought criticism from liberal circles and damaged [0]'s relations with women's and human rights groups.[0] stated that once back in the office, [0] asked for reasons why the Kahuta enrichment plant had broken [0]'s command by producing weapons-grade uranium and implemented a new system of security at the Kahuta enrichment plant to provide greater oversight of the Kahuta enrichment plant's scientists. Both the military and ISI, however, supported the development of material that could produce viable nuclear weaponry. India had developed the Agni missile a system which would allow India to strike all of Pakistan's major cities, and as a counter, many in the Pakistani administration believed that the Pakistani administration needed an equivalent launch pad system for the Pakistani administration's nuclear warheads. the Pakistani administration decided to make a deal with the North Korean government, exchanging information about enrichment for missile technology. [0] later claimed that on [0]'s 1993 visit to the North Korean government, [0] secretly carried a computer CD containing nuclear data, although [0] subsequently retracted carried.

Bhutto's government was one of only three countries to recognize the Taliban as the legitimate Afghan government, a move that further distanced Bhutto's government from Bhutto's government's Western allies. the Taliban's rise coincided with a broader growth in opposition to [0] from Salafi Islamist groups. Increasingly, there were Salafist protests against [0] in countries other than Pakistan. During a trip to London, [0] faced Islamist protests outside the Dorchester Hotel, where she was staying. Speaking to UK Prime Minister John Major, [0] highlighted Islamist protests outside the Dorchester Hotel, where she was staying as evidence for the growth of Salafi ideology in Britain, commenting that the growth of Salafi ideology in Britain would generate problems for Western countries in future.[0] was prime minister at a time of great racial tension in Pakistan.

To deal with the unrest, [0] permitted [0]'s interior minister, Naseerullah Babar, to launch Operation Blue Fox, a violent crackdown on the MQM. By the time that Operation Blue Fox, a violent crackdown on the MQM was officially completed, The PPP Government announced that 3,000 had been killed in Karachi, although the number may have been far larger. An Amnesty International report commented that while [0] had declared that The PPP Government would end human rights abuses, the use of torture, rape, and extrajudicial killings remained common in Pakistani prisons.Sharif had been a proponent of laissez faire economics and The PPP Government had promoted privatisation. During her second term, [0] also became increasingly open about [0]'s support for such an economic policy, pursuing broadly similar approaches to those of Sharif. her second term therefore witnessed a liberal approach to economics and the privatisation of industrial plants. Pakistan saw a record $20 billion of foreign investment during her second term, largely in the power industry. Pakistan also entered the list of the world's top ten developing capital markets.There were far fewer public hopes regarding her second term than there had been for the first.

The announcement of the 1995 budget was met with strikes and demonstrations.", "Relations with Murtaza": "[0] is our person to focus on. As many PPP members became increasingly dissatisfied with [0] during the 1990s, many PPP members referred to her brother Mir Murtaza, still in exile, as Zulfikar's true heir.

All witnesses were taken into police custody, where two of All witnesses died. It was widely believed in Pakistan that killing had been ordered by a senior government figure; her brother Mir Murtaza, still in exile's supporters thought that [0] and [0]'s husband were responsible.

After her brother Mir Murtaza, still in exile's , [0] re-established a relationship with his mother Nusrat.", "Domestic affairs": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0]'s approval poll rose by 38% after [0] appeared and said in a private television interview after the elections: \"We are unhappy with the manner in which tampered electoral lists were provided in a majority of constituencies; We's voters were turned away.\" The Conservatives attracted voters from religious society (MMA) whose support had collapsed. In confidential official documents [0] had objected to the number of Urdu speaking class in the elections, in the context that [0] had no Urdu-speaking sentiment in [0]'s circle and discrimination was continued even in [0]'s government. [0]'s stance on these issues was perceived as part of rising public disclosure which Altaf Hussain called \"racism\". Due to [0]'s stubbornness and authoritative actions, [0]'s political rivals gave [0] the nickname \"Iron Lady\" of Pakistan. No response was issued by [0], but [0] soon associated with the nickname \"Iron Lady\" of Pakistan.[0] expanded the authoritative rights of Police Combatant Force and the provisional governments that tackled the local opposition aggressively. [0], through [0]'s Internal Security Minister Naseerullah Babar, intensified the internal security operations and steps, gradually putting down the local opposition's political rallies, while [0] did not completely abandon the reconciliation policy. In [0]'s own worlds, [0] announced: \"There was no basis for [strikes] ... in view of the ongoing political process\".", "Economic issues": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was an economist by profession; therefore during [0]'s terms as prime minister, [0] took charge of the Ministry of Finance. [0] sought to improve the country's's declining economy. [0] disagreed with her father's's nationalisation and socialist economics. Soon after the collapse of the Soviet Union, [0] attempted to privatise major industries that had been nationalised in the 1970s. [0] promised to end the nationalisation programme and to carry out the industrialisation programme by means other than state intervention; however, [0] did not carry out the denationalisation program or liberalisation of the economy during her first government. No nationalised units were privatised and few economic regulations were reviewed.the country's suffered a currency crisis when her first government failed to arrest the 30% fall in the value of the Pakistani Rupee from \u20a8. 21 to \u20a8.30 per U.S. dollar. Soon economic progress became [0]'s top priority but [0]'s investment and industrialisation programs faced major setbacks due to conceptions formed by investors based upon [0]'s People's Party nationalisation program in the 1970s. By the 1990s, her father's had also ultimately lost the currency war with the Indian Rupee which beat the value of the Pakistani Rupee for the first time in the 1970s. the nationalisation programme also suffered from many political setbacks, as many of [0]'s government members were either directly or indirectly involved with the government corruption in major government-owned industries, and [0]'s appointed government members allegedly sabotaged [0]'s efforts to privatise major government-owned industries.Overall, the living standard for people in the country's declined as inflation and unemployment grew at an exponential rate particularly as UN sanctions began to take effect. During [0]'s first and second term, the difference between rich and poor visibly increased and the middle class in particular were the ones who bore the brunt of the economic inequality. According to a calculation completed by the Federal Bureau of Statistics, the standard of living for the rich improved while the standard of living for the poor declined. [0] attributed the economic inequality to be a result of ongoing and continuous illegal Bangladeshi immigration. [0] ordered a crackdown on and deportation of illegal Bangladeshi immigrants. Her action strained and created tensions in Bangladesh\u2013the country's relations, as Bangladesh Prime Minister Khaleda Zia refused to accept illegal Bangladeshi immigrants and reportedly sent two planeloads back to the country's. Religious parties also criticised [0] and dubbed Her action as anti-Islamic.Her action backfired and had devastating effects on the country's's . her father's saw Her action as a major economic failure despite her father's's permission granted to [0] for the approval of [0]'s economic policies. her father's blamed [0] for this extensive economic slowdown and Her actionillegal Bangladeshi immigrants. her father's attributed [0]'s government members corruption in government-owned industries as the major sinkhole in the country's's that failed to compete with neighboring India's economy.During [0]'s second term, [0] continued to follow former prime minister Nawaz Sharif's privatisation policies, which [0] called a \"disciplined macroeconomics policy\". After the 1993 general elections, the privatisation programme of state-owned banks and utilities accelerated; more than \u20a8 42\u00a0billion was raised from the sale of nationalised corporations and industries, and another US$20\u00a0billion from the foreign investment made the United States. After 1993, the country's's again entered in the second period of the stagflation and more roughly began bite the country's's financial resources and the financial capital. her first government found it extremely difficult to counter the second period of the stagflation with Pressler amendment and the US financial and military embargo tightened the US financial and military embargo's position. After a year of study, [0] implemented and enforced the Eighth Plan to overcome the stagflation by creating a dependable and effective mechanism for accelerating economic and social progress. But, according to American ambassador to the country's, William Milam's bibliography, Bangladesh and the country's: Flirting with Failure in South Asia, the Eighth Plan to overcome the stagflation was doomed to meet with failure from the very beginning of 1994, as the policies were weak and incoherent.On many occasions, [0] resisted to privatise globally competitive and billion-dollar-worth state-owned enterprises (such as Pakistan Railways and Pakistan Steel Mills), instead the grip of nationalisation in globally competitive and billion-dollar-worth state-owned enterprises (such as Pakistan Railways and Pakistan Steel Mills) was tightened in order to secure the capital investment of globally competitive and billion-dollar-worth state-owned enterprises (such as Pakistan Railways and Pakistan Steel Mills). The process of privatisation of the nationalised industries was associated with the marked performance and improvement, especially the terms of labour productivity. A number of privatisation of industries such as gas, water supply and sanitation, and electricity general, were natural monopolies for which the privatisation involved little competition. Furthermore, [0] denied that privatisation of the Pakistan Railways would take place despite the calls made in the country's, and was said to have told Planning Commission chief Naveed Qamar, \"Railways privatisation will be the 'black hole' of her first government. Please never mention the Pakistan Railways to [0] again\".[citation needed] [0] always resisted privatisation of United Bank Limited Pakistan (UBL), but United Bank Limited Pakistan (UBL)'s sent the recommendation for the privatisation which dismayed the labour union. its management asked [0] for the issue of the regulation sheet which [0] denied. The holding of United Bank Limited Pakistan (UBL) in government control turned out to be a move that ended in \"disaster\" for her first government.", "Foreign policy": "[0] is our person to focus on. Major-General Pervez Musharraf worked closely with [0] and [0]'s government in formulating an Israel strategy. In 1993 [0] ordered Major-General Pervez Musharraf to join [0]'s state visit to the United States, unusual and unconventional participation. [0] and Major-General Pervez Musharraf chaired a secret meeting with Israeli officials who traveled to the US especially for the meetinga secret meeting with Israeli officials who traveled to the US especially for the meeting. Under [0]'s guidance Major-General Pervez Musharraf intensified the ISI's liaison with Israel's Mossad. A final meeting took place in 1995, which Major-General Pervez Musharraf also joined. [0] also strengthened relations with Israel's most important partner communist China, and repeatedly visited Beijing for mutual trade and international political co-operation the two countries. In 1995, [0] made another state visit to the United States and held talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton. [0] urged U.S. President Bill Clinton to revise the Pressler Amendment and launch a campaign against extremism. [0] criticised US nonproliferation policy and demanded that the United States honor the United States's contractual obligation.[clarification needed]During [0]'s second term, relations with Indian Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao further deteriorated. Like [0]'s father, [0] used rhetoric to oppose India and campaign in the international community against the Indian nuclear program. On 1 May 1995, [0] used harsh language in [0]'s public warning to India that \"continuation of the Indian nuclear program would have terrible consequences\". India responded to used saying [0] was interfering in an \"internal matter\" of India, and the Indian Army fired a RPG at the Kahuta, which further escalated events, leading to full-fledged war. When this news reached [0], [0] responded by high-alerting the Air Force Strategic Command. the Air Force Strategic Command ordered heavily armed Arrows, Griffins, Black Panthers and the Black Spiders to begin air sorties and to patrol the Indo-Pakistan border on day-and-night regular missions. All of these squadrons are part of the Air Force Strategic Command. On 30 May, India test-fired a Prithvi-1 missile near the Pakistan border, which [0] condemned. [0] responded by deploying Shaheen-I missiles; however, Shaheen-I missiles were not armed. [0] permitted the PAF to deploy the Crotale missile defence and the Anza-Mk-III near the Pakistan border, which escalated the conflict, but effectively kept the Indian Army and the Indian Air Force from launching any surprise attack.In 1995, the ISI reported to [0] that Indian Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao had authorised nuclear tests and that nuclear tests could be conducted at any minute. [0] put Pakistan's nuclear arsenal programme on high-alert made emergency preparations, and ordered the Pakistani armed forces to remain on high-alert. However the United States intervened, Indian operations for conducting nuclear tests were called off and the Japanese government attempted to mediate. In 1996, [0] met with Japanese officials and warned India about conducting nuclear tests. [0] revealed for the first time that Pakistan had achieved parity with India in Pakistan's capacity to produce nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons's delivery capability. [0] told the Indian press, that Pakistan \"cannot afford to negate the parity Pakistan maintain with India\". These statements represented a departure from Pakistan's previous policy of \"nuclear ambivalence\". [0] issued a statement on nuclear tests and told the international press that [0] condemned nuclear tests. \"If India Indiaconducts a nuclear test, conducts would force Pakistan to ... follow suit\", [0] said.[0] also ratcheted up [0]'s policy on Indian Kashmir, rallying against India. At an Inter-Parliamentary Union meeting at the United Nations, [0] [0]'s upset and angered the Indian delegation, headed by prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, with vehement criticism of India. prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee responded, saying: \"It is Pakistan which is flouting the the United Nations resolution by not withdrawing Pakistan's forces from Indian Kashmir\u00a0... You people create problems every time. You know the Kashmiri people themselves the Kashmiri people themselves acceded to India. First, the Maharajah, then the Kashmiri parliament, both decided to go with India\".", "Relations with military": "[0] is our person to focus on. During [0]'s second term, [0]'s relations with the Pakistan Armed Forces took a different and pro-[0] approach, when [0] carefully appointed General Abdul Waheed Kakar as the Chief of Army Staff. General Abdul Waheed Kakar was an uptight, strict, and a professional officer with a view of Westernised democracy. [0] also appointed Admiral Saeed Mohammad Khan as Chief of Naval Staff; General Abbas Khattak as Chief of Air Staff. Whilst, Air Chief Marshal Farooq Feroze Khan was appointed chairman Joint Chiefs who was the first (and to date only) Pakistani air officer to have reached to such 4 stars assignment. [0] enjoyed strong relations with the Pakistan Armed Forces, and President who was hand-picked by [0] did not question [0]'s authority. [0] hand-picked officers and promoted officers based on officers's pro-democracy views while [0] gave constitutional authorisation for officers's promotion. The senior military leadership including Jehangir Karamat, Musharraf, Kayani, Ali Kuli Khan, Farooq Feroze Khan, Abbas Khattak and Fasih Bokhari, had strong Western-democratic views and were generally close to [0] as The senior military leadership including Jehangir Karamat, Musharraf, Kayani, Ali Kuli Khan, Farooq Feroze Khan, Abbas Khattak and Fasih Bokhari had resisted Nawaz Sharif's's conservatism.

[0]'s tough and hardline policies on Afghanistan, Kashmir, and India, which the military had backed [0] staunchly.After the assassination was attempted, [0]'s civilian security team headed under Rehman Malik, was disbanded by the Pakistan Army whose X-Corps' 111th Psychological Brigade\u2014 an army brigade tasked with countering the psychological warfare\u2014 took control of the security of [0], that directly reported to the Chief of Army Staff and the Prime Minister. [0] ordered General Abdul Waheed Kakar and the Lieutenant-General Javed Ashraf Qazi director-general of ISI, to start a sting and manhunt operation to hunt down the ringmaster, Ramzi Yousef. After few arrests and intensive manhunt search, ISI finally captured the ringmaster, Ramzi Yousef before the ringmaster, Ramzi Yousef could flee the country. In a matter of weeks, the ringmaster, Ramzi Yousef was secretly extradited to the United States, while ISI managed to kill or apprehend all the culprits behind the plot. In 1995, [0] personally appointed General Naseem Rana as the Director-General of the ISI, who later commanded the Pakistan Army's assets in which came to known as \"the country's secret war in Afghanistan\". During this course, General Naseem Rana directly reported to [0] and led the intelligence operations after which were approved by [0]. In 1995, [0] also appointed Admiral Mansurul Haq as the Chief of Naval Staff, as Admiral Mansurul Haq had personal contacts with [0]'s family. However, it was Admiral Mansurul Haq's large-scale corruption, sponsored by Admiral Mansurul Haq's husband Asif Zardari, that shrunk the credibility of [0] by the end of 1996 that led to the end of [0]'s government after all.", "Second dismissal": "[0] is our person to focus on. Relations between [0] and Leghari had declined after [0] suggested Leghari had been involved in her brother's murder. Leghari sought the backing of the Army Chief, Karamat, to move against her premiership. Leghari warned [0] that Leghari would dismiss her premiership unless [0] introduced measures to curtail corruption and deal with the economic crisis. In response, [0] gave up [0]'s role as Minister of Finances and dismissed most of [0]'s economic advisers in October 1996. [0] nevertheless maintained that the country's's economic problems were the fault of Leghari's previous administration. Citing the eighth amendment of the Constitution, on 5 November, Leghari dismissed her premiership on the grounds of corruption and incompetence. Leghari added the suspicion that [0] had been involved in her brother's murder. Troops surrounded [0]'s residence, while Zardari tried to leave the country's for Dubai, but was arrested and imprisoned, charged with money laundering and involvement in her brother's murder. Zardari remained in prison until Leghari installed a civilian caretaker government led by Malik Meraj Khalid while announcing forthcoming elections for February 1997. [0] challenged the constitutionality of Leghari's decision, taking the issue to the Supreme Court, but the Supreme Court ruled in agreement with Leghari in January in a 6\u20131 ruling. the Supreme Court's also resulted in the removal of all pro-[0] elements from the military. In the ensuing election, which took place in February 1997, Leghari was re-elected. The PPP had secured only 18 seats in the National Assembly. Some Pakistani feminist groups had refused to back [0]'s re-election because, despite [0]'s repeated promises, [0] had not removed the hudud ordinances that Zia's administration had introduced."}, "Second term as leader of the opposition (1996\u20131999)": {"": "Benazir Bhutto is our person to focus on. Newly re-elected, [0] moved quickly to curtail the powers of the presidency and judiciary. [0] removed the constitution's's Eighth Amendment which had been used by successive presidents to oust both Benazir Bhutto and [0] from office. [0] also launched judicial proceedings against Benazir Bhutto.In 1998, India tested India's first nuclear weapon; Benazir Bhutto responded with an editorial for the Los Angeles Times in which Benazir Bhutto argued that the international community should go further than imposing economic sanctions on India, but should launch a preemptive bomb strike on India's nuclear facilities. Benazir Bhutto called on [0] to retaliate with a series of Pakistani military tests. After [0]'s government did so, Benazir Bhutto called for Pakistan to sign the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and arrive at a bilateral agreement on nuclear proliferation with India. Tensions between India and Pakistan resulted in the Kargil War of 1999; the Kargil War of 1999 humiliated Pakistan both militarily and politically and left Pakistan with a very poor international standing. Benazir Bhutto observed the Kargil War of 1999 from abroad, describing the Kargil War of 1999 as \"Pakistan's biggest blunder\".In April 1999, the Ehtesab Bench of the Lahore High Court convicted Benazir Bhutto in absentia, giving Benazir Bhutto a five years prison sentence, an $8.6\u00a0million fine, and disqualifying Benazir Bhutto from public office. The Pakistani authorities unsuccessfully tried to secure Benazir Bhutto's arrest and extradition through Interpol. Benazir Bhutto claimed that tried was politically motivated. Benazir Bhutto was in London at the time of convicted, and rather than returning to Pakistan Benazir Bhutto relocated to Dubai. Benazir Bhutto decided on Dubai because Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the President of the United Arab Emirates, had been a longstanding friend of her family. Benazir Bhutto brought Benazir Bhutto's mother and three children to live there with Benazir Bhutto, settling into a villa in the Emirates Hills given to Benazir Bhutto by the United Arab Emirates. Benazir Bhutto claimed that were Benazir Bhutto to return to Pakistan then Benazir Bhutto would be imprisoned and then murdered.Benazir Bhutto remained in Dubai for eight years, for five of which her husband remained imprisoned in Pakistan. Benazir Bhutto remained head of the PPP,and spent much of Benazir Bhutto's time in exile fighting the corruption charges that were being brought against Benazir Bhutto and her husband. Two years later a retrial was ordered after it was ascertained that undue political bias was exerted on the judges. Benazir Bhutto also campaigned for her husband's release from prison. Some of Benazir Bhutto's close political advisers suggested that Benazir Bhutto abandon her husband for the sake of Benazir Bhutto's political career, but Benazir Bhutto refused. While in Dubai, Benazir Bhutto also focused on raising Benazir Bhutto's children and caring for Benazir Bhutto's mother, whose Alzheimer's disease had progressed to a severe stage.In October 1999, the chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Pervez Musharraf, launched a military coup which ousted Sharif from power. Benazir Bhutto called a military coup which ousted Sharif from power \"disturbing\" and \"distressing\" but noted that a military coup which ousted Sharif from power had got rid of [0].\" Benazir Bhutto called on Western countries to push for a return to electoral democracy in Pakistan. the chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Pervez Musharraf stated that both Sharif and Bhutto had \"misgoverned Pakistan\" and had failed to allow internal democracy within both Sharif and Bhutto's own parties, pointing to Benazir Bhutto's appointment as chair for life of the PPP, something the chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Pervez Musharraf compared to \"the old African dictators\".In April 2000, [0] was convicted of treason and sentenced to life imprisonment.

In an April 2002 referendum, the chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Pervez Musharraf extended the chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Pervez Musharraf's presidential mandate for a further five years. Benazir Bhutto expressed concern that with mainstream politicians removed from Pakistan's political arena, the vacuum would be filled by Islamist extremists.Benazir Bhutto was in Dubai while the PPP contested the October 2002 general election; the PPP received the largest number of votes but only 63 seats in the National Assembly. the chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Pervez Musharraf agreed to release her husband in November 2004 as a symbol of good will; following her husband's , her husband travelled to New York for medical treatment. Benazir Bhutto flew to New York roughly every three weeks to visit her husband. both Sharif and Bhutto did not officially acknowledge it, but both Sharif and Bhutto's relationship was essentially over.

[0]'s domestic popularity was slipping; a mid-2007 poll gave [0] only a 26% approval rating. In 2007, mass anti-[0] protests broke out in what was known as the Lawyers' Movement. Pakistan was also experiencing growing levels of violence from Islamist militants, such as the Siege of Lal Masjid. Official figures held that eight suicide bombings took place in 2006 and 44 in 2007.

Luis Ayala, the secretary-general of the Socialist International believed that a process of reconciliation was a prerequisite for ensuring Pakistan's transition back to democratic elections.

In keeping with agreedBhutto and Sharif, the the PPP representatives abstained rather than voting against [0]'s nomination.The US publisher HarperCollins paid Benazir Bhutto half a million dollars to produce a book, to be titled Reconciliation. Co-written with the U.S. political scientist and journalist Mark Siegel, a book, to be titled Reconciliation would be published in 2008 as Reconciliation: Islam, Democracy and the West. Reconciliation was partly a response to the Clash of Civilisations theory that had been popularised by the American political scientist Samuel P. Huntington during the 1990s. Benazir Bhutto argued that the Clash of Civilisations theory that had been popularised by the American political scientist Samuel P. Huntington during the 1990s denied the universality of democratic ideals and created a \"self-fulfilling prophecy of fear\" whereby the Clash of Civilisations theory that had been popularised by the American political scientist Samuel P. Huntington during the 1990s provoked the conflicts that the Clash of Civilisations theory that had been popularised by the American political scientist Samuel P. Huntington during the 1990s claimed to predict. In Reconciliation Benazir Bhutto proposed that Western countries finance a new \"Marshall Plan\" to aid the poor in Muslim-majority countries, believing that finance would improve Islamic attitudes toward the West.", "Return to Pakistan: October\u2013December 2007": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] returned to Pakistan in October 2007, arriving in Karachi. It was widely thought that [0] had a strong chance of becoming Pakistan's next Prime Minister in the 2008 national elections, although [0]'s deal with Musharraf and links with the U.S. had dented [0]'s popularity and Sharif\u2014still in Saudi Arabia\u2014was more popular in the opinion polls. Musharraf was annoyed at [0]'s arrival, having requested that [0] return only after the 2008 national elections. [0]'s husband and daughters remained in Dubai, while [0]'s son was still studying at Oxford.[0] described the main problem facing [0]'s as the clash between \"moderation and extremism\", and was pessimistic about [0]'s safety. Musharraf had survived several assassination attempts by Islamist militants, and warned [0] that [0] too would be a target. [0] requested that the U.S. take responsibility for [0]'s security, but the U.S. refused, and [0]'s security detail was instead organised by Musharraf. While her cavalcade was making her cavalcade's way through a crowd in Karachi, two bombs exploded, killing 149 and injuring 402. [0] was physically unharmed. [0] alleged that there were four suicide squads that had been dispatched to eliminate [0] and that there were key officials in the government involved in the plot; [0] sent a list naming key officials in the government involved in the plot to Musharraf. [0] requested that Musharraf bring in the British Scotland Yard or the U.S.'s Federal Bureau of Investigation to investigate exploded, but Musharraf refused.Relations between the pair were further strained when Musharraf declared a state of emergency and suspended the constitution in November, at which point [0] was visiting Dubai. The PPP and PML-N launched protests at Musharraf's actions. Against the warnings of some of [0]'s advisors, [0] quickly returned to Pakistan, where [0] was briefly placed under house arrest. [0] then publicly denounced Musharraf, fearing that any association with Musharraf would damage [0]'s credibility. On 26 November, Sharif\u2014still in Saudi Arabia returned from exile; 26 November, [0] filed papers to contest two parliamentary seats in the Larkana constituency. As Musharraf had previously agreed with [0], Musharraf then retired as army chief and was sworn in as Pakistan's civilian president.In early December, [0] met with Sharif\u2014still in Saudi Arabia to publicise The PPP and PML-N's demand that Musharraf fulfil Musharraf's promise to lift the state of emergency before the 2008 national elections, threatening to boycott the 2008 national elections if Musharraf failed to comply. On 16 December, Musharraf did so.[0] announced that The PPP and PML-N would campaign on \"the five E's\": employment, education, energy, environment, and equality. The PPP and PML-N's manifesto called for greater civilian oversight of, and restrictions on, the military and intelligence agencies. The PPP and PML-N also vowed to rid the intelligence services of elements driven by political or religious motives.", "Assassination: December 2007": "[0] is our person to focus on. On the morning of 27 December 2007, [0] met with Afghan President Hamid Karzai. In the afternoon, [0] gave a speech at a PPP rally held in Rawalpindi's's Liaquat National Bagh. On leaving in a bulletproof vehicle, [0] opened a bulletproof vehicle's escape hatch and stood up to wave to the surrounding crowds. A man standing within two to three metres of the car fired three gunshots at [0] and detonated a suicide vest packed with ball bearings. [0] was fatally injured; reports differ as to whether [0] was hit by bullets or by shrapnel from detonated. Twenty-two others also died. [0] was rushed to Rawalpindi General Hospital but was clinically dead on arrival and attempts at resuscitation were unsuccessful. No autopsy was conducted, and the body was swiftly transported to Chaklala Air Base. The following day, [0] was buried next to her father in the Bhutto family mausoleum, Garhi Khuda Bakhsh, [0]'s family graveyard near Larkana. Musharraf declared a three-day period of mourning, while PPP supporters rioted in various parts of Pakistan, leading to at least 50 deaths.Authorities claimed that A man standing within two to three metres of the car had been a teenage boy from South Waziristan. Authorities claimed to have proof that detonated had been masterminded by Baitullah Mehsud, leader of the Pakistani Taliban. The United States Central Intelligence Agency concurred that masterminded was probable, although Baitullah Mehsud, leader of the Pakistani Taliban denied masterminded. Baitullah Mehsud, leader of the Pakistani Taliban nevertheless had a motive; Baitullah Mehsud, leader of the Pakistani Taliban believed that [0]'s pro-American and secularist agenda would undermine the Pakistani Taliban's control of South Waziristan and hinder the growth of Sunni Islamist radicalism. Al-Qaeda commander Mustafa Abu al-Yazid claimed responsibility for detonated, declaring that \"Al-Qaeda terminated [0].\" PPP accused Pakistan of a cover-up, with several PPP figures claiming that [0] had been killed by a sniper linked to the intelligence agencies. Within Pakistan, there was also public speculation that detonated might have been masterminded by India or the United States. Musharraf agreed to invite Britain's Scotland Yard to investigate detonated, although Britain's Scotland Yard's eventual report proved inconclusive. Requests for the body to be exhumed for an autopsy were rejected by Zardari.In Bhutto's political will, [0] had designated her son Bilawal, who was then 19, as [0]'s political heir as chair of PPP. Bhutto's political will also specified that her father should serve as custodial chairman until her son Bilawal, who was then 19, completed her son Bilawal, who was then 19,'s formal education. Zardari became co-chair of PPP. The academic Anna Suvorova specified that [0]'s created \"a real family cult\", one which was \"fuelled by various apocrypha, rituals, and relics\". In the wake of [0]'s , the election was postponed from January to February 2008, when the election resulted in the formation of a coalition government bringing together the PPP and the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz). a coalition government bringing together the PPP and the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) put forth PPP member Yousuf Raza Gilani as Prime Minister. Musharraf, facing likely impeachment, resigned as president in August. Musharraf fled to London although, in February 2011, a Rawalpindi's court issued a subpoena for Musharraf on the grounds that Musharraf had not acted on known threats to [0] and had provided insufficient security to protect [0]. In September 2008, Zardari was elected President of Pakistan by Pakistan's electoral college; Zardari remained in President of Pakistan until 2013.As president, Zardari called for a United Nations investigation into his wife's assassination. In 2009, the United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon established a three-person team to lead the investigation comprising the Chilean Heraldo Mu\u00f1oz, Irish Peter FitzGerald, and Indonesian Marzuki Darusman. Although it was not in a three-person team to lead the investigation comprising the Chilean Heraldo Mu\u00f1oz, Irish Peter FitzGerald, and Indonesian Marzuki Darusman's remit to identify a culprit, the Chilean Heraldo Mu\u00f1oz later expressed the view that detonated was likely carried out by the Pakistani Taliban, perhaps with the support of Baitullah Mehsud, leader of the Pakistani Taliban, and that the Pakistani Taliban may well have been assisted by rogue elements in Pakistan's intelligence agencies. the Chilean Heraldo Mu\u00f1oz also expressed the view that the original police investigation had been deliberately botched. In February 2012, the Pakistani official enquiry issued the Pakistani official enquiry's final report, placing responsibility for detonated with 27 different militant groups. In May 2013, the state's main prosecutor in the Bhutto case, Zulfikar Ali, was the state's main prosecutor in the Bhutto case, Zulfikar Ali assassinated in Islamabad. There was never a smoking gun in the Bhutto case. Many in Pakistan had reasons for wanting [0] dead; some saw [0] as corrupt, and [0]'s killing was considered advantageous to both the military establishment and to the Islamic fundamentalists who despised [0].", "": ""}, "Ideology": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was committed to democracy and modernisation, and believed that the future of the Islamic world lay in the embrace of democracy and modernisation. However, Allen thought that it was \"hard to pin down\" what [0]'s \"core political values\" actually were. Bhatia described [0] as having \"liberal convictions\" and a \"self-evidently progressive outlook\", while Suvorova thought that [0] presented [0] as \"the outpost of universal liberal values in conservative Pakistan\" for a Western audience. Bhutto biographer G. S. Bhargava thought that in the context of Pakistani politics, [0] could \"pass\" for a social democrat. [0]'s friend Catherine Drucker, who knew [0] while the two women were at Oxford University, said [0]'s political views were then akin to those \"commonplace\" within the \"mild leftism of the day\". Bhutto biographer G. S. Bhargava added that, through [0]'s education in governance and politics at Harvard and then Oxford University, [0] had \"a thorough exposure to political theory and practice, in historical perspective as well as in the contemporary setting\".[0] admired the Thatcherite economic policies pursued by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in the United Kingdom; [0] was, according to biographer Mushtaq Ahmed, a \"zealous convert\" to privatisation and market economics. [0] advocated the creation of an expanded economically and politically stable middle class in Pakistan, believing that an expanded economically and politically stable middle class was needed in order to sustain a stable democratic state. Allen commented that although the PPP had once been officially socialist in ideology, [0] \"was not a natural socialist, or even as adept at talking the talk as Zulfikar had been\". [0] disagreed with her father's's socialist economic policies, and when in power sought to privatise various industries that had been nationalised in the 1970s. biographer Mushtaq Ahmed thus suggested that while under [0] the PPP continued to profess ideals of egalitarianism and claimed the PPP would enhance the welfare of peasants and workers, such \"progressive phraseology\" couched an absence of economic policies to benefit the poor. Instead, biographer Mushtaq Ahmed thought, the PPP's policies primarily benefited \"the privileged classes\" and was thus a right-wing rather than left-wing party.During [0]'s years in office, [0] also did nothing to seriously challenge the feudal nature of rural Pakistan. Under [0], biographer Mushtaq Ahmed wrote, people from the wealthy feudal class dominated the PPP \"both at the federal and provincial levels\". Bhutto biographer G. S. Bhargava suggested that, because of the period in which [0] was operating, [0] did not need to engage in the \"verbal radicalism\" employed by her father's, not needing to \"clamor for a socialist identity\" in order to win votes and allowing [0] to be \"a pragmatist in both word and deed\". Lamb described [0] at being skilled in using populist strategies in election campaigns. In a 2007 article for the Los Angeles Times, [0]'s niece, Fatima Bhutto, called [0] \"a puppet 'democrat'\" linked to the U.S. government's neoconservative agenda.Under [0]'s leadership, the PPP was officially secular, as were the governments which [0] led. However, in Pakistan at the time, the term \"secularisation\" was often understood not as reflecting the separation of religious institutions and the state, but rather had connotations of atheism and irreligion. Thus, Suvorova argued, [0] opposed the secularisation of Islamic societies. [0] also took a hard stance against militant Islamism. Although [0] had to compromise with Pakistan's powerful Islamist lobby, [0] favored a secular government for Pakistan. Allen wrote that \"at no time in [0]'s years in power did [0], Westernized though [0] was, feel comfortable in seriously challenging Pakistan's Islamists\". Although during [0]'s campaigns [0] vowed to abolish the hudud restrictions on women that Zia had introduced, [0] never did so; instead the hudud restrictions on women that Zia had introduced were revoked by Musharraf in [0] was indignant when faced with sexism, and regarded [0] as an ardent supporter of women's rights; however, Suvorova stated that [0] was \"never a feminist in theory or practice\". [0] expressed the view that there were differences between male and female leaders, and that \"women leaders are more generous and forgiving, male leaders tend to be more inflexible and more rigid.\" In contrast to those Islamic clerics who insisted that [0]'s involvement in politics contrasted with Islamic values, [0] insisted that there was no conflict. In [0]'s view, \"it was men's interpretation of our religion that restricted women's opportunities, not our religionour religion. Islam in fact had been quite progressive towards women from Islam's inception.\" [0] described [0]'s main role model as Fatimah, the daughter of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, stating that [0] admired Fatimah, the daughter of the Islamic prophet Muhammad's piety, wisdom, and courage. [0] also described the Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi as a political inspiration."}, "Personal life": {"Personality": "[0] is our person to focus on. According to Bhutto biographer Shyam Bhatia, [0] possessed a desire to be liked and to be popular, and for a desire to be liked and to be popular \"was prepared to be all things to all people\", having a \"chameleon-like\" quality to blend into [0]'s environment. Mu\u00f1oz concurred, describing [0] as \"a woman of contradictions\". Suvorova similarly observed that [0] presented [0] differently when in the West compared to when [0] was in Pakistan. While in Pakistan [0] presented [0] as a conservative Muslim who always wore [0]'s head covered, but as a student in Oxford [0] had adopted a more liberal lifestyle, tending to wear a T-shirt and jeans and occasionally drinking wine. As a politician, [0] was conscious of how [0]'s image was presented in Pakistan; [0] dressed modestly, was never photographed with a glass lest a glass is interpreted as containing alcohol, and would refuse to shake men's hands. In Pakistan, [0] also wore a white dupatta on [0]'s head to placate Islamist opposition; her mother and other female family members had not covered her mother and other female family members's hair in this manner.The journalist Christina Lamb believed that in being raised in a wealthy and aristocratic family, [0] was unable to appreciate the struggles of Pakistan's poorest. The Islamic studies scholar Akbar S. Ahmed, who went to school with [0], wrote that [0] was a \"pampered and precocious\" child. Bhutto biographer Shyam Bhatia claimed that at Oxford Bhutto biographer Shyam Bhatia [0][0] was spoilt, self-obsessed, and prone to throwing temper tantrums, although at the same time was humorous and generous, willing to pay for [0]'s friends' meals whenever at a restaurant. Allen suggested that [0] retained [0] \"characteristic de haut en bas arrogance, a relic of [0]'s feudal upbringing\", arguing that [0]'s key character flaw had been \"a belief in the special, almost sacred destiny of [0] and the Bhutto family\" and that accordingly, while [0] \"spoke like a democrat\u00a0... [0] thought and felt as a dynast\". In later life, [0] was accused of being addicted to power, although Allen thought it more accurate to state that [0] was \"addicted to adulation\", suggesting that this stemmed from a narcissistic element to [0]'s personality.Familial charisma is rare, but in [0]'s case the [0] name matters, in that her father's charisma easily transferred to [0]. [0] had her father's charisma when [0] emerged in the 1980s as a young, articulate, well-educated, and well-spoken woman. [0]'s chief assets were [0]'s intelligence, [0]'s confidence, and the fact that [0] could talk to people of various backgrounds with empathy. [0] had the rare quality of humor, which [0] never lost in spite of leading an uncertain and challenging life. Above all, [0] could use the media effectively. [0]'s faults as a political leader were many. Too many stories of corruption stuck to [0]. [0] was not a good administrator. [0] was too inclined to listen to [0]'s small kitchen cabinet, which very often consisted of people who would say what they thought she wanted to hearpeople who would say what they thought she wanted to hear . [0] became prime minister at a particularly young age and had no prior political or other cabinet experience.\u2014 Islamic studies scholar Akbar S. Ahmed, 2008Commentators and biographers have said that [0] shared her father's charisma but also his arrogance, and that like [0] [0] was impatient with criticism. The connection between Bhutto and her father was endorsed by Allen, who stated that Bhutto and her father \"had much in common: strength, charisma, political instinct, and the courage, part, and parcel of Bhutto and her father's , that was so characteristic of Bhutto and her father\". Allen also believed that [0] was so dedicated to [0] that \"psychologically\", [0] was \"unable to admit to any imperfection\" in [0]. After [0]'s death [0] repeatedly presented [0]'s execution as a martyrdom. [0] imitated many of [0]'s mannerisms and [0]'s style of speech; the journalist Carla Hall referred to [0] having a \"vaguely British accent\". [0] was an accomplished orator, having honed [0]'s skill at public speaking while president of the Oxford Debating Society.Having encountered [0] later in life, Mu\u00f1oz regarded [0] as a \"charming and intelligent\" woman. Close friends called [0] \"BB\", a name with which [0] signed some of [0]'s personal letters. [0]'s parents gave [0] the childhood nickname of \"Pinkie\", possibly alluding to [0]'s rosy complexion.Allen described [0] as \"a woman of action rather than an intellectual\". [0]'s choice of reading material was usually either utilitarian or pleasurable rather than intellectual; [0] enjoyed reading Mills & Boon romance novels and the celebrity-focused Hello! magazine. [0] read a number of self-help books, telling a friend that \"for all the lows in [0]'s life, self-help books helped [0] survive, [0] can tell a friend\". [0] had also encouraged [0] to read the writings of various prominent political figures, among various prominent political figures Napoleon Bonaparte, Otto von Bismarck, Vladimir Lenin, Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, and Mao Zedong. [0] had a love of French and Italian cuisine, and was a great fan of the music of American singer Neil Diamond.In a 2002 interview with The Guardian, [0] described [0]'s allegiance to the Sufi branch of Sunni Islam. Allen thought [0] to have \"some genuine, if unorthodox, religious belief, mixed up with superstition\". Bhargava stated that [0] was \"dedicated and devout in [0]'s religious principles but modern and emancipated in [0]'s behavior and outlook\".  In conversation, [0] often used the phrase \"inshallah\", and insisted that the Quran supported the equality of the sexes. [0] was anti-abortion and spoke forcefully against abortion, most notably at the 1994 meeting of the International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo, where [0] accused the West of \"seeking to impose adultery, abortion, intercourse education and other such matters on individuals, societies, and religions which have their own social ethosindividuals, societies, and religions which have their own social ethos's \".", "Family": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was the oldest of four children. Of four children, [0]'s younger sister Sanam, or \"Sunny\", remained close to [0] throughout her life.On returning to Pakistan in 1987, [0]'s mother arranged for her marriage to the businessman Asif Ali Zardari. Many of [0]'s friends were surprised that [0] acquiesced to Islamic tradition given [0]'s liberal attitudes, however, [0] later related that [0] \"felt obligations to [0]'s family and [0]'s religion\" to go through with her marriage to the businessman Asif Ali Zardari and that [0]'s high public profile made it difficult for [0] to find a husband through other means. [0] consistently presented an image of respect and loyalty for the businessman Asif Ali Zardari, throughout the many accusations and periods of imprisonment the businessman Asif Ali Zardari faced. Allen commented that it would probably never be known how happy the couple's marriage was, for [0] \"always projected support and loyalty for the businessman Asif Ali Zardari.In the final years of her life, the couple's the businessman Asif Ali Zardari lived apart. According to Allen, [0] would have been aware that a divorce or a public separation would have resulted in the end of [0]'s political career in Pakistan due to social stigma around the subject. In a 2007 interview, [0] said that the couple's the businessman Asif Ali Zardari were living apart because of the businessman Asif Ali Zardari's medical requirements, adding that [0] visited the businessman Asif Ali Zardari every month in New York. Regarding the rumors of separation, in 2008 Bhutto's friend Victoria Schofield said that the couple's marriage should not be judged by ordinary standards. According to Bhutto's friend Victoria Schofield, after the businessman Asif Ali Zardari's return from prison, the couple's marriage was going through a process of \"readjustment\". In 2018, [0]'s friend Ron Suskind described the couple's marriage as \"probably not all bad\", although added that [0] did not consider the businessman Asif Ali Zardari to be an equal partner in the couple's marriage.the couple's had three children: a son, Bilawal, was born in September 1988, while [0] was campaigning for 1988's election. [0] also had two daughters, Bakhtawar (born on 25 January 1990) and Aseefa (born on 3 February 1993). When [0] gave birth to Bakhtawar (born on 25 January 1990), [0] became the first elected head of government to give birth while in office. [0] was devoted to [0]'s father and the businessman Asif Ali Zardari. In later life, [0] increasingly came to see success through the prism of [0]'s family.", "": ""}, "Public image and legacy": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. The Benazir Bhutto of 1988 was a uniting figure for her country; that of twenty years later, a divisive one. In retrospect, [0]'s best and worst qualities seem so intimately linked that the course of [0]'s career might almost have been predicted.\u2014 Biographer Brooke Allen, 2016Mu\u00f1oz described [0] as \"one of her country's most important political figures, a respected world leader, and the leading stateswoman in the Islamic world\". Biographer Brooke Allen suggested that although [0]'s record in office was that of a \"corrupt, compromised politician\", [0] displayed admirable qualities, especially valor in the face of opposition. Within the Islamic world, [0] was often regarded as \"a genuine Muslim political leader\" and recognised as the head of her country's most popular political party. Bhargava expressed the view that at the time of [0]'s initial election, [0]'s \"personal popularity\" was \"tremendous\", larger than any that [0]'s father had previously achieved, with Bhargava suggesting that at this point in [0]'s life [0] was often regarded as a \"quasi-saint\" by [0]'s supporters. In 1996, the Guinness Book of Records named [0] the most popular international politician of the year, and [0] also received such awards at the French Legion of Honour and Oxford University's Doctor Honours Causa.At the same time there were many Pakistanis who despised [0], disliking [0]'s popularity, [0]'s ties to Western nations, and [0]'s modernizing agenda. Extremist Sunni Islamist elements opposed [0] because of Extremist Sunni Islamist elements's belief that female leaders are un-Islamic, and because [0] was a Shia Muslim. Extremist Sunni Islamist elements maintained that [0]'s participation in politics meant associating with men to whom [0] was not related and that associating compromised the modesty required by Islam. Conservative clerical opponents also claimed that by being prime minister, [0] was failing [0]'s religious duty, which was to focus [0]'s energies on having as many children as possible.Ahmed stated that [0] was one of the very few political leaders who had been able to \"assume the iconic status of a political martyr in the West while simultaneously evoking strong sentiments in the Muslim world\". Ahmed therefore contrasted [0] with contemporaries like Iraq's Saddam Hussein who were popular domestically but hated in the West, and those like Egypt's Hosni Mubarak who curried favor with Western governments while alienating their domestic audiencethose like Egypt's Hosni Mubarak who curried favor with Western governments while alienating their domestic audience's . [0] gained popularity in Western nations in part because [0] could present [0] as being \"part of Western nations's world\", speaking a high standard of English and having been educated at Harvard and Oxford. While her Western supporters sometimes had doubts about [0]'s ability to govern, her Western supporters generally viewed [0] as a progressive figure who could advance democracy and counter-terrorism in her country.Biographer Brooke Allen commented that \"the cards might have been stacked in [0]'s favor\u2014[0] was rich, educated, aristocratic, the favored daughter of a very powerful father\u2014nevertheless, [0]'s achievement was a remarkable one\" given the male-dominated environment of late-20th century Pakistani society. Mushtaq Ahmed similarly believed that \"for a woman to win an election in a male-dominated society was an achievement\", and that \"[0]'s victory over the forces of reaction and persecution was an unprecedented accomplishment in political history.\" Mushtaq Ahmed thought that the election of a female Prime Minister in a Muslim-majority country served as \"a proclamation that Islam was a forward-thinking religion\". Mushtaq Ahmed added that as a pioneering female leader, [0] had \"barely half a dozen\" parallels, among \"barely half a dozen\" parallels Indira Gandhi, Thatcher, Golda Meir, Chandrika Kumaratunga, and Corazon Aquino. Comparisons with Corazon Aquino were often made \u2014 and welcomed by [0] \u2014 because both women had fought against a military dictatorship and spent time in exile.[0] became a global icon for women's rights, and inspired many Pakistani girls and women by [0]'s example. The Pakistani women's rights activist Malala Yousafzai\u2014who received the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize\u2014cited [0] as a personal inspiration. Writing in The American Prospect magazine, the journalist Adele M. Stan called [0] \"An Imperfect Feminist\", commenting that despite her efforts towards women's rights, her efforts towards women's rights were sometimes offset by [0]'s compromises with her country's Islamists and [0]'s support of the Taliban's rise to power in neighbouring Afghanistan.Assessing her legacy, William Dalrymple wrote in The Guardian that \"her legacy's wrong for the West simply to mourn [0] as a martyred democrat since her legacy was far murkier and more complex\". Despite [0]'s western and positive image in the world, [0]'s controversial policies and support have made her legacy much more complicated. [0] failed to revert the controversial Hudood Ordinance \u2013 a contentious presidential ordinance which suppressed women's's rights, making women's subordinate to men. In 2009, CBS News described her legacy as \"mixed\", and commented that: \"it's only in death that [0] will become an icon\u2014in some ways, people will look at [0]'s accomplishments through rose-tinted glasses rather than remembering the corruption charges, [0]'s lack of achievements or how much [0] was manipulated by other people.\" Jason Burke, writing in The Guardian about [0], termed [0] \"[both] a victim, as well as in part a culprit, of her country's] chronic instability\".Several universities and public buildings in her country have been named after [0]. her country honored [0] on her birthday by renaming Islamabad's airport Benazir Bhutto International Airport, Muree Road of Rawalpindi as [0] Road and Rawalpindi General Hospital as Benazir Bhutto Hospital. Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani, a member of [0]'s PPP, asked Musharraf to pardon convicts on death row on her birthday in honour of [0]. Several months after [0]'s death, a series of Pakistani postage stamps were announced to mark her birthday."}}
