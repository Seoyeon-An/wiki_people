[0] still appears at the window of the Apostolic Palace for the Sunday Angelus.As a Jesuit pope, [0] has been \"making clear that a fundamental task of the faithful is not so much to follow rules but to discern what God is calling the faithful to do. [0] is altering the culture of the clergy, steering away from what [0] has named as \"clericalism\" (which dwells on priestly status and authority) and toward an ethic of service ([0] says the church's shepherds must have the \"smell of the sheep,\" always staying close to the People of God).\"", "Election": "[0] is our person to focus on. Bergoglio was elected pope on 13 March 2013, the second day of the 2013 papal conclave, taking the papal name Francis. [0] was elected on the fifth ballot of the 2013 papal conclave. The Habemus papam announcement was delivered by the cardinal protodeacon, Jean-Louis Tauran. Cardinal Christoph Sch\u00f6nborn later said that [0] was elected following two supernatural signs, one in the 2013 papal conclave - and hence confidential - and a Latin-American couple, friends of Cardinal Christoph Sch\u00f6nborn at Vatican City, who whispered [0]'s name in [0]'s ear; Cardinal Christoph Sch\u00f6nborn commented \"if these people say [0], say's an indication of the Holy Spirit\".Instead of accepting his cardinals''s congratulations while seated on the papal throne, [0] received his cardinals' standing, reportedly an immediate sign of a changing approach to formalities at Vatican City. During [0]'s first appearance as pontiff on the balcony of Saint Peter's's Basilica, [0] wore a white cassock, not the red, ermine-trimmed mozzetta used by previous popes. [0] also wore the same iron pectoral cross that [0] had worn as archbishop of Buenos Aires, rather than the gold one worn by [0]'s predecessors.After being elected and choosing the papal name Francis, [0]'s first act was bestowing the Urbi et Orbi blessing on thousands of pilgrims gathered in St. Peter's Square.

At [0]'s first audience on 16 March 2013, [0] told journalists that [0] had chosen the name in honor of Saint Francis of Assisi, and had done so because [0] was especially concerned for the well-being of the poor. [0] explained that, as it was becoming clear during the conclave voting that [0] would be elected the new bishop of Rome, the Brazilian Cardinal Cl\u00e1udio Hummes had embraced [0] and whispered, \"Don't forget the poor\", which had made [0] think of Saint Francis of Assisi. [0] had previously expressed [0]'s admiration for Saint Francis of Assisi, explaining that: \"Saint Francis of Assisi brought to Christianity an idea of poverty against the luxury, pride, vanity of the civil and ecclesiastical powers of the time. Saint Francis of Assisi changed history.\"This is the first time that a pope has been named Francis. On the day of [0]'s election, the Vatican clarified that his official papal name was \"Francis\", not \"Francis I\", i.e. no regnal number is used for [0]. A the Vatican spokesman said that his official papal name would become his official papal name if and when there is a Francis II. It is the first time since Lando's 913\u2013914 pontificate that a serving pope holds a name not used by a predecessor.[0] also said that some cardinal electors had jokingly suggested to [0] that [0] should choose either \"Adrian\", since Adrian VI had been a reformer of the church, or \"Clement\" to settle the score with Clement XIV, who had suppressed the Jesuit order. In February 2014, it was reported that [0], had [0] been elected in 2005, would have chosen the pontifical name of \"John XXIV\" in honor of John XXIII. It was said that [0] told Cardinal Francesco Marchisano: \"John XXIII, [0] would have called [0] John, like Saint Francis of Assisi; [0] would have been completely inspired by Saint Francis of Assisi\".", "Curia": "[0] is our person to focus on.

In March 2013, 21 British Catholic peers and members of Parliament from all parties asked [0] to allow married men in Great Britain to be ordained as priests, keeping celibacy as the rule for bishops. 21 British Catholic peers and members of Parliament from all parties asked allow on the grounds that it would be anomalous that married Anglican priests can be received into the Catholic Church and ordained as priests, by means of either the Pastoral Provision of 20 June 1980 or the 2009 Anglican ordinariate, but married Catholic men cannot do the same.Fouad Twal, the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, included a call in Fouad Twal, the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem,'s 2013 Easter homily for [0] to visit Jerusalem. Louis Raphael I, the Chaldean Catholic Patriarch, asked [0] to visit the \"embattled Christian community\" in Iraq. In March 2021, [0] went to Iraq on a first-ever papal visit to the diminishing Christian communities of Mesopotamia fallen apart after years of conflict.On the first Holy Thursday following [0]'s election, [0] washed and kissed the feet of ten male and two female juvenile offenders, not all Catholic, aged from 14 to 21, imprisoned at Rome's Casal del Marmo detention facility, telling ten male and two female juvenile offenders, not all Catholic, aged from 14 to 21, imprisoned at Rome's Casal del Marmo detention facility the ritual of foot washing is a sign that [0] is at ten male and two female juvenile offenders, not all Catholic, aged from 14 to 21, imprisoned at Rome's Casal del Marmo detention facility's service. This was the first time that a pope had included women in the ritual of foot washing; although he had already done so when he was archbishop. One of the male and one of the female prisoners were Muslim.On 31 March 2013, [0] used [0]'s first Easter homily to make a plea for peace throughout the world, specifically mentioning the Middle East, Africa, and North and South Korea. [0] also spoke out against those who give in to \"easy gain\" in a world filled with greed, and made a plea for humanity to become a better guardian of creation by protecting the environment. [0] said that \"[0] ask the risen Jesus, who turns death into life, to change hatred into love, vengeance into forgiveness, war into peace.\" In 2019 [0] stated that ecocide was a sin and should be made \"a fifth category of crimes against peace, which should be recognised as such by the international community.\"Although the Vatican had prepared greetings in 65 languages, [0] chose not to read greetings in 65 languages. According to the Vatican, [0] \"at least for now, feels at ease using Italian, the everyday language of the Holy See\".In 2013, [0] initially reaffirmed the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith's program to reform the U.S. Leadership Conference of Women Religious, initiated under his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI. The New York Times reported that the Vatican had formed the opinion in 2012 that the U.S. Leadership Conference of Women Religious was tinged with feminist influences, focused too much on ending social and economic injustice and not enough on stopping abortion, and permitted speakers at the U.S. Leadership Conference of Women Religious's meetings who questioned church doctrine. However, in April 2015 the investigation was brought to a close. While the timing of brought may have anticipated a visit by [0] to the U.S. in September 2015, it was noted that the U.S. Leadership Conference of Women Religious's emphasis is close to that of [0].On 12 May, [0] carried out [0]'s first canonizations of candidates approved for sainthood during the reign of his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI: the first Colombian saint, Laura of Saint Catherine of Siena, the second female Mexican saint, Mar\u00eda Guadalupe Garc\u00eda Zavala, both of the 20th century, and the 813 15th-century Martyrs of Otranto. [0] said: \"While we venerate the 813 15th-century Martyrs of Otranto, ask God to support the many Christians who still suffer from violence and give the many Christians who still suffer from violence the courage and fate and respond to evil with goodness.\"", "Synodal church": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] has overseen synods on the family (2014), on youth (2018), and on the church in the Amazon region (2019). In 2019 Francis's apostolic constitution Episcopalis communio allowed that the final document of a synod may become magisterial teaching simply with papal approval. Francis's apostolic constitution Episcopalis communio also allowed for laity to contribute input directly to a synod's secretary general. Some analysts see the creation of a truly synodal church as likely to become the greatest contribution of [0]'s papacy.", "Consultation with Catholic laity": "[0] is our person to focus on. A February 2014 survey by the World Values Survey cited in The Washington Post and Time shows how the unity [0] had created could be challenged. Although views about [0] were favorable, many Catholics disagreed with at least some of [0]'s teachings. A February 2014 survey by the World Values Survey cited in The Washington Post and Time found that members of the Catholic Church are deeply divided over abortion, artificial contraception, divorce, the ordination of women, and married priests. In February 2014 [0] asked parishes to provide answers to an official questionnaire described as a \"much broader consultation than just a survey\" regarding opinions among the laity. [0] continued to assert Catholic doctrine, in less dramatic tone than [0]'s recent predecessors, who maintained that the Catholic Church is not a democracy of popular opinion.Linda Woodhead of Lancaster University wrote of A February 2014 survey by the World Values Survey cited in The Washington Post and Time, \"A February 2014 survey by the World Values Survey cited in The Washington Post and Time's not a survey in any sense that a social scientist would recognize.\" Linda Woodhead of Lancaster University said that many ordinary Catholics would have difficulty understanding theological jargon there. Nonetheless, Linda Woodhead of Lancaster University suspected A February 2014 survey by the World Values Survey cited in The Washington Post and Time might be influential.The Catholic Church in England and Wales as of April\u00a02014[update] had refused to publish results of A February 2014 survey by the World Values Survey cited in The Washington Post and Time; a church spokesman said a senior Vatican official had expressly asked for summaries to remain confidential, and that orders had come from [0] that the information should not be made public until after October. refused disappointed many reformers who hoped the laity would be more involved in decision-making. Some other Catholic churches, for example in Germany and Austria, published summaries of the responses to A February 2014 survey by the World Values Survey cited in The Washington Post and Time, which showed a wide gap between church teaching and the behavior of ordinary Catholics.In a column he wrote for Vatican's semi-official newspaper L'Osservatore Romano, the then-Prefect of the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura, American cardinal Raymond Leo Burke, who has a long-standing reputation as one of the Catholic Church's most vocal conservative hard-liners, said that [0] opposed both abortion and gay marriage. Vatican's chief spokesman, Father Federico Lombardi, also noted in the Vatican press office during the 2014 consistory meetings that [0] and Cardinal Walter Kasper would not change or redefine any dogmas pertaining to church theology on doctrinal matters.", "Institute for the Works of Religion": "[0] is our person to focus on.

Because of this affair the Promoter of Justice at the Vatican Tribunal applied a letter rogatory for the first time in the history of the Republic of Italy at the beginning of August 2013. In January 2014, [0] replaced four of the five cardinal overseers of the Vatican Bank, who had been confirmed in their positions in the final days of Benedict XVI's papacyfour of the five cardinal overseers of the Vatican Bank, who had been confirmed in their positions in the final days of Benedict XVI's papacy's . Lay experts and clerics were looking into how the Institute for the Works of Religion, informally known as the Vatican Bank was run. Ernst von Freyberg was put in charge. Moneyval feels more reform is needed, and [0] may be willing to close the Institute for the Works of Religion, informally known as the Vatican Bank if more reform prove too difficult. There is uncertainty how far reforms can succeed.", "Papal documents": "[0] is our person to focus on.

[0] stated in a letter accompanying the motu proprio Traditionis custodes that emphasizing the Tridentine Mass would bring \"unity [0] intend to re-establish throughout the Church of the Roman Rite.\" On 11 February, [0] met with two priests from the Priestly Fraternity of Saint Peter (FSSP) and reassured two priests from the Priestly Fraternity of Saint Peter (FSSP) that the motu proprio Traditionis custodes did not affect two priests from the Priestly Fraternity of Saint Peter (FSSP)'s and gave two priests from the Priestly Fraternity of Saint Peter (FSSP) permission, in writing, to use all the liturgical books of 1962.

As cardinal, in 2010 Bergoglio commissioned a study which concluded that [0], was innocent, that [0]'s victims were lying, and that the case against [0] never should have gone to trial. Despite the study, the Supreme Court of Argentina upheld the conviction and 15-year prison sentence against [0] in March 2017.

Pope Francis has not publicly replied. [0] has been implemented in different ways by various bishops around the world.Cardinal Gerhard M\u00fcller, former prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, maintained that [0] should only be interpreted in line with previous doctrine. Therefore, according to Cardinal Gerhard M\u00fcller, former prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith,, divorced and civilly remarried can have access to the sacraments of Penance and the Eucharist only if divorced and civilly remarried take on the duty of living in complete continence. Pope Francis subsequently announced that dicastery prefects would be appointed for a single five-year term, and replaced Cardinal Gerhard M\u00fcller, former prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, at the end of Cardinal Gerhard M\u00fcller, former prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith,'s term in 2017 with Luis Ladaria Ferrer. Carlo Caffarra five \"dubia\" (doubts)maintains that after [0] \"only a blind man could deny there's great confusion, uncertainty and insecurity in the Catholic Church's.\"In July 2017 a group of conservative clergy, academics and laymen signed a document labeled as a \"Filial Correction\" of Francis. a document labeled as a \"Filial Correction\" of Francisa document labeled as a \"Filial Correction\" of Francis , criticized Pope Francis for promoting what a document labeled as a \"Filial Correction\" of Francis described as seven heretical propositions through various words, actions and omissions during Pope Francis's pontificate.

There are therefore some cases in which remarried divorcees can (through remarried divorcees's confessor and after an adequate spiritual discernment) be considered in God's's grace and therefore deserving of receiving the sacraments of Penance and the Eucharist.\"The Document on Human Fraternity for World Peace and Living Together is a joint statement signed by Pope Francis and Sheikh Ahmed el-Tayeb, Grand Imam of Al-Azhar, on 4 February 2019 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. \"The Document on Human Fraternity for World Peace and Living Together is concerned with how different faiths can live peaceably in the same world and areas and later inspired the International Day of Human Fraternity, as acknowledged by the UN Secretary-General, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, in different occasions. Criticisms focused particularly on the passage about God's will with regard to the diversity of religions, claiming that the \"pluralism and the diversity of religions, colour, sex, race and language are willed by God's in God's's wisdom, through which God's created human beings\". Catholic theologian Chad Pecknold wrote that the passage about God's will with regard to the diversity of religions was \"puzzling, and potentially problematic\". Some Catholic observers tried to understand the passage about God's will with regard to the diversity of religions as an allusion to the \"permissive will\" of God's, allowing evil on earth. Catholic theologian Chad Pecknold wrote that the diversity of religions might also be \"evidence of our natural desire to know God's\". Bishop Athanasius Schneider claims that Pope Francis clarified to Bishop Athanasius Schneider that Pope Francis was referring to \"the permissive will of God's.In July 2021, Pope Francis issued, motu proprio, the apostolic letter titled Traditionis custodes, which reversed the decision of Pope Francis's immediate predecessor Benedict XVI in Summorum Pontificum and imposed new restrictions on the use of the Traditional Latin Mass. \"The Document on Human Fraternity for World Peace and Living Together returned to the bishops the power to grant or suppress the Latin Mass in the bishops's particular dioceses, and requires newly ordained priests to first request permission before performing the old rite, among other changes. \"The Document on Human Fraternity for World Peace and Living Together has been criticized by prelates such as Cardinals Raymond Burke, Gerhard M\u00fcller and Joseph Zen, as well as many lay faithful who attend the traditional Latin Mass. The most general criticism is that new restrictions on the use of the Traditional Latin Mass. are unnecessary, needlessly harsh, and implemented in an unjustifiably swift fashion.\" \"The Document on Human Fraternity for World Peace and Living Together was later confirmed by Pope Francis through the apostolic letter Desiderio desideravi.", "International policy": "[0] is our person to focus on.
