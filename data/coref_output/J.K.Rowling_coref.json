[0] said Jessica Mitford had \"been [0]'s heroine since [0] was 14 years old, when [0] overheard [0]'s formidable great-aunt discussing how Jessica Mitford had run away at the age of 19 to fight with the Reds in the Spanish Civil War\", and that what inspired [0] about Jessica Mitford was that Jessica Mitford was \"incurably and instinctively rebellious, brave, adventurous, funny and irreverent, Jessica Mitford liked nothing better than a good fight, preferably against a pompous and hypocritical target\". As a child, [0] read C. S. Lewis's's The Chronicles of Narnia, Elizabeth Goudge's's The Little White Horse, Manxmouse by Paul Gallico, and books by E. Nesbit and Noel Streatfeild. [0] describes Jane Austen as [0]'s \"favourite author of all time\".[0] acknowledges Homer, Geoffrey Chaucer, and William Shakespeare as literary influences. Scholars agree that Harry Potter is heavily influenced by the children's fantasy of writers such as C. S. Lewis's, Elizabeth Goudge's, E. Nesbit, J. R. R. Tolkien, Ursula K. Le Guin, and Diana Wynne Jones. According to the critic Beatrice Groves, Harry Potter is also \"rooted in the Western literary tradition\", including the classics. Commentators also note similarities to the children's stories of Enid Blyton and Roald Dahl. [0] expresses admiration for Lewis, in whose writing battles between good and evil are also prominent, but rejects any connection with Roald Dahl.Earlier works prominently featuring characters who learn to use magic include Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea series, in which a school of wizardry also appears, and the Chrestomanci books by Diana Wynne Jones. [0]'s setting of a \"school of witchcraft and wizardry\" departs from the still older tradition of protagonists as apprentices to magicians, exemplified by The Sorcerer's Apprentice: yet this trope does appear in Harry Potter, when Harry Potter receives individual instruction from Remus Lupin and other teachers. [0] also draws on the tradition of stories set in boarding schools, a major example of which is Thomas Hughes's 1857 volume Tom Brown's School Days."}, "Style and themes": {"Style and allusions": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] is known primarily as an author of fantasy and children's literature. [0]'s writing in other genres, including literary fiction and murder mystery, has received less critical attention. Rowling's most famous work, Harry Potter, has been defined as a fairy tale, a Bildungsroman and a boarding-school story. [0]'s other writings have been described by Pugh as gritty contemporary fiction with historical influences (The Casual Vacancy) and hardboiled detective fiction (Cormoran Strike).In Rowling's most famous work, Harry Potter,, [0] juxtaposes the extraordinary against the ordinary. Her narrative features two worlds \u2013 the mundane and the fantastic \u2013 but Her narrative differs from typical portal fantasy in that Her narrative's magical elements stay grounded in the everyday. Paintings move and talk; books bite readers; letters shout messages; and maps show live journeys, making the wizarding world \"both exotic and cosily familiar\" according to the scholar Catherine Butler. This blend of realistic and romantic elements extends to Rowling's characters. Rowling's characters's names often include morphemes that correspond to Rowling's characters's characteristics: Malfoy is difficult, Filch unpleasant and Lupin a werewolf. Harry is ordinary and relatable, with down-to-earth features such as wearing broken glasses; Roni Natov terms Harry an \"everychild\". These elements serve to highlight Harry when Harry is heroic, making Harry both an everyman and a fairytale hero.Arthurian, Christian and fairytale motifs are frequently found in [0]'s writing. Harry's ability to draw the Sword of Gryffindor from the Sorting Hat resembles the Arthurian sword in the stone legend. Harry's life with the Dursleys has been compared to Cinderella. Like C. S. Lewis's's The Chronicles of Narnia, Rowling's most famous work, Harry Potter, contains Christian symbolism and allegory. Rowling's most famous work, Harry Potter, has been viewed as a Christian moral fable in the psychomachia tradition, in which stand-ins for good and evil fight for supremacy over a person's soul. The critic of children's literature Joy Farmer sees parallels between Harry and Jesus Christ. Comparing [0] with C. S. Lewis's, The critic of children's literature Joy Farmer argues that \"magic is both authors' way of talking about spiritual reality\". According to Maria Nikolajeva, Christian imagery is particularly strong in the final scenes of Rowling's most famous work, Harry Potter,: The critic of children's literature Joy Farmer writes that Harry dies in self-sacrifice and Voldemort delivers an ecce homo speech, after which Harry is resurrected and defeats Voldemort.", "Themes": "[0] is our person to focus on. Death is [0]'s overarching theme in Harry Potter. In the first book, when Harry Potter looks into the Mirror of Erised, Harry Potter feels both joy and \"a terrible sadness\" at seeing Harry Potter's desire: his parents, alive and with Harry Potter. Confronting his parents's loss is central to Harry Potter's character arc and manifests in different ways through the series, such as in Harry Potter's struggles with Dementors. Other characters in Harry Potter's life die; Harry Potter even faces Harry Potter's own death in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. the series has an existential perspective \u2013 Harry Potter must grow mature enough to accept death. In Harry's world, death is not binary but mutable, a state that exists in degrees. Unlike Voldemort, who evades death by separating and hiding his soul in seven partsVoldemort, who evades death by separating and hiding his soul in seven parts's , Harry Potter's soul is whole, nourished by friendship and love. Love distinguishes the two characters. Harry Potter is a hero because Harry Potter loves others, even willing to accept death to save others; Voldemort, who evades death by separating and hiding his soul in seven parts is a villain because Voldemort, who evades death by separating and hiding his soul in seven parts does not.While Harry Potter can be viewed as a story about good versus evil, Harry Potter's moral divisions are not absolute. First impressions of characters are often misleading. Harry Potter assumes in the first book that Quirrell is good because Quirrell opposes Snape, who appears malicious; in reality, their positions are reversed. This pattern later recurs with Moody and Snape. In Harry's world, good and evil are choices rather than inherent attributes: second chances and redemption are key themes of the series. This is reflected in Harry Potter's self-doubts after learning Harry Potter's connections to Voldemort, who evades death by separating and hiding his soul in seven parts, such as the ability of the two characters to communicate with snakes in snakes's language of Parseltongue; and prominently in Snape, who appears malicious's characterisation, which has been described as complex and multifaceted. In some scholars' view, while [0]'s narrative appears on the surface to be about Harry Potter, [0]'s focus may actually be on Snape, who appears malicious's morality and character arc.", "": ""}, "Reception": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] has enjoyed enormous commercial success as an author. Her Harry Potter series topped bestseller lists, spawned a global media franchise including films and video games, and had been translated into 84\u00a0languages by 2023. The first three Harry Potter books occupied the top three spots of The New York Times bestseller list for more than a year; The first three Harry Potter books were then moved to a newly created children's list. The final four books each set records as the fastest-selling books in the UK or US, and Her Harry Potter series had sold more than 600\u00a0million copies as of 2023[update]. Neither of [0]'s later works, The Casual Vacancy and the Cormoran Strike series, has been as successful, though Casual Vacancy was still a bestseller in the UK within weeks of Casual Vacancy's release. Harry Potter's popularity has been attributed to factors including the nostalgia evoked by the boarding-school story, the endearing nature of [0]'s characters, and the accessibility of Her Harry Potter series to a variety of readers. According to Julia Eccleshare, Her Harry Potter series are \"neither too literary nor too popular, too difficult nor too easy, neither too young nor too old\", and hence bridge traditional reading divides.Critical response to Harry Potter has been more mixed. Harold Bloom regarded Rowling's prose as poor and [0]'s plots as conventional, while Jack Zipes argues that Her Harry Potter series would not be successful if Her Harry Potter series were not formulaic. Jack Zipes states that The first three Harry Potter books have the same plot: in each book, Harry escapes the Dursleys to visit Hogwarts, where Harry confronts Lord Voldemort and then heads back successful. Rowling's prose has been described as simple and not innovative; Le Guin, like several other critics, considered Rowling's prose \"stylistically ordinary\". According to the novelist A. S. Byatt, Her Harry Potter series reflect a dumbed-down culture dominated by soap operas and reality television. Thus, some critics argue, Harry Potter does not innovate on established literary forms; nor does Harry Potter challenge readers' preconceived ideas. Conversely, the scholar Philip Nel rejects such critiques as \"snobbery\" that reacts to Her Harry Potter series's popularity, whereas Mary Pharr argues that Harry Potter's conventionalism is the point: by amalgamating literary forms familiar to her readers, [0] invites her readers to \"ponder her readers's own ideas\". Other critics who see artistic merit in [0]'s writing include Marina Warner, who views Harry Potter as part of an \"alternative genealogy\" of English literature that she traces from Edmund Spenser to Christina RossettiMarina Warner, who views Harry Potter as part of an \"alternative genealogy\" of English literature that she traces from Edmund Spenser to Christina Rossetti . Michiko Kakutani praises [0]'s fictional world and the darker tone of Her Harry Potter series's later entries.Reception of [0]'s later works has varied among critics. The Casual Vacancy drew mixed reviews. Some critics praised The Casual Vacancy's characterisation, while others stated that The Casual Vacancy would have been better if The Casual Vacancy had contained magic. the Cormoran Strike series was more warmly received as a work of British detective fiction, even as some reviewers noted that the Cormoran Strike series's plots are occasionally contrived. Theatrical reviews of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child were highly positive. Fans have been more critical of the play's's use of time travel, changes to characters' personalities, and perceived queerbaiting in Harry and Scorpius's relationship, leading some to question the play's's connection to the Harry Potter canon.", "Gender and social division": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0]'s portrayal of women in Harry Potter has been described as complex and varied, but nonetheless conforming to stereotypical and patriarchal depictions of gender. Gender divides are ostensibly absent in the books: Hogwarts is coeducational and women hold positions of power in wizarding society. However, this setting obscures the typecasting of female characters and the general depiction of conventional gender roles. According to the scholars Elizabeth Heilman and Trevor Donaldson, the subordination of female characters goes further early in the books. The final three books \"showcase richer roles and more powerful females\": for instance, the books's \"most matriarchal character\", Molly Weasley, engages substantially in the final battle of Deathly Hallows, while other women are shown as leaders. Hermione Granger, in particular, becomes an active and independent character essential to the protagonists' battle against evil. Yet, even particularly capable female characters such as Hermione Granger and Minerva McGonagall are placed in supporting roles, and Hermione Granger's status as a feminist model is debated. Girls and women are frequently shown as emotional, defined by Girls and women's appearance, and denied agency in family settings.The social hierarchies in [0]'s magical world have been a matter of debate among scholars and critics. The primary antagonists of Harry Potter, Voldemort and his followers, believe blood purity is paramount, and that non-wizards, or \"muggles\", are subhuman. The primary antagonists of Harry Potter, Voldemort and his followers,'s ideology of racial difference is depicted as unambiguously evil. However, the books cannot wholly reject racial division, according to several scholars, as the books still depicts wizards as fundamentally superior to muggles. Blake and Zipes argue that numerous examples of wizardly superiority are depicted as \"natural and comfortable\". Thus, according to Gupta, Harry Potter depicts superior races as having a moral obligation of tolerance and altruism towards lesser races, rather than explicitly depicting equality.[0]'s depictions of the status of magical non-humans is similarly debated. Discussing the slavery of house-elves within Harry Potter, scholars such as Brycchan Carey have praised the books's abolitionist sentiments, viewing Hermione Granger's Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare as a model for younger readers' political engagement. Other critics, including Farah Mendlesohn, find the portrayal of house-elves extremely troublesome; house-elves are written as happy in house-elves's slavery, and Hermione Granger's efforts on house-elves's behalf are implied to be na\u00efve. Pharr terms house-elves a disharmonious element in the books, writing that [0] leaves house-elves's fate hanging; at the end of Deathly Hallows, house-elves remain enslaved and cheerful. More generally, the subordination of magical non-humans remains in place, unchanged by the defeat of Voldemort. Thus, scholars suggest, the series's message is essentially conservative; the series's message sees no reason to transform social hierarchies, only being concerned with who holds positions of power.", "Religious reactions": "J.K.Rowling is our person to focus on. There have been attempts to ban [0] around the world, especially in the United States, and in the Bible Belt in particular. [0] topped the American Library Association's list of most challenged books in the first three years of [0]'s publication. In the following years, parents in several US cities launched protests against teaching [0] in schools. Some Christian critics, particularly Evangelical Christians, have claimed that [0] promote witchcraft and harm children; similar opposition has been expressed to the film adaptations. Criticism has taken two main forms: allegations that [0] is a pagan text; and claims that [0] encourages children to oppose authority, derived mainly from Harry's's rejection of the Dursleys, Harry's's adoptive parents. The author and scholar Amanda Cockrell suggests that [0]'s popularity, and recent preoccupation with fantasy and the occult among Christian fundamentalists, explains why [0] received particular opposition. Some groups of Shia and Sunni Muslims also argued that [0] contained satanic subtext, and [0] was banned in private schools in the United Arab Emirates.[0] Harry's also have a group of vocal religious supporters who believe that [0] espouses Christian values, or that the Bible does not prohibit the forms of magic described in [0]. Christian analyses of [0] have argued that [0] embraces ideals of friendship, loyalty, courage, love, and the temptation of power. After the final volume was published, J.K.Rowling said J.K.Rowling intentionally incorporated Christian themes, in particular the idea that love may hold power over death. According to Farmer, it is a profound misreading to think that [0] promotes witchcraft. The scholar Em McAvan writes that evangelical objections to Harry Potter are superficial, based on the presence of magic in [0]: evangelical objections to Harry Potter do not attempt to understand the moral messages in [0]."}, "Legacy": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. Rowling's Harry Potter series has been credited with a resurgence in crossover fiction: children's literature with an adult appeal. Crossovers were prevalent in 19th-century American and British fiction, but fell out of favour in the 20th century and did not occur at the same scale. The post-Rowling's Harry Potter series crossover trend is associated with the fantasy genre. In the 1970s, children's books were generally realistic as opposed to fantastic, while adult fantasy became popular because of the influence of The Lord of the Rings. The next decade saw an increasing interest in grim, realist themes, with an outflow of fantasy readers and writers to adult works.The commercial success of Rowling's Harry Potter series in 1997 reversed this trend. The scale of Rowling's Harry Potter series's growth had no precedent in the children's market: within four years, Rowling's Harry Potter series occupied 28% of the children's market by revenue. Children's literature rose in cultural status, and fantasy became a dominant genre. Older works of children's fantasy, including Diana Wynne Jones's Chrestomanci series and Diane Duane's Young Wizards, were reprinted and rose in popularity; some authors re-established some authors's careers. In the following decades, many Rowling's Harry Potter series imitators and subversive responses grew popular.[0] has been compared with Enid Blyton, who also wrote in simple language about groups of children and long held sway over the British children's market. [0] has also been described as an heir to Roald Dahl. Some critics view Rowling's Harry Potter series's rise, along with the concurrent success of Philip Pullman's's His Dark Materials, as part of a broader shift in reading tastes: a rejection of literary fiction in favour of plot and adventure. a broader shift in reading tastes: a rejection of literary fiction in favour of plot and adventure is reflected in the BBC's 2003 \"Big Read\" survey of the UK's favourite books, where Philip Pullman's and [0] ranked at numbers\u00a03 and 5, respectively, with very few British literary classics in the top\u00a010.Harry Potter's popularity led Rowling's Harry Potter series's to plan elaborate releases and spawned a textual afterlife among fans and forgers. Beginning with the release of Prisoner of Azkaban on 8\u00a0July 1999 at 3:45\u00a0pm, Rowling's Harry Potter series's coordinated selling Rowling's Harry Potter series at the same time globally, introduced security protocols to prevent premature purchases, and required booksellers to agree not to sell copies before the appointed time. Driven by the growth of the internet, fan fiction about the series proliferated and has spawned a diverse community of readers and writers. While [0] has supported fan fiction, [0]'s statements about characters \u2013 for instance, that Harry and Hermione could have been a couple, and that Dumbledore was gay \u2013 have complicated [0]'s relationship with readers. According to scholars, complicated shows that modern readers feel a sense of ownership over the text that is independent of, and sometimes contradicts, authorial intent."}, "Legal disputes": {"": "J.K.Rowling is our person to focus on.
