{"summary": {"": "Sri Aurobindo is our person to focus on. [0] shall look out through Matter's gaze / And Matter shall reveal [0]'s face.Sri Aurobindo (born Aurobindo Ghose; 15 August 1872\u00a0\u2013 5 December 1950) was an Indian philosopher, yogi, maharishi, poet, and Indian nationalist. Sri Aurobindo was also a journalist, editing newspapers such as Vande Mataram. Sri Aurobindo joined the Indian movement for independence from British colonial rule, until 1910 was one of the Indian movement for independence from British colonial rule's influential leaders, and then became a spiritual reformer, introducing Sri Aurobindo's visions on human progress and spiritual evolution.Sri Aurobindo studied for the Indian Civil Service at King's College, in Cambridge, England. After returning to India Sri Aurobindo took up various civil service works under the Maharaja of the Princely state of Baroda and became increasingly involved in nationalist politics in the Indian National Congress and the nascent revolutionary movement in Bengal with the Anushilan Samiti. Sri Aurobindo was arrested in the aftermath of a number of bombings linked to the nascent revolutionary movement in Bengal with the Anushilan Samiti in a public trial where he faced charges of treason for Alipore Conspiracy. However, Sri Aurobindo could only be convicted and imprisoned for writing articles against British colonial rule in India. Sri Aurobindo was released when no evidence could be provided, following the murder of a prosecution witness, Narendranath Goswami, during a public trial where he faced charges of treason for Alipore Conspiracy. During Sri Aurobindo's stay in the jail, Sri Aurobindo had mystical and spiritual experiences, after which Sri Aurobindo moved to Pondicherry, leaving politics for spiritual work.At Pondicherry, Sri Aurobindo developed a spiritual practice Sri Aurobindo called Integral Yoga. The central theme of Sri Aurobindo's vision was the evolution of human life into a divine life in divine body. Sri Aurobindo believed in a spiritual realisation that not only liberated but transformed human nature, enabling a divine life on earth. In 1926, with the help of Sri Aurobindo's spiritual collaborator, Mirra Alfassa (referred to as \"The Mother\"), Sri Aurobindo Ashram was founded.Sri Aurobindo's main literary works are The Life Divine, which deals with the philosophical aspect of Integral Yoga; Synthesis of Yoga, which deals with the principles and methods of Integral Yoga; and Savitri: A Legend and a Symbol, an epic poem."}, "Biography": {"Early life": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was born in Calcutta (now Kolkata), Bengal Presidency, India on 15 August 1872 in a Bengali Kayastha family that was associated with the village of Konnagar in the Hooghly district of present-day West Bengal. His father, Krishna Dhun Ghose, was then assistant surgeon of Rangpur in Bengal and later civil surgeon of Khulna, and a former member of the Brahmo Samaj religious reform movement who had become enamoured with the then-new idea of evolution while pursuing medical studies in Edinburgh. His mother Swarnalata Devi's's father Shri Rajnarayan Bose was a leading figure in the Brahmo Samaj religious reform movement. His mother Swarnalata Devi's had been sent to the more salubrious surroundings of Calcutta (now Kolkata), Bengal Presidency, India for [0]'s . [0] had two elder siblings, Benoybhusan and Manmohan, a younger sister, Sarojini, and a younger brother, Barindra Kumar (also referred to as Barin).Young Aurobindo was brought up speaking English, but used Hindustani to communicate with servants. Although a Bengali Kayastha family that was associated with the village of Konnagar in the Hooghly district of present-day West Bengal were Bengali, His father, Krishna Dhun Ghose, believed British culture to be superior. He and his two elder siblings two elder siblings, Benoybhusan and Manmohan were sent to the English-speaking Loreto House boarding school in Darjeeling, in part to improve He and his two elder siblings's language skills and in part to distance He and his two elder siblings from He and his two elder siblings's His mother Swarnalata Devi's's . Darjeeling was a centre of Anglo-Indians in India and the English-speaking Loreto House boarding school in Darjeeling was run by Irish nuns, through which He and his two elder siblings would have been exposed to Christian religious teachings and symbolism.", "England (1879\u20131893)": "Sri Aurobindo is our person to focus on. [0] wanted [0]'s to enter the Indian Civil Service (ICS), an elite organisation comprising around 1000 people. To achieve enter it was necessary that his sons study in England and so it was there that the entire family moved in 1879. his sons were placed in the care of the Reverend W. H. Drewett in Manchester. the Reverend W. H. Drewett was a minister of the Congregational Church whom [0] knew through [0]'s British friends at Rangpur.his sons were taught Latin by the Reverend W. H. Drewett the Reverend W. H. Drewett's . taught was a prerequisite for admission to good English schools and, after two years, in 1881, the elder two siblings were enrolled at Manchester Grammar School. Sri Aurobindo was considered too young for enrollment, and Sri Aurobindo continued Sri Aurobindo's studies with Drewett and his wife, learning history, Latin, French, geography and arithmetic. Although Drewett and his wife were told not to teach religion, his sons inevitably were exposed to Christian teachings and events, which generally bored Sri Aurobindo and sometimes repulsed Sri Aurobindo. There was little contact with [0][0]'s , but what communication there was indicated that [0] was becoming less endeared to the British in India than [0] had been, on one occasion describing the British colonial government as \"heartless\".the Reverend W. H. Drewett emigrated to Australia in 1884, causing his sons to be uprooted as his sons went to live with the Reverend W. H. Drewett's in London. In September of 1884, Sri Aurobindo joined St Paul's School there. Sri Aurobindo learned Greek and spent the last three years reading literature and English poetry, while Sri Aurobindo also acquired some familiarity with the German and Italian languages; Peter Heehs resumes Sri Aurobindo's linguistic abilities by stating that at \"the turn of the century Sri Aurobindo knew at least twelve languages: English, French, and Bengali to speak, read, and write; Latin, Greek, and Sanskrit to read and write; Gujarati, Marathi, and Hindi to speak and read; and Italian, German, and Spanish to read.\" Being exposed to the evangelical structures of Drewett's mother developed in Sri Aurobindo a distaste for religion, and Sri Aurobindo considered Sri Aurobindo at one point to be an atheist but later determined that Sri Aurobindo was agnostic. A blue plaque unveiled in 2007 commemorates Sri Aurobindo's residence at 49 St Stephen's Avenue in Shepherd's Bush, London, from 1884 to 1887. his sons began living in spartan circumstances at the Liberal Club in South Kensington during 1887, [0] having experienced some financial difficulties. the Liberal Club in South Kensington's secretary was James Cotton, brother of their father's friend in the Bengal ICS, Henry Cotton.By 1889, Manmohan had determined to pursue a literary career and Benoybhusan had proved Benoybhusan unequal to the standards necessary for the Bengal ICS entrance. proved meant that Sri Aurobindo might fulfill [0]'s aspirations but to do so when [0] lacked money required that Sri Aurobindo studied hard for a scholarship. To become an the Bengal ICS official, students were required to pass the competitive examination, as well as to study at an English university for two years under probation. Sri Aurobindo secured a scholarship at King's College, Cambridge, under recommendation of Oscar Browning. Sri Aurobindo passed the written the Bengal ICS examination after a few months, being ranked 11th out of 250 competitors. Sri Aurobindo spent the next two years at King's College, Cambridge. Sri Aurobindo had no interest in the Bengal ICS and came late to the horse-riding practical exam purposefully to get Sri Aurobindo disqualified for the service.At this time, the Maharaja of Baroda, Sayajirao Gaekwad III, was travelling in England. James Cotton, brother of their father's friend in the Bengal ICS, Henry Cotton secured for Sri Aurobindo a place in the service and arranged for Sri Aurobindo to meet the Maharaja of Baroda, Sayajirao Gaekwad III,. Sri Aurobindo left England for India, arriving there in February 1893. In India, [0] [0]'s was misinformed by [0]'s agents from Bombay (now Mumbai) that the ship on which Sri Aurobindo had been travelling had sunk off the coast of Portugal.

In Baroda, [0] joined the state service in 1893, working first in the Survey and Settlements department, later moving to the Department of Revenue and then to the Secretariat, and much miscellaneous work like teaching grammar and assisting in writing speeches for the Maharaja of Gaekwad until 1897. In 1897 during [0]'s work in Baroda, [0] started working as a part-time French teacher at Baroda College (now Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda). [0] was later promoted to the post of vice-principal. At Baroda, [0] self-studied Sanskrit and Bengali.During [0]'s stay at Baroda, [0] had contributed to many articles to Indu Prakash and had spoken as a chairman of the Baroda college board. [0] started taking an active interest in the politics of the Indian independence movement against British colonial rule, working behind the scenes as [0]'s position in the state service barred [0] from an overt political activity. [0] linked up with resistance groups in Bengal and Madhya Pradesh, while travelling to Bengal and Madhya Pradesh. [0] established contact with Lokmanya Tilak and Sister Nivedita.[0] often travelled between Baroda and Bengali, at first in a bid to re-establish links with [0]'s parents' families and other Bengali relatives, including [0]'s sister Sarojini and brother Barin, and later increased to establish resistance groups across the Presidency. [0] formally moved to Calcutta in 1906 after the announcement of the Partition of Bengali. In 1901, on a visit to Calcutta, [0] married 14-year-old Mrinalini, the daughter of Bhupal Chandra Bose, a senior official in government service. [0] was 28 at that time. 14-year-old Mrinalini, the daughter of Bhupal Chandra Bose, a senior official in government service died seventeen years later in December 1918 during the influenza pandemic.In 1906, [0] was appointed the first principal of the National College in Calcutta, started to impart national education to Indian youth. [0] resigned from this position in August 1907, due to [0]'s increased political activity. the National College in Calcutta continues to the present as Jadavpur University, Kolkata.[0] was influenced by studies on rebellion and revolutions against England in medieval France and the revolts in America and Italy. In [0]'s public activities, [0] favored Non cooperation and Passive resistance; in private [0] took up secret revolutionary activity as a preparation for open revolt, in case that Passive resistance failed.In Bengali, with brother Barin's help, [0] established contacts and inspired revolutionaries such as Bagha Jatin or Jatin Mukherjee and Surendranath Tagore. [0] helped establish a series of youth clubs, including the Anushilan Samiti of Calcutta in [0] attended the 1906 Congress meeting headed by Dadabhai Naoroji and participated as a councilor in forming the fourfold objectives of \"Swaraj, Swadesh, Boycott, and national education\". In 1907 at the Surat session of Congress where moderates and extremists had a major showdown, [0] led along with extremists along with Bal Gangadhar Tilak. Congress split after the Surat session of Congress where moderates and extremists had a major showdown. In 1907\u20131908 [0] travelled extensively to Pune, Bombay and Baroda to firm up support for the nationalist cause, giving speeches and meeting with groups. [0] was arrested again in May 1908 in connection with the Alipore Bomb Case. [0] was acquitted in the ensuing trial, following the murder of chief prosecution witness Naren Goswami within jail premises, which subsequently led to the case against [0] collapsing. [0] was subsequently released after a year of isolated incarceration.Once out of the prison [0] started two new publications, Karmayogin in English and Dharma in Bengali. [0] also delivered the, Uttarpara Speech hinting at the transformation of [0]'s focus to spiritual matters. Repression from the British colonial government against [0] continued because of [0]'s writings in [0]'s new journals and in April 1910 [0] moved to Pondicherry, where the British colonial secret police monitored [0]'s activities.", "Conversion from politics to spirituality": "Sri Aurobindo is our person to focus on. In July 1905 then Viceroy of India, Lord Curzon, [0] Bengal. [0] sparked an outburst of public anger against the British, leading to civil unrest and a nationalist campaign by groups of revolutionaries that included Sri Aurobindo. In 1908, Khudiram Bose and Prafulla Chaki attempted to kill Magistrate Kingsford, a judge known for handing down particularly severe sentences against nationalists. However, the bomb thrown at his horse carriage Magistrate Kingsford, a judge known for handing down particularly severe sentences against nationalists's missed the bomb thrown at his horse carriage's target and instead landed in another carriage and killed two British women, the wife and daughter of barrister Pringle Kennedy. Sri Aurobindo was also arrested on charges of planning and overseeing attempted and imprisoned in solitary confinement in Alipore Jail. The trial of the Alipore Jail Bomb Case lasted for a year, but eventually, Sri Aurobindo was acquitted on 6 May 1909. Sri Aurobindo's defense counsel was Chittaranjan Das.During this period in Alipore Jail, Sri Aurobindo's view of life was radically changed due to spiritual experiences and realizations. Consequently, Sri Aurobindo's aim went far beyond the service and liberation of India. Sri Aurobindo said Sri Aurobindo was \"visited\" by Vivekananda in Alipore Jail: \"It is a fact that Sri Aurobindo was hearing constantly the voice of Vivekananda speaking to Sri Aurobindo for a fortnight in Alipore Jail in Sri Aurobindo's solitary meditation and felt Vivekananda's presence.\"In Sri Aurobindo's autobiographical notes, Sri Aurobindo said Sri Aurobindo felt a vast sense of calmness when Sri Aurobindo first came back to India. Sri Aurobindo could not explain felt and continued to have various such experiences from time to time. Sri Aurobindo knew nothing of yoga at that time and started Sri Aurobindo's practice of yoga without a teacher, except for some rules that Sri Aurobindo learned from Mr. Devadhar, a friend who was a disciple of Swami Brahmananda of Ganga Math, Chandod.   In 1907, Barin introduced Sri Aurobindo to Vishnu Bhaskar Lele, a Maharashtrian yogi. Sri Aurobindo was influenced by the guidance Sri Aurobindo got from Vishnu Bhaskar Lele, a Maharashtrian yogi.In 1910 Sri Aurobindo withdrew Sri Aurobindo from all political activities and went into hiding at Chandannagar in the house of Motilal Roy, while the British were attempting to prosecute Sri Aurobindo for sedition on the basis of a signed article titled 'To Sri Aurobindo's Countrymen', published in Karmayogin. As Sri Aurobindo disappeared from view, the warrant was held back and prosecute postponed. Sri Aurobindo manoeuvred the police into open action and a warrant was issued on 4 April 1910, but a warrant could not be executed because on 4 April 1910 Sri Aurobindo had reached Pondicherry, then a French colony. the warrant was withdrawn.", "Pondicherry (1910\u20131950)": "[0] is our person to focus on. In Pondicherry, [0] dedicated [0] to [0]'s spiritual and philosophical pursuits. In 1914, after four years of secluded yoga, [0] started a monthly philosophical magazine called Arya. a monthly philosophical magazine called Arya ceased publication in 1921. Many years later, [0] revised some of these works before some of these works were published in book form. Some of the book series derived out of a monthly philosophical magazine called Arya was The Life Divine, The Synthesis of Yoga, Essays on The Gita, The Secret of The Veda, Hymns to the Mystic Fire, The Upanishads, The Renaissance in India, War and Self-determination, The Human Cycle, The Ideal of Human Unity and The Future Poetry were published in a monthly philosophical magazine called Arya.At the beginning of [0]'s stay at Pondicherry, there were few followers, but with time their numbers grew, resulting in the formation of the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in 1926. From 1926 [0] started to sign [0] as Sri Aurobindo, Sri being commonly used as an honorific.For some time afterwards, [0]'s main literary output was his voluminous correspondence with his disciples. [0]'s letters, most of which were written in the 1930s, numbered in the several thousand. Many were brief comments made in the margins of his disciples's notebooks in answer to his disciples's questions and reports of his disciples's spiritual practice\u2014others extended to several pages of carefully composed explanations of practical aspects of [0]'s teachings. his voluminous correspondence with his disciples were later collected and published in book form in three volumes of Letters on Yoga. In the late 1930s, [0] resumed work on a poem he had started earlier\u2014[0] continued to expand and revise a poem he had started earlier for the rest of [0]'s life. a poem he had started earlier became perhaps [0]'s greatest literary achievement, Savitri, an epic spiritual poem in blank verse of approximately 24,000 lines.On 15 August 1947, [0] strongly opposed the partition of India, stating that [0] hoped \"India will not accept the settled fact as for ever settled, or as anything more than a temporary expedient.[0] was nominated twice for the Nobel prize without the Nobel prize being awarded, in 1943 for the Nobel prize and in 1950 for the Nobel award in Peace.[0] died on 5 December 1950, of uremia. Around 60,000 people attended to see [0]'s body resting peacefully. Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, and the President Rajendra Prasad praised [0] for [0]'s contribution to Yogic philosophy and the independence movement. National and international newspapers commemorated [0]'s .", "Mirra Alfassa (The Mother) and the development of the Ashram": "[0] is our person to focus on. Sri Aurobindo's close spiritual collaborator, Mirra Alfassa (born Alfassa), came to be known as The Mother. Sri Aurobindo's close spiritual collaborator, Mirra Alfassa (born Alfassa) was a French national, born in Paris on 21 February 1878. In Sri Aurobindo's close spiritual collaborator, Mirra Alfassa (born Alfassa)'s 20s Sri Aurobindo's close spiritual collaborator, Mirra Alfassa (born Alfassa) studied occultism with Max Theon.

[0]'s concept of the Integral Yoga system is described in [0]'s books, The Synthesis of Yoga and The Life Divine.  The Life Divine is a compilation of essays published serially in Arya.[0] argues that divine Brahman manifests as empirical reality through l\u012bl\u0101, or divine play. Instead of positing that the world we experience is an illusion (m\u0101y\u0101), [0] argues that world can evolve and become a new world with new species, far above the human species just as human species have evolved after the animal species. As such [0] argued that the end goal of spiritual practice could not merely be a liberation from the world into Samadhi but would also be that of descent of the Divine into the world in order to transform the world into a Divine existence. Thus, this constituted the purpose of the Integral Yoga system. Regarding the involution of consciousness in matter, [0] wrote that: \"This descent, this sacrifice of the Purusha, the Divine Soul submitting the Divine Soul to Force and Matter so that the Divine Soul may inform and illuminate Force and Matter is the seed of redemption of this world of Inconscience and Ignorance.[0] believed that Darwinism merely describes a phenomenon of the evolution of matter into life, but does not explain the reason behind a phenomenon of the evolution of matter into life, while [0] finds life to be already present in matter, because all of existence is a manifestation of Brahman. [0] argues that nature (which [0] interpreted as divine) has evolved life out of matter and the mind out of life. all of existence, [0] argues, is attempting to manifest to the level of the supermind \u2013 that evolution had a purpose. [0] stated that [0] found the task of understanding the nature of reality arduous and difficult to justify by immediate tangible results.", "Supermind": "[0] is our person to focus on. At the centre of [0]'s metaphysical system is the supermind, an intermediary power between the unmanifested Brahman and the manifested world. [0] claims that the supermind, an intermediary power between the unmanifested Brahman and the manifested world is not completely alien to us and can be realized within ourselves as the supermind, an intermediary power between the unmanifested Brahman and the manifested world is always present within mind since mind is in reality identical with the former and contains the former as a potentiality within mind. [0] does not portray the supermind, an intermediary power between the unmanifested Brahman and the manifested world as an original invention of [0]'s own but believes the supermind, an intermediary power between the unmanifested Brahman and the manifested world can be found in the Vedas and that the Vedic Gods represent powers of the supermind, an intermediary power between the unmanifested Brahman and the manifested world. In The Integral Yoga [0] declares that \"By the supermind, an intermediary power between the unmanifested Brahman and the manifested world is meant the full Truth-Consciousness of the Divine Nature in which there can be no place for the principle of division and ignorance; the supermind, an intermediary power between the unmanifested Brahman and the manifested world is always a full light and knowledge superior to all mental substance or mental movement.\" the supermind, an intermediary power between the unmanifested Brahman and the manifested world is a bridge between Sachchidananda and the lower manifestation and it is only through the supramental that mind, life and body can be spiritually transformed as opposed to through Sachchidananda The descent of the supermind, an intermediary power between the unmanifested Brahman and the manifested world will mean the creation of a supramental race", "Affinity with Western philosophy": "[0] is our person to focus on. In [0]'s writings, talks, and letters [0] has referred to several European philosophers with whose basic concepts he was familiar, commenting on several European philosophers with whose basic concepts he was familiar's ideas and discussing the question of affinity to [0]'s own line of thought. Thus, [0] wrote a long essay on the Greek philosopher Heraclitus and mentioned especially Plato, Plotinus, Nietzsche and Bergson as thinkers in whom [0] was interested because of Plato, Plotinus, Nietzsche and Bergson's more intuitive approach. On the other hand, [0] felt little attraction for the philosophy of Kant or Hegel. Several studies have shown a remarkable closeness to the evolutionary thought of Teilhard de Chardin, whom he did not know, whereas Teilhard de Chardin, whom he did not know came to know of [0] at a late stage. After reading some chapters of The Life Divine, Teilhard de Chardin, whom he did not know is reported to have said that [0]'s vision of evolution was basically the same as Teilhard de Chardin, whom he did not know, though stated for Asian readers.Several scholars have discovered significant similarities in the thought of Sri Aurobindo and Hegel. Steve Odin has discussed the thought of Sri Aurobindo and Hegel comprehensively in a comparative study. Steve Odin writes that [0] \"has appropriated Hegel\u2019s notion of an Absolute Spirit and employed Hegel\u2019s notion of an Absolute Spirit to radically restructure the architectonic framework of the ancient Hindu Vedanta system in contemporary terms.\" In Steve Odin's analysis Steve Odin arrives at the conclusion that \"Sri Aurobindo and Hegel similarly envision world creation as the progressive self-manifestation and evolutionary ascent of a universal consciousness in a universal consciousness's journey toward Self-realization.\" Steve Odin points out that in contrast to the deterministic and continuous dialectal unfolding of Absolute Reason by the mechanism of thesis-antithesis-synthesis or affirmation-negation-integration, \"[0] argues for a creative, emergent mode of evolution.\" In Steve Odin's r\u00e9sum\u00e9 Steve Odin states that [0] has overcome the ahistorical world-vision of traditional Hinduism and presented a concept which allows for a genuine advance and novelty.", "Importance of the Upanishads": "[0] is our person to focus on. Although [0] was familiar with the most important lines of thought in Western philosophy, [0] did not acknowledge the most important lines of thought in Western philosophy's influence on [0]'s own writings. [0] wrote that his philosophy \"was formed first by the study of the Upanishads and the Gita\u2026 the Upanishads and the Gita were the basis of [0]'s first practice of Yoga.\" With the help of [0]'s readings [0] tried to move on to actual experience, \"and it was on actual experience that later on [0] founded his philosophy, not on ideas themselvesideas themselves.\"He assumes that the seers of the Upanishads had basically the same approach and gives some details of [0]'s vision of the past in a long passage in The Renaissance of India. \"the Upanishads have been the acknowledged source of numerous profound philosophies and religions,\" [0] writes. Even Buddhism with all its developments Even Buddhism with all its developments's was only a \"restatement\" from a new standpoint and with fresh terms. And, furthermore, the ideas of the Upanishads \"can be rediscovered in much of the thought of Pythagoras and Plato and form the profound part of Neo-platonism and Gnosticism...\" Finally, the larger part of German metaphysics \"is little more in substance than an intellectual development of great realities more spiritually seen in this ancient teaching.\" When once [0] was asked by a disciple whether Plato got some of Plato's ideas from Indian books, [0] responded that though something of the philosophy of India got through \"by means of Pythagoras and others\", [0] assumed that Plato got most of Plato's ideas from intuition.[0]'s indebtedness to the Indian tradition also becomes obvious through [0]'s placing a large number of quotations from the Rig Veda, the Upanishads and the Bhagavadgita at the beginning of the chapters in The Life Divine, showing the connection of [0]'s own thought to Veda and Vedanta.The Isha Upanishad is considered to be one of the most important and more accessible writings of [0]. Before [0] published [0]'s final translation and analysis, [0] wrote ten incomplete commentaries. In a key passage [0] points out that the Brahman or Absolute is both the Stable and the Moving. \"We must see the Brahman or Absolute in eternal and immutable Spirit and in all the changing manifestations of universe and relativity.\" [0]'s biographer K.R.S. Iyengar quotes R.S. Mugali as stating that [0] might have obtained in The Isha Upanishad the thought-seed which later grew into The Life Divine.", "Synthesis and integration": "[0] is our person to focus on. Sisir Kumar Maitra, who was a leading exponent of Sri Aurobindo's Philosophy, has referred to the issue of external influences and written that [0] does not mention names, but \"as one reads [0]'s books one cannot fail to notice how thorough is [0]'s grasp of the great Western philosophers of the present age...\" Although [0] is Indian one should not \"underrate the influence of Western thought upon [0]. the influence of Western thought is there, very clearly visible, but [0]... has not allowed [0] to be dominated by the influence of Western thought. [0] has made full use of Western thought, but [0] has made use of Western thought for the purpose of building up [0]'s own system...\" Thus Sisir Kumar Maitra, who was a leading exponent of Sri Aurobindo's Philosophy, like Steve Odin, sees [0] not only in the tradition and context of Indian, but also Western philosophy and assumes [0] may have adopted some elements from Western philosophy for [0]'s synthesis.R. Puligandla supports this viewpoint in R. Puligandla's book Fundamentals of Indian Philosophy. R. Puligandla describes Sri Aurobindo's Philosophy as \"an original synthesis of the Indian and Western traditions.\" \"[0] integrates in a unique fashion the great social, political and scientific achievements of the modern West with the ancient and profound spiritual insights of Hinduism. The vision that powers the life divine of [0] is none other than the Upanishadic vision of the unity of all existence.R. Puligandla also discusses [0]'s critical position vis-\u00e0-vis Shankara and [0]'s thesis that the latter's Vedanta is a world-negating philosophy, as the latter's Vedanta teaches that the world is unreal and illusory. From R. Puligandla's standpoint this is a misrepresentation of Shankara's position, which may have been caused by [0]'s endeavour to synthesize Hinduism and Western modes of thought, identifying Shankara's Mayavada with the subjective idealism of George Berkeley.However, [0]'s critique of Shankara is supported by U. C. Dubey in U. C. Dubey's paper titled Integralism: The Distinctive Feature of Sri Aurobindo's Philosophy. U. C. Dubey points out that Sri Aurobindo's Philosophy presents an integral view of Reality where there is no opposition between the Absolute and its creative force, as the Absolute and its creative force are actually one. Furthermore, U. C. Dubey refers to Sri Aurobindo's conception of the supermind as the mediatory principle between the Absolute and the finite world and quotes S.K. Maitra stating that Sri Aurobindo's conception of the supermind as the mediatory principle between the Absolute and the finite world \"is the pivot round which the whole of Sri Aurobindo's Philosophy moves.U. C. Dubey proceeds to analyse the approach of the Shankarites and believes that the Shankarites follow an inadequate kind of logic that does not do justice to the challenge of tackling the problem of the Absolute, which cannot be known by finite reason. With the help of the finite reason, U. C. Dubey says, \"we are bound to determine the nature of reality as one or many, being or becoming. But [0]'s Integral Advaitism reconciles all apparently different aspects of Existence in an all-embracing unity of the Absolute.\" Next, U. C. Dubey explains that for [0] there is a higher reason, the \"logic of the infinite\" in which [0]'s integralism is rooted.", "": ""}, "Legacy": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on.

In India, S. K. Maitra, Anilbaran Roy and D. P. Chattopadhyaya commented on [0]'s work. Writers on esotericism and traditional wisdom, such as Mircea Eliade, Paul Brunton, and Rene Guenon, all saw [0] as an authentic representative of the Indian spiritual tradition. Though Rene Guenon thought [0]'s thoughts were betrayed by some of [0]'s followers and that some works published under [0]'s name were not authentic, since not traditional.Haridas Chaudhuri and Frederic Spiegelberg were among those who were inspired by [0], who worked on the newly formed American Academy of Asian Studies in San Francisco. Soon after, Haridas Chaudhuri and Haridas Chaudhuri's wife Bina established the Cultural Integration Fellowship, from which later emerged the California Institute of Integral Studies.[0] influenced Subhash Chandra Bose to take an initiative of dedicating to Indian National Movement full-time.
