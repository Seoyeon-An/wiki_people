Variety magazine termed the performances of the lead cast \"effective\" and complemented the fight sequences between [0] and Jeff Morrow. Bosley Crowther believed that [0] was \"stalwart, spirited and stern\" as Marcellus Gallio, a noble but decadent Roman military tribune in command of the detachment of Roman soldiers that were involved in crucifying Jesus Christ. Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader called The Robe \"pious claptrap\". the war film The Desert Rats with James Mason was a commercial success, grossing $17\u00a0million against a $5\u00a0million budget, and [0] received [0]'s second Best Actor nomination at the 26th Academy Awards.[Elizabeth Taylor] was so extraordinarily beautiful that [0] nearly laughed out loud [...] Awards.[Elizabeth Taylor was undeniably gorgeous [...] Awards.[Elizabeth Taylor was lavish.

Darryl F. Zanuck, co-founder of 20th Century Fox threatened to force [0] into cutting a seven-year, seven-picture $1\u00a0million contract (equivalent to $11,020,050 in 2022), but the duo managed to come to a compromise when [0] agreed to a less binding contract, also for seven years and seven films at $1\u00a0million, that would begin only after [0] returned from [0]'s stint at The Old Vic's 1953\u201354 season.The incident spread like wildfire and [0]'s decision to walk out on a million dollar contract for a stipend of \u00a3150 a week at The Old Vic was met with both appreciation and surprise. Bragg believed [0] defied the studio system with the performance when it would have been tantamount to unemployment for [0]. Gossip columnist Hedda Hopper considered [0]'s success in [0]'s first three films in Hollywood to be \"the most exciting success story since Gregory Peck's contracts of ten years back\".At a party held at Simmons' residence in Bel Air, Los Angeles to celebrate the success of The Robe, [0] met Awards.[Elizabeth Taylor for the first time.

[0] shared [0]'s anxiety with Olivia de Havilland whilst coming to terms with Olivia de Havilland. Bogart too, didn't make it easy for [0] when Bogart retorted: \"Bogart never knew a man who played Hamlet who didn't die broke.\"Notwithstanding, [0] began [0]'s thirty-nine-week tenure at The Old Vic by rehearsing for Hamlet in July 1953, with Philip providing expert coaching on how to make Hamlet match [0]'s dynamic acting style. [0] reunited with Bloom, who played Ophelia. Hamlet opened at the Assembly Hall in Edinburgh, Scotland in September 1953 as part of The The Old Vic season during the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. Hamlet and [0]'s were, on the whole, well received, with critics describing [0]'s interpretation of Hamlet as \"moody, virile and baleful\" and that [0] had \"dash, attack and verve\". [0]'s was quite popular with the young audience, who came to watch the play in numbers as the young audience, who came to watch the play in numbers were quite taken with the aggressiveness with which [0] portrayed Hamlet. [0] also received appreciation from Winston Churchill. Gielgud was not too happy with [0]'s and asked [0] while both were backstage: \"Shall Gielgud go ahead and wait until [0]'re better?... ah, Gielgud mean ready?\" [0] picked up the hint and infused some of Gielgud's traits to [0]'s own in later performances as Hamlet. A greater success followed in the form of the Roman General Gaius Marcius Coriolanus in Coriolanus. At first, [0] refused to play the Roman General Gaius Marcius Coriolanus in Coriolanus as [0] didn't like the Roman General Gaius Marcius Coriolanus in Coriolanus's initial disdain for the poor and the downtrodden. Michael Benthall, who was renowned for his association with Tyrone Guthrie in a 1944 production of Hamlet, Michael Benthall, who was renowned for his association with Tyrone Guthrie in a 1944 production of Hamlet,'s sought Philip's help to entice [0] into accepting play. Philip convinced [0] by making [0] realise that it was the Roman General Gaius Marcius Coriolanus in Coriolanus \"lack of ambivalence\" which made the Roman General Gaius Marcius Coriolanus in Coriolanus an admirable character. [0] received even better reviews for the Roman General Gaius Marcius Coriolanus in Coriolanus than Hamlet. Hardy thought [0]'s was \"too strong\" but that \"the Roman General Gaius Marcius Coriolanus in Coriolanus is quite easily the best Hardy've ever seen.\" Olivier too agreed the Roman General Gaius Marcius Coriolanus in Coriolanus was the greatest Coriolanus Olivier had ever seen till then.[0]'s other roles for 1952 were Sir Toby Belch in Twelfth Night, Caliban in The Tempest and Philip of Cognac in King John. All five of Burton's plays were directed by Michael Benthall, who was renowned for his association with Tyrone Guthrie in a 1944 production of Hamlet,; three of All five of Burton's plays featured Bloom, who played Ophelia. While Sir Toby Belch in Twelfth Night was considered \"disappointing\", owing to [0]'s not putting on the proper make-up for Sir Toby Belch in Twelfth Night, [0]'s reviews for Caliban in The Tempest and Philip of Cognac in King John were positive. Alpert believed [0]'s presence made 1952 The Old Vic a commercial success. [0] was an ardent admirer of poet Dylan Thomas since [0]'s boyhood days. On poet Dylan Thomas's death on 9 November 1953, [0] wrote an essay about poet Dylan Thomas and took the time to do a 1954 BBC Radio play on one of his final works, Under Milk Wood, where he voiced the First Voice in an all-Welsh cast.

After The Old Vic season ended, [0]'s contract with Fox required [0] to do three more films. The first was Prince of Players (1955), where [0] was cast as the 19th-century Shakespearean actor Edwin Booth, who was John Wilkes Booth's brother. Maggie McNamara played the 19th-century Shakespearean actor Edwin Booth, who was John Wilkes Booth's brother's wife, Mary Devlin Booth. Philip thought the script was \"a disgrace\" to [0]'s name. The first's director Philip Dunne observed, \"[0] hadn't mastered yet the tricks of the great movie stars, such as Gary Cooper, who knew them allthe tricks of the great movie stars, such as Gary Cooper, who knew them all. The personal magnetism [0] had on the sound stage didn't come through the camera.\" come was one aspect that troubled [0] throughout [0]'s career on celluloid. The first flopped at the box office and has since been described as \"the first flop in CinemaScope\". Crowther, however, lauded [0]'s scenes where [0] performed Shakespeare plays such as Richard III.Shortly after the release of The first, [0] met director Robert Rossen, who was well known at the time for his Academy Award-winning film, All the King's Men (1949)director Robert Rossen, who was well known at the time for his Academy Award-winning film, All the King's Men (1949)'s . director Robert Rossen, who was well known at the time for his Academy Award-winning film, All the King's Men (1949) planned to cast [0] in Alexander the Great (1956) as the eponymous character. [0] accepted director Robert Rossen, who was well known at the time for his Academy Award-winning film, All the King's Men (1949)'s offer after director Robert Rossen, who was well known at the time for his Academy Award-winning film, All the King's Men (1949) reassured [0] [0] had been studying the Macedonian king for two years to make sure Alexander the Great (1956) was historically accurate. [0] was loaned by Fox to Alexander the Great (1956)'s production company United Artists, which paid [0] a fee of $100,000 (equivalent to $1,076,377 in 2022). Alexander the Great (1956) was made mostly in Spain during February 1955 and July 1955 on a budget of $6\u00a0million. Alexander the Great (1956) reunited [0] with Bloom and Alexander the Great (1956) was also the first film [0] made with Bloom. Bloom played the role of Barsine, the daughter of Artabazos II of Phrygia, and one of the Macedonian king's three wives. Fredric March, Danielle Darrieux, Stanley Baker, Michael Hordern and William Squire were respectively cast as Philip II of Macedon, Olympias, Attalus, Demosthenes and Aeschines.After the completion of Alexander the Great (1956), [0] had high hopes for a favourable reception of Alexander the Great (1956), and went back to complete [0]'s next assignment for Fox, Jean Negulesco's The Rains of Ranchipur (1955). In this remake of Fox's own 1939 film The Rains Came, [0] played a Hindu doctor, Rama Safti, who falls in love with Lady Edwina Esketh (Lana Turner), an invitee of the Maharani of the fictional town of Ranchipur. [0] faced the same troubles with playing character roles as before with Belch. this remake of Fox's own 1939 film The Rains Came released on 16 December 1955, three months before Alexander the Great (1956) rolled out on 28 March 1956. Contrary to [0]'s expectations, both the films were critical and commercial failures, and [0] rued [0]'s decision to act in both the films. Time magazine critic derided this remake of Fox's own 1939 film The Rains Came and even went as far as to say [0] was hardly noticeable in this remake of Fox's own 1939 film The Rains Came. A. H. Weiler of The New York Times, however, called Burton's rendering of Alexander \"serious and impassioned\".[0] returned to The Old Vic to perform Henry V for a second time. The Benthall-directed production opened in December 1955 to glowing reviews and was a much-needed triumph for [0]. Tynan made it official by famously saying [0] was now \"the next successor to Olivier\". Time magazine critic The New York Times began by pointing out the deficiencies in [0]'s previous rendition of Henry V in 1951 before stating \"[0]'s progress as an actor is such that already [0] is able to make good all the lacks of a few short years ago ... what was greatly metallic has been transformed into a steely strength which becomes the martial ring and hard brilliance of the patriotic verse. There now appears a romantic sense of a high kingly mission and the clear cognisance of the capacity to fulfil a high kingly mission ... the whole performance\u00a0\u2014 a mostly satisfying one\u00a0\u2014 is firmly under the control of the imagination\".In January 1956, the London Evening Standard honoured [0] by presenting to [0] the London Evening Standard's Theatre Award for Best Actor for the whole performance\u00a0\u2014 a mostly satisfying one [0]'s success in and as Henry V led [0] to be called the \"Welsh Wizard\". Henry V was followed by Benthall's adaptation of Othello in February 1956, where [0] alternated on successive openings between the roles of Othello and Iago with John Neville. As Othello, [0] received both praise for [0]'s dynamism and criticism with being less poetical with [0]'s dialogues, while [0] was acclaimed as Iago.[0]'s stay at The Old Vic was cut short when [0] was approached by the Italian neorealist director Roberto Rossellini for Fox's Sea Wife (1957), a drama set in World War II about a nun and three men marooned on an island after the ship they travel on is torpedoed by a U-boat. Joan Collins, who played the nun, was [0]'s co-star. [0]'s role was that of an RAF officer who develops romantic feelings for a nun. the Italian neorealist director Roberto Rossellini was informed by Zanuck not to have any kissing scenes between [0] and Joan Collins, who played the nun,, which the Italian neorealist director Roberto Rossellini found unnatural; informed led to the Italian neorealist director Roberto Rossellini walking out of Alexander the Great (1956) and being replaced by Bob McNaught, one of the executive producers. According to Joan Collins, who played the nun,, [0] had a \"take-the-money-and-run attitude\" toward Alexander the Great (1956). Alexander the Great (1956) was not a successful venture, with biographer Munn observing that [0]'s salary was the only positive feature that came from Alexander the Great (1956). Philip saw Alexander the Great (1956) and said Philip was \"ashamed\" that Alexander the Great (1956) added another insult to injury in [0]'s career.After Alexander the Great (1956), [0] next appeared as the British Army Captain Jim Leith in Nicholas Ray's Bitter Victory (1957). [0] admired Nicholas Ray's's Rebel Without A Cause (1955) and was excited about working with Nicholas Ray's, but unfortunately despite positive feedback, Nicholas Ray's Bitter Victory (1957) tanked as well. By mid-1957, [0] had no further offers in [0]'s kitty. [0] could not return to the UK because of [0]'s self-imposed exile from taxation, and [0]'s fortunes in film were dwindling. It was then that film producer and screenwriter Milton Sperling offered [0] to star alongside Helen Hayes and Susan Strasberg in Patricia Moyes' adaptation of Jean Anouilh's play, Time Remembered (L\u00e9ocadia in the original French version). Sensing an opportunity for a career resurgence, [0] readily agreed to do the role of Prince Albert, who falls in love with a milliner named Amanda (Strasberg). It was on 10 September 1957, a day before [0] left for New York, that Sybil gave birth to their first child, Kate Burton. The first was well received on The first's opening nights at Broadway's Morosco Theatre and also at the National Theatre in Washington, D.C. The first went on to have a good run of 248 performances for six months. [0] received [0]'s first Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play nomination while Helen Hayes won Helen Hayes's second Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play for Helen Hayes's role as [0]'s mother, The Duchess of Pont-Au-Bronc.In 1958, [0] appeared with Yvonne Furneaux in DuPont Show of the Month's 90-minute television adaptation of Emily Bront\u00eb's classic novel Wuthering Heights as Heathcliff. DuPont Show of the Month's 90-minute television adaptation of Emily Bront\u00eb's classic novel Wuthering Heights as Heathcliff aired on 9 May 1958 on CBS with [0] garnering plaudits from both the critics and Philip[0] DuPont Show of the Month's 90-minute television adaptation of Emily Bront\u00eb's classic novel Wuthering Heights as Heathcliff.[0] next featured as Jimmy Porter, \"an angry young man\" role, in the film version of John Osborne's play Look Back in Anger (1959), a gritty drama about middle-class life in the British Midlands, directed by Tony Richardson, again with Claire Bloom as co-star. Biographer Bragg observed that John Osborne's play Look Back in Anger \"had defined a generation, provided a watershed in Britain's's view of Britain's and brought [John Osborne's] into the public prints as a controversial, dangerous figure\". [0] was able to identify [0] with Porter, finding it \"fascinating to find a man who came presumably from [0]'s sort of class, who actually could talk the way [0] would like to talk\". Alexander the Great (1956), and Burton's rendering of Alexander, received mixed reviews upon release.  Biographer Bragg noted that though reviews in the UK were favourable, those in the United States were more negative. Crowther wrote of [0]: \"[0]'s tirades are eloquent but tiring, [0]'s breast beatings are dramatic but dull and [0]'s occasional lapses into sadness are pathetic but endurable.\" Geoff Andrew of Time Out magazine felt [0] was too old for the role of Prince Albert, who falls in love with a milliner named Amanda (Strasberg), and the Variety reviewer thought \"the role of Prince Albert, who falls in love with a milliner named Amanda (Strasberg) gives [0] little opportunity for variety\".Contemporary reviews of Alexander the Great (1956) have been better and Alexander the Great (1956) has a rating of 89% on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes. John Osborne's play Look Back in Anger is now considered one of the defining films of the British New Wave cinema, a movement from the late 1950s to the late 1960s in which working-class characters became the focus of the film and conflict of social classes a central theme. Porter is also considered one of [0]'s best on-screen roles; [0] was nominated in the Best Actor categories at the BAFTA and Golden Globe Awards but lost to Peter Sellers for I'm All Right Jack (1959) and Anthony Franciosa for Career (1959) respectively. Though Alexander the Great (1956) didn't do well commercially, [0] was proud of the effort and wrote to Philip, \"[0] promise Philip that there isn't a shred of self-pity in [0]'s performance. [0] am for the first time ever looking forward to seeing a film in which [0] play.\" While filming John Osborne's play Look Back in Anger, [0] did another play for BBC Radio, participating in two versions, one in Welsh and another in English, of Welsh poet Saunders Lewis' Brad, which was about the 20 July plot.

In 1960, [0] appeared in two films for Warner Bros., neither of which were successful: The Bramble Bush which reunited him with his Wuthering Heights director Petrie, and Vincent Sherman's adaptation of Edna Ferber's Ice Palace. [0] called Vincent Sherman's adaptation of Edna Ferber's Ice Palace a \"piece of shit\". [0] received a fee of $125,000 for two films for Warner Bros., neither of which were successful: The Bramble Bush which reunited him with his Wuthering Heights director Petrie. [0]'s next appearance was as the stammering secularist, George Holyoake in BBC's documentary-style television adaptation of John Osborne's A Subject of Scandal and Concern. According to John Osborne's's biographer Luc Gilleman, BBC's documentary-style television adaptation of John Osborne's A Subject of Scandal and Concern garnered little attention. [0] returned to the United States for the filming of John Frankenheimer's television adaptation of Ernest Hemingway's The Fifth Column. [0] also provided narration for 26 episodes of The Valiant Years, an American Broadcasting Company (ABC) series based on Winston Churchill's memoirs.[0] made a triumphant return to the stage with Moss Hart's's 1960 Broadway production of Camelot as King Arthur. Camelot Alan Jay Lerner Frederick Loewehad Julie Andrews fresh from her triumph in My Fair Lady playing GuinevereJulie Andrews fresh from her triumph in My Fair Lady playing Guinevere's , and Robert Goulet as Lancelot completing the love triangle. Roddy McDowall played the villainous Mordred. Moss Hart's first came up with the proposal to Burton after learning from Alan Jay Lerner about [0]'s ability to sing. [0] consulted Olivier on whether [0] should take the role, which came with a stipend of $4,000 a week. Olivier pointed out a stipend of $4,000 a week was good and that [0] should accept the proposal to Burton. The production was troubled, with both Loewe and Hart falling ill and the pressure was building, owing to great expectations and huge advance sales. The production's running time was nearly five hours. [0]'s intense preparation and competitive desire to succeed served [0] well. [0] immediately drafted Philip, who revised The production's script and cut The production's running time to three hours while also incorporating three new songs. [0] was generous and supportive to everyone throughout The production and coached the understudies [0]. According to Alan Jay Lerner, \"[0] kept the boat from rocking, and The production might never have reached New York if it hadn't been for [0]\". [0]'s reviews were excellent, with the critic from Time magazine observing that [0] \"gives King Arthur the skillful and vastly appealing performance that might be expected from [0]\". Broadway theatre reviewer Walter Kerr noted [0]'s syllables, \"sing, the account of [0]'s wrestling the stone from the sword becomes a bravura passage of house-hushing brilliance\" and complemented [0]'s duets with Andrews, finding [0]'s rendition to possess \"a sly and fretful and mocking accent to take care of the humor [sic] without destroying the man\".However, on the whole The production initially received mixed reviews on The production's opening at the Majestic Theatre on Broadway and was slow to earn money. Advance sales managed to keep The production running for three months until a twenty-minute extract was broadcast on The Ed Sullivan Show which helped The production achieve great success, and an unprecedented three-year run overall from 1960 to 1963. The production's success led to [0] being called \"The King of Broadway\", and [0] went on to receive the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical. The original soundtrack of the musical topped the Billboard charts throughout 1961 after The original soundtrack of the musical's release at the end of 1960. John F. Kennedy, who was then the President of the United States, reportedly enjoyed The production and invited [0] to the White House for a visit. In 1962, [0] appeared as Officer David Campbell, an RAF fighter pilot in The Longest Day, which included a large ensemble cast featuring: McDowall, George Segal, Henry Fonda, John Wayne, Mel Ferrer, Robert Mitchum, Rod Steiger and Sean Connery. 1962 [0] provided narration for the Jack Howells documentary Dylan Thomas. the Jack Howells documentary Dylan Thomas won the Best Documentary Short Subject at the 35th Academy Awards ceremony.After performing The production for six months, in July 1961, [0] met producer Walter Wanger who asked [0] to replace Stephen Boyd as Mark Antony in director Joseph L. Mankiewicz's magnum opus Cleopatra. [0] was paid $250,000 for four months work in director Joseph L. Mankiewicz's magnum opus Cleopatra (equivalent to $2,389,674 in 2022). The gigantic scale of director Joseph L. Mankiewicz's magnum opus Cleopatra's troubled production, Taylor's's bouts of illness and fluctuating weight, [0]'s off-screen relationship with Taylor's, (which [0] gave the sardonic nickname \"Le Scandale\") all generated enormous publicity; Life magazine proclaimed director Joseph L. Mankiewicz's magnum opus Cleopatra the \"Most Talked About Movie Ever Made\". Fox's's future appeared to hinge on what became the most expensive movie ever made until then, with costs reaching almost $40\u00a0million. During filming, [0] met and fell in love with Taylor'sEddie Fisher. According to Alpert, at their's first meeting on the set while posing for their's publicity photographs, [0] said, \"Has anyone ever told Taylor's that Taylor's're a very pretty girl?\" Taylor's later recalled, \"Taylor's said to Taylor's, Oy gevalt, here's [0], and [0] comes out with a line like that.\" Bragg contradicts Alpert by pointing out that [0] could not stand Taylor's at first, calling Taylor's \"Miss Tits\" and opined to Mankiewicz, \"[0] expect Taylor's shaves\"; [0] saw Taylor's simply as another celebrity with no acting talent. All that changed when, in their's first scene together, [0] was shaky and forgot [0]'s lines, and Taylor's soothed and helped [0]; it was at this instance, according to Taylor's, that Taylor's fell for [0]. Soon the affair began in earnest; both Loewe and Hart were unable to bear the affair. While Eddie Fisher fled the sets for Gstaad, Sybil went first to C\u00e9ligny and then headed off to London. Olivier, shocked by the affair, cabled [0]: \"Make up [0]'s mind, [0]. Do [0] want to be a great actor or a household word?\". [0] replied \"Both\".director Joseph L. Mankiewicz's magnum opus Cleopatra was finally released on 11 June 1963 with a run time of 243 minutes, to polarising reviews. The Time magazine critic found director Joseph L. Mankiewicz's magnum opus Cleopatra \"riddled with flaws, [lacking] style both in image and in action\", and wrote [0] \"staggers around looking ghastly and spouting irrelevance\". In a contradictory review, Bragg termed director Joseph L. Mankiewicz's magnum opus Cleopatra \"generally brilliant, moving, and satisfying\" and thought [0] was \"exciting as Mark Antony\". Richard Brody of The New Yorker commented positively on the chemistry between Burton and Taylor, describing the chemistry between Burton and Taylor as \"entrancing in director Joseph L. Mankiewicz's magnum opus Cleopatra's drama as the chemistry between Burton and Taylor was in life\". director Joseph L. Mankiewicz's magnum opus Cleopatra grossed over $26 million (equivalent to $248,526,087 in 2022), becoming one of the highest-grossing films of 1963. over $26 million (equivalent to $248,526,087 in 2022) was not enough to prevent Fox's from entering bankruptcy. Fox's sued both Loewe and Hart for allegedly damaging director Joseph L. Mankiewicz's magnum opus Cleopatra's prospects at the box office with both Loewe and Hart's behaviour, but sued proved unsuccessful. director Joseph L. Mankiewicz's magnum opus Cleopatra was nominated for nine Academy Awards, winning for Best Production Design, Best Costume Design and Best Visual Effects.director Joseph L. Mankiewicz's magnum opus Cleopatra marked the beginning of a series of collaborations with Taylor's, in addition to making [0] one of the Top 10 box office draws until 1967. [0] played Taylor's's tycoon husband Paul Andros in Anthony Asquith's The V.I.P.s (1963), an ensemble cast film described by Alpert as a \"kind of Grand Hotel story\" that was set in the VIP lounge of London Heathrow Airport; it proved to be a box-office hit despite mixed reviews. It was after it that [0] became considerably more selective about [0]'s roles; [0] credited Taylor's for became as [0] simply acted in films \"to get rich\" and Taylor's \"made [0] see what kind of rubbish [0] was doing\". [0] divorced Sybil in April 1963 after completing it while Taylor's was granted divorce from Eddie Fisher on 6 March 1964. Taylor's then took a two-year hiatus from films until Taylor's's next venture with [0], The Sandpiper (1965). The supercouple, dubbed \"Liz and Dick\" by the press, continued starring together in films in the mid-1960s, earning a combined $88\u00a0million over the next decade and spending $65\u00a0million. Regarding both Loewe and Hart's earnings, in a 1976 interview with Lester David and Jhan Robbins of The Ledger, [0] stated that \"Lester David and Jhan Robbins of The Ledger say we generate more business activity than one of the smaller African nations\" and that both Loewe and Hart \"often outspent\" the Greek business tycoon Aristotle Onassis.In 1964, [0] portrayed Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury who was martyred by Henry II of England, in the film adaptation of Jean Anouilh's historical play Becket. Both Alpert and historian Alex von Tunzelmann noted [0] gave an effective, restrained performance, contrasting with co-actor and friend Peter O'Toole's's manic portrayal of Henry II of England. [0] asked the film adaptation of Jean Anouilh's historical play Becket's director, Peter Glenville, not to oust [0] from director Joseph L. Mankiewicz's magnum opus Cleopatra like [0] had done for Adventure Story before accepting the role, which came with a stipend of $4,000 a weekThomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury who was martyred by Henry II of England,. Writing for The Christian Science Monitor, Peter Rainer labelled [0] as \"extraordinary\". Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times appreciated [0]'s on-screen chemistry with co-actor and friend Peter O'Toole's and thought the role, which came with a stipend of $4,000 a week Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury who was martyred by Henry II of England, served as \"a reminder of how fine an actor [0] was\". the film adaptation of Jean Anouilh's historical play Becket received twelve Oscar nominations, including Best Actor for both Loewe and Hartco-actor and friend Peter O'Toole's; both Loewe and Hart lost to Harrison for My Fair Lady (1964). both Loewe and Hart co-actor and friend Peter O'Toole's also received nominations for Best Actor\u00a0\u2013 Motion Picture Drama at the 22nd Golden Globe Awards, with co-actor and friend Peter O'Toole's emerging victorious. [0]'s triumph at the box office continued with [0]'s next appearance as the defrocked clergyman Dr. T. Lawrence Shannon in Tennessee Williams''s The Night of the Iguana (1964) directed by John Huston; The Night of the Iguana (1964) directed by John Huston was also critically well received. Alpert believed [0]'s success was due to how well [0] varied [0]'s acting with the three female characters, each of whom [0] tries to seduce differently: Ava Gardner (the randy hotel owner), Sue Lyon (the nubile American tourist), and Deborah Kerr (the poor, repressed artist). The success of Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury who was martyred by Henry II of England, and The Night of the Iguana (1964) directed by John Huston led Time magazine to term [0] \"the new Mr. Box Office\".During the production of Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury who was martyred by Henry II of England,, [0] went to watch Gielgud perform in the 1963 stage adaptation of Thornton Wilder's 1948 novel, The Ides of March. There [0] was confronted by Gielgud who asked what [0] planned to do as a part of the celebration of Shakespeare's's quatercentenary. [0] told Gielgud [0] was approached by theatrical producer Alexander H. Cohen to do Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury who was martyred by Henry II of England, in New York. [0] had accepted theatrical producer Alexander H. Cohen's under the condition that Gielgud would direct Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury who was martyred by Henry II of England,, which [0] conveyed  to Gielgud. Gielgud agreed and soon production began in January 1964 after [0] had completed [0]'s work in Becket and The Night of the Iguana (1964) directed by John Huston. Taking into account [0]'s dislike for wearing period clothing, as well as fellow actor Harley Granville-Barker's notion that Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury who was martyred by Henry II of England, was best approached as a \"permanent rehearsal\", Gielgud decided for Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury who was martyred by Henry II of England, to be performed in a 'rehearsal' version with an incomplete set with the actors performing wearing the actors's own clothes. Unaccustomed to this freedom, the actors found it hard to select the appropriate clothes and wore different attire day by day. After the first performance in Toronto, Gielgud decreed that the actors must wear capes as Gielgud felt it \"lacked colour\". In addition to being Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury who was martyred by Henry II of England,'s director, Gielgud appeared as the Ghost of Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury who was martyred by Henry II of England,'s father. According to Gielgud's biographer Jonathan Croall, [0]'s basic reading of Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury who was martyred by Henry II of England, was \"a much more vigorous, extrovert\" version of Gielgud's own performance in 1936. [0] varied [0]'s interpretations of Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury who was martyred by Henry II of England, in later performances; [0] even tried a homosexual Hamlet.When Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury who was martyred by Henry II of England, debuted at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre in New York City, [0] garnered good reviews for his portrayal of a \"bold and virile\" HamletThomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury who was martyred by Henry II of England,. Howard Taubman of The New York Times called his portrayal of a \"bold and virile\" Hamlet \"a performance of electrical power and sweeping virility\", noting that Howard Taubman of The New York Times had never known or seen \"a Hamlet of such tempestuous manliness\". A critic from Time magazine said that [0] \"put [0]'s passion into Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury who was martyred by Henry II of England,'s language rather than Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury who was martyred by Henry II of England,. [0]'s acting is a technician's marvel. [0]'s voice has gem-cutting precision.\" Walter Kerr felt that though [0] carried \"a certain lack of feeling\" in his portrayal of a \"bold and virile\" Hamlet, Walter Kerr appreciated [0]'s \"reverberating\" vocal projections. The opening night party was a lavish affair, attended by six hundred celebrities. Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury who was martyred by Henry II of England, ran for 137 performances, beating the previous record set by Gielgud in 1936. The most successful aspect of The production, apart from his portrayal of a \"bold and virile\" Hamlet, was generally considered to be Hume Cronyn's's performance as Polonius, winning Hume Cronyn's the only Tony Award Hume Cronyn's would ever receive in a competitive category. [0] was nominated for [0]'s second Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play but lost to Alec Guinness for Alec Guinness's portrayal of the poet Dylan Thomas. his portrayal of a \"bold and virile\" Hamlet was immortalised in a film that was created by recording three live performances on camera from 30 June 1964 to 1 July 1964 using a process called Electronovision; a film that was created by recording three live performances on camera from 30 June 1964 to 1 July 1964 using a process called Electronovision played in US theatres for a week in 1964. Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury who was martyred by Henry II of England, was also the subject of books written by cast members William Redfield and Richard L. Sterne.[0] had a theory that Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury who was martyred by Henry II of England, could be played a hundred ways, and [0] tested every one of a hundred ways. Within one scene, you might get Heathcliff, Sir Toby Belch, and Peck's Bad Boy.Alfred Drake, who played King Claudius, on how [0] made variations to Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury who was martyred by Henry II of England,Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury who was martyred by Henry II of England,.[0] helped Taylor's make Taylor's's stage debut in A Poetry Reading, a recitation of poems by the couple as well as anecdotes and quotes from the plays Burton had participated in thus far. The idea was conceived by [0] as a benefit performance for [0]'s mentor Philip, whose conservatory, the American Musical and Dramatic Academy, had fallen short of funds. A Poetry Reading, a recitation of poems by the couple as well as anecdotes and quotes from the plays Burton had participated in thus far opened at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre in New York City on 21 June 1964 to a packed house; both Loewe and Hart received a standing ovation at the end of both Loewe and Hart's performance. [0] remarked on Taylor's's performance, \"[0] didn't know Taylor's was going to be this good.\"After Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury who was martyred by Henry II of England, came to a close in August 1964, both Loewe and Hart continued making films together. The first film after both Loewe and Hart's marriage, The Sandpiper, was poorly received but still became a commercially successful venture. According to Bragg, the films both Loewe and Hart made during the mid-1960s contained a lot of innuendos that referred directly to both Loewe and Hart's private lives. [0] went on to star opposite Claire Bloom and Oskar Werner in The Spy Who Came In from the Cold (1965), a Cold War espionage story about a British Intelligence agent, Alec Leamas ([0]), who is sent to East Germany on a mission to find and expose a mole working within his organisation for an East German Intelligence officer, Hans-Dieter Mundt (Peter van Eyck). Martin Ritt, the film's director and producer, wanted Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury who was martyred by Henry II of England, to exhibit more anonymity, which meant no display of eloquent speeches or intense emotional moments. Bragg believed wanted worried [0], as [0] had generated [0]'s reputation as an actor with those exact traits, and wondered how the film adaptation of Jean Anouilh's historical play Becket's would turn out. Ritt, a non-drinker, was displeased with Burton's drinking habits as Martin Ritt, the film's director and producer, felt Burton's drinking habits \"lacked a certain discipline\" and expected the same level of commitment from [0] as everyone else during filming. In spite of their differences, Alpert notes that the film adaptation of Jean Anouilh's historical play Becket transpired well. Based on the 1963 novel of the same name by John le Carr\u00e9, Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury who was martyred by Henry II of England, garnered positive reviews, with Fernando F. Croce of Slant Magazine describing his portrayal of a \"bold and virile\" Hamlet as more of \"tragic patsy than swashbuckler\" and believed [0]'s scenes with Oskar Werner \"have sharp doses of suspicion, cynicism and sadness\". Dave Kehr of the Chicago Reader called the film adaptation of Jean Anouilh's historical play Becket \"Grim, monotonous, and rather facile\", Dave Kehr of the Chicago Reader found the role, which came with a stipend of $4,000 a week had \"some honest poignancy\". Variety thought [0] fitted \"neatly into the role, which came with a stipend of $4,000 a week\". [0] also made a brief appearance 1964 in Clive Donner's comedy What's New Pussycat? as a man who meets the womaniser Michael James (O'Toole) in a bar.In 1966, both Loewe and Hart enjoyed both Loewe and Hart's greatest on-screen success in Mike Nichols's's film version of Edward Albee's's black comedy play Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, in which both Loewe and Hart trade vicious barbs in front of both Loewe and Hart's guests, Nick (George Segal) and Honey (Sandy Dennis). [0] wanted Taylor's for the character of Martha \"to stop everyone else from playing the character of Martha\". [0] didn't want anyone else to do the character of Martha as [0] thought it could be for Taylor's what Hamlet was for [0]. [0] was not the first choice for the role of George. Jack Lemmon was offered the role of George initially, but when Jack Lemmon turned the role of George down, Warner Bros. president Jack L. Warner agreed on [0] and paid [0] $750,000. Mike Nichols's was hired to helm director Joseph L. Mankiewicz's magnum opus Cleopatra at Taylor's's request, despite having never directed a film. Edward Albee's preferred Bette Davis and James Mason for the character of Martha respectively, fearing that both Loewe and Hart's strong screen presence would dominate the film adaptation of Jean Anouilh's historical play Becket. Instead, the film adaptation of Jean Anouilh's historical play Becket proved to be what Alpert described as \"the summit of both Loewe and Hart's careers\".The film's script, adapted from Albee's play by Ernest Lehman, broke new ground for The film's script, adapted from Albee's play by Ernest Lehman,'s raw language and harsh depiction of marriage. So immersed had both Loewe and Hart become in Martha and George Martha and George the character of Martha over the months of shooting that, after director Joseph L. Mankiewicz's magnum opus Cleopatra was wrapped up, both Loewe and Hart found it difficult not to be Martha and George, \"[0] feel rather lost.\" Later both Loewe and Hart would state that the film adaptation of Jean Anouilh's historical play Becket took the film adaptation of Jean Anouilh's historical play Becket's toll on both Loewe and Hart's relationship, and that Taylor's was \"tired of playing the character of Martha\" in real life. Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? garnered critical acclaim, with film critic Stanley Kauffmann of The New York Times calling the film adaptation of Jean Anouilh's historical play Becket \"one of the most scathingly honest American films ever made\". film critic Stanley Kauffmann of The New York Times observed [0] to be \"utterly convincing as a man with a great lake of nausea in him, on which he sails with regret and compulsive amusementa man with a great lake of nausea in him, on which he sails with regret and compulsive amusementa man with a great lake of nausea in him, on which he sails with regret and compulsive amusement \", and Taylor's \"does the best work of Taylor's's career, sustained and urgent\". In her's review for The New York Daily News, her thought Taylor's \"nothing less than brilliant as the shrewish, slovenly. blasphemous, frustrated, slightly wacky, alcoholic wife\" while noting that director Joseph L. Mankiewicz's magnum opus Cleopatra gave [0] \"a chance to display [0]'s disciplined art in the role of the victim of a wife's vituperative tongue\". However, Andrew Sarris of The Village Voice criticised Taylor's, believing Taylor's's performance \"lack[ed] genuine warmth\" but Andrew Sarris of The Village Voice's review of [0] was more favourable, noting that [0] gave \"a performance of electrifying charm\". Although the actors received Academy Award nominations for the actors's roles in director Joseph L. Mankiewicz's magnum opus Cleopatra, only Taylor and Dennis went on to win. both Loewe and Hart won both Loewe and Hart's first BAFTA Awards for Best British Actor and Best British Actress respectively; [0] also for [0]'s role in Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury who was martyred by Henry II of England,.both Loewe and Hart next performed a 1966 Oxford Playhouse adaptation of Christopher Marlowe's Doctor Faustus; both Loewe and Hart did a 1966 Oxford Playhouse adaptation of Christopher Marlowe's Doctor Faustus to benefit the Oxford University Dramatic Society and as a token of [0]'s gratitude to Nevill Coghill. [0] starred as Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury who was martyred by Henry II of England, while Taylor's played Taylor's's first stage role as Helen of Troy, a non-speaking part. a 1966 Oxford Playhouse adaptation of Christopher Marlowe's Doctor Faustus received negative reviews but both Loewe and Hart's performances were reviewed constructively. Irving Wardle of the Los Angeles Times called a 1966 Oxford Playhouse adaptation of Christopher Marlowe's Doctor Faustus \"University drama at University drama's worst\" while the American newspaper columnist John Crosby, in the American newspaper columnist John Crosby's review for The Observer, lauded Burton's speech where he asks God to be merciful, stating that: \"It takes a great actor to deliver Burton's speech where he asks God to be merciful without wringing a strangled sob of laughter out of one. But [0] did Burton's speech where he asks God to be merciful.\" a 1966 Oxford Playhouse adaptation of Christopher Marlowe's Doctor Faustus nevertheless made $22,000 dollars, which Nevill Coghill was happy with. Christopher Marlowe's Doctor Faustus was adapted for the screen the following year by both Loewe and Hart, with [0] making [0]'s directorial debut. [0] also co-produced the film with both Loewe and Hart; the film was critically panned and was a box office failure. both Loewe and Hart's next collaboration was Franco Zeffirelli's lively version of Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew (1967). Franco Zeffirelli's lively version of Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew (1967) was a challenge for [0]Taylor's , noting that [0] was \"permitted to do extreme physical things that wouldn't have been allowed with any other actress\". Franco Zeffirelli's recalled that Taylor's Shakespeare's \"gave the more interesting performance because Taylor's invented the character of Martha from scratch\". Of [0], Franco Zeffirelli's felt [0] was, to an extent, \"affected by [0]'s knowledge of the classics\". Franco Zeffirelli's lively version of Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew (1967) also became a notable critical and commercial success. [0] had another quick collaboration with Franco Zeffirelli's narrating the documentary, Florence: Days of Destruction, which was about the 1966 flood of the Arno that devastated the city of Florence, Italy; the documentary, Florence: Days of Destruction, which was about the 1966 flood of the Arno that devastated the city of Florence, Italy raised $20\u00a0million for the flood relief efforts. By the end of 1967, the combined box office gross of films both Loewe and Hart had acted in had reached $200\u00a0million. According to biographers John Cottrell and Fergus Cashin, when both Loewe and Hart contemplated taking a three-month break from acting, Hollywood \"almost had a nervous breakdown\" as nearly half the U.S. cinema industry's income for films in theatrical distribution came from pictures starring one or both of both Loewe and Hart. Later collaborations from both Loewe and Hart like The Comedians (1967), which was based on Graham Greene's 1966 novel of the same name, and the Tennessee Williams' adaptation Boom! (1967) were critical and commercial failures.In 1967, [0] enjoyed a commercial blockbuster with Clint Eastwood in the World War II action film Where Eagles Dare; [0] received a $1\u00a0million fee plus a share of the World War II action film Where Eagles Dare's box office gross. According to [0]'s daughter Kate Burton, \"[0] did the World War II action film Where Eagles Dare for us kids, because us kids kept asking [0], 'Can [0] do a fun movie that us kids can go see?'\" Clint Eastwood thought the script \"terrible\" and was \"all exposition and complications\". Clint Eastwood asked the World War II action film Where Eagles Dare's producer Elliott Kastner and the World War II action film Where Eagles Dare's screenwriter Alistair MacLean to be given less dialogue, later remarking \"Clint Eastwood just stood around firing Clint Eastwood's machine gun while [0] handled the dialogue.\" [0] enjoyed working with Clint Eastwood and said of the World War II action film Where Eagles Dare that [0] \"did all the talking and [Clint Eastwood] did all the killing\". [0]'s last film of the decade, Anne of the Thousand Days (1969) for which [0] was paid $1.25\u00a0million, (equivalent to $9,975,045 in 2022) was commercially successful but garnered mixed opinions from reviewers. Noted British film critic Tom Milne of Time Out magazine believed that [0] \"plays throughout on a monotonous note of bluff ferocity\". Conversely, Vincent Canby of the Los Angeles Times appreciated the role, which came with a stipend of $4,000 a week, noting that [0] \"is in excellent form and voice\u2014funny, loutish and sometimes wise\". Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury who was martyred by Henry II of England, received ten nominations at the 42nd Academy Awards, including one for [0]'s performance as Henry II of England, which many thought to be largely the result of an expensive advertising campaign by Universal Studios.
