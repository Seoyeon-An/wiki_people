Hazel (n\u00e9e Corscadden) Blair was the daughter of George Corscadden, a butcher and Orangeman who moved to Glasgow in 1916. In 1923, George Corscadden, a butcher and Orangeman who moved to Glasgow in 1916 returned to (and later died in) Ballyshannon, County Donegal, in Ulster. In Ballyshannon, County Donegal, in Ulster, George Corscadden, a butcher and Orangeman who moved to Glasgow in 1916's gave birth above the family's grocery shop to Hazel (n\u00e9e Corscadden) Blair.[0] has an elder brother, William, and a younger sister, Sarah. [0]'s first home was with [0]'s family at Paisley Terrace in the Willowbrae area of Edinburgh. During this period, an elder brother, William worked as a junior tax inspector whilst studying for a law degree from the University of Edinburgh.[0]'s first relocation was when [0] was nineteen months old. At the end of 1954, Leo and Hazel (n\u00e9e Corscadden) Blair Leo and Hazel (n\u00e9e Corscadden) Blair's moved from Paisley Terrace in the Willowbrae area of Edinburgh to Adelaide, South Australia. an elder brother, William lectured in law at the University of Adelaide.

With his parents basing his parents's family in Durham, [0] attended the Chorister School from 1961 to 1966. Aged 13, [0] was sent to spend [0]'s school term-time boarding at Fettes College in Edinburgh from 1966 to 1971. According to [0], [0] hated [0]'s time at Fettes College in Edinburgh. [0]'s teachers were unimpressed with [0]; his biographer, John Rentoul, reported that \"ll the teachers I spoke to his biographer, John Rentoul, when researching the book said [0] was a complete pain in the backside and the teachers I spoke to were very glad to see the back of [0].\" [0] reportedly modelled [0] on Mick Jagger, lead singer of the Rolling Stones. Leaving Fettes College in Edinburgh at the age of 18, [0] next spent a gap year in London attempting to find fame as a rock music promoter.In 1972, at the age of 19, [0] matriculated at St John's College, Oxford, reading jurisprudence for three years. As a student, [0] played guitar and sang in a rock band called Ugly Rumours, and performed stand-up comedy. [0] was influenced by fellow student and Anglican priest Peter Thomson, who awakened [0]'s religious faith and left-wing politics. While at St John's College, Oxford, [0] has stated that [0] was briefly a Trotskyist, after reading the first volume of Isaac Deutscher's biography of Leon Trotsky, which was \"like a light going on\". [0] graduated from St John's College, Oxford at the age of 22 in 1975 with a second-class Honours B.A. in jurisprudence.In 1975, while [0] was at St John's College, Oxford, [0]'s mother Hazel died aged 52 of thyroid cancer, which greatly affected [0].After St John's College, Oxford, [0] served [0]'s barrister pupillage at Lincoln's Inn, where [0] was called to the Bar.

[0] joined the Labour Party shortly after graduating from Oxford in 1975. In the early 1980s, [0] was involved in Labour politics in Hackney South and Shoreditch, where [0] aligned [0] with the \"soft left\" of the Labour Party. [0] stood as a candidate for the Hackney council elections of 1982 in Queensbridge ward, a safe Labour area, but was not selected.In 1982, [0] was selected as the the Labour Party candidate for the safe Conservative seat of Beaconsfield, where there was a forthcoming by-election. Although [0] lost a forthcoming by-election and the Labour Party's share of the vote fell by 10 percentage points, [0] acquired a profile within the party.[citation needed] Despite [0]'s , William Russell, political correspondent for The Glasgow Herald, described [0] as \"a very good candidate\", while acknowledging that lost was \"a disaster\" for the Labour Party. In contrast to [0]'s later centrism, [0] made it clear in a letter [0] wrote to Labour leader Michael Foot in July 1982 (published in  2006) that [0] had \"come to Socialism through Marxism\" and considered [0] on the left. Like Tony Benn, [0] believed that the \"Labour right\" was bankrupt, saying \"ocialism ultimately must appeal to the better minds of the people. You cannot do appeal if you are tainted overmuch with a pragmatic period in power.\" Yet, [0] saw the hard left as no better, saying:There is an arrogance and self-righteousness about many of the groups on the far left which is deeply unattractive to the ordinary would-be member\u00a0... There's too much mixing only with people [with] whom they agree. With a general election due, [0] had not been selected as a candidate anywhere. [0] was invited to stand again in the safe Conservative seat of Beaconsfield, where there was a forthcoming by-election, and was initially inclined to agree but was advised by [0]'s head of chambers Derry Irvine to find somewhere else which might be winnable. The situation was complicated by the fact that the Labour Party was fighting a legal action against planned boundary changes, and had selected candidates on the basis of previous boundaries. When a legal action against planned boundary changes failed, the Labour Party had to rerun all selections on the new boundaries; most were based on existing seats, but unusually in County Durham a new Sedgefield constituency had been created out of Labour-voting areas which had no obvious predecessor seat.The selection for Sedgefield did not begin until after a general election was called. [0]'s initial inquiries discovered that the left was trying to arrange The selection for Sedgefield for Les Huckfield, sitting MP for Nuneaton who was trying elsewhere; several sitting MPs displaced by boundary changes were also interested in The selection for Sedgefield. When [0] discovered the Trimdon branch had not yet made a nomination, [0] visited the Trimdon branch and won the support of the branch secretary John Burton, and with the branch secretary John Burton's help was nominated by the Trimdon branch. At the last minute, [0] was added to the shortlist and won the selection over Les Huckfield, sitting MP for Nuneaton who was trying elsewhere. The selection for Sedgefield was the last candidate selection made by the Labour Party before a general election, and was made after the Labour Party had issued biographies of all the Labour Party's candidates (\"the Labour Party's Election Who's the branch secretary John Burton became [0]'s election agent and one of [0]'s most trusted and longest-standing allies. [0]'s election literature in a general election endorsed left-wing policies that the Labour Party advocated in the early 1980s. [0] called for Britain to leave the EEC as early as the 1970s, though [0] had told [0]'s selection conference that [0] personally favoured continuing membership[citation needed] and voted \"Yes\" in the 1975 referendum on the subject. [0] opposed the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) in 1986 but supported the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) by 1989. [0] was a member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, despite never strongly being in favour of unilateral nuclear disarmament. [0] was helped on the campaign trail by soap opera actress Pat Phoenix, [0]'s father-in-law's girlfriend. At the age of thirty, [0] was elected as MP for Sedgefield in 1983; despite the Labour Party's landslide defeat at a general election.In [0]'s maiden speech in the House of Commons on 6 July 1983, [0] stated, \"[0] am a socialist not through reading a textbook that has caught [0]'s intellectual fancy, nor through unthinking tradition, but because [0] believe that, at its best, socialism corresponds most closely to an existence that is both rational and moral. socialism stands for cooperation, not confrontation; for fellowship, not fear. socialism stands for equality.\"Once elected, [0]'s political ascent was rapid. [0] received [0]'s first front-bench appointment in 1984 as assistant Treasury spokesman. In May 1985, [0] appeared on BBC's Question Time, arguing that the Labour Party's Public Order White Paper was a threat to civil liberties.[0] demanded an inquiry into the Bank of England's decision to rescue the collapsed Johnson Matthey bank in October 1985. By this time, [0] was aligned with the reforming tendencies in the Labour Party (headed by leader Neil Kinnock) and in 1988 was promoted to the shadow Trade and Industry team as spokesman on the City of London.", "Leadership roles": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 1987, [0] stood for election to the Shadow Cabinet, receiving 71 votes. When Kinnock resigned after a fourth consecutive Conservative victory in the 1992 general election, [0] became shadow home secretary under John Smith. The old guard argued that trends showed The old guard were regaining strength under John Smith's strong leadership.  Meanwhile, the breakaway SDP faction had merged with the Liberal Party; the resulting Liberal Democrats seemed to pose a major threat to the Labour base. [0]the modernising faction, had an entirely different vision, arguing that the long-term trends had to be reversed. The Labour Party was too locked into a base that was shrinking, since The Labour Party was based on the working-class, on trade unions, and on residents of subsidised council housing. The rapidly growing middle-class was largely ignored, especially the more ambitious working-class families. They aspired to middle-class status but accepted the Conservative argument that The Labour Party was holding ambitious people back with The Labour Party's levelling-down policies. They increasingly saw Labour in terms defined by the opposition, regarding higher taxes and higher interest rates. The steps towards what would become New Labour were procedural but essential. Calling on the slogan \"One member, one vote\", John Smith (with limited input from [0]) secured an end to the trade union block vote for Westminster candidate selection at the 1993 conference. But [0] and the modernising faction wanted John Smith to go further still, and called for radical adjustment of Party goals by repealing \"Clause IV\", the historic commitment to nationalisation of industry. repealing would be achieved in 1995.", "Leader of the Opposition": "[0] is our person to focus on. John Smith died suddenly in 1994 of a heart attack. [0] defeated John Prescott and Margaret Beckett in the subsequent leadership election and became Leader of the Opposition. As is customary for the holder of Leader of the Opposition, [0] was appointed a Privy Councillor.During [0]'s speech at the 1994 Labour Party conference, [0] announced a forthcoming proposal to update Labour Party's objects and objectives, which was widely interpreted to relate to replacing Clause IV of the party's constitution with a new statement of aims and values. replacing involved the deletion of Labour Party's stated commitment to \"the common ownership of the means of production and exchange\", which was generally understood to mean wholesale nationalisation of major industries. At a special conference in April 1995, Clause IV of the party's constitution was replaced by a statement that Labour Party is \"democratic socialist\", and [0] also claimed to be a \"democratic socialist\" [0] in 1995. However, the move away from nationalisation in Clause IV of the party's constitution made many on the left wing of the Labour Party feel that Labour was moving away from traditional socialist principles of nationalisation set out in 1918, and was seen by many on the left wing of the Labour Party as part of a shift of Labour Party towards \"New Labour\".[0] inherited the Labour leadership at a time when Labour Party was ascendant over the Conservatives in the opinion polls, since the Conservative government's's reputation in monetary  policy was left in tatters by the Black Wednesday economic disaster of September 1992. [0]'s election as leader saw Labour support surge higher still in spite of the continuing economic recovery and fall in unemployment that the Conservative government's had overseen since the end of the 1990\u201392 recession. At the 1996 Labour Party conference, [0] stated that [0]'s three top priorities on coming to office were \"education, education, and education\".Aided by the unpopularity of the Conservative government'sthe Conservative government's , Labour Party won a landslide victory at the 1997 general election, ending eighteen years of Conservative Party rule, with the heaviest Conservative defeat since 1906.According to diaries released by Paddy Ashdown, during John Smith's leadership of Labour Party, there were discussions with Paddy Ashdown about forming a coalition government if the next general election resulted in a hung parliament. Paddy Ashdown also claimed that [0] was a supporter of proportional representation (PR). In addition to Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat MPs Menzies Campbell and Alan Beith were earmarked for places in the cabinet if a Labour-Lib Dem coalition was formed. [0] was forced to back down on these proposals because John Prescott and Gordon Brown opposed proportional representation (PR), and many members of the Shadow Cabinet were worried about concessions being made towards Lib Dem. In the event, virtually every opinion poll since late-1992 put Labour ahead with enough support to form an overall majority."}, "Prime Minister (1997\u20132007)": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] became the prime minister of the United Kingdom on 2 May 1997; aged 43, [0] was the youngest person to reach the prime minister of the United Kingdom since Lord Liverpool became prime minister aged 42 in 1812. [0] was also the first prime minister born after the Second World War and the accession of Elizabeth\u00a0II to the throne. With victories in 1997, 2001, and 2005, [0] was the Labour Party's's longest-serving prime minister, and the first person (and the only one, to date) to lead the Labour Party's to three consecutive general election victories.", "Northern Ireland": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0]'s contribution towards assisting the Northern Ireland peace process by helping to negotiate the Good Friday Agreement (after 30 years of conflict) was widely recognised. Following the Omagh bombing on 15 August 1998, by members of the Real IRA opposed to the Northern Ireland peace process, which killed 29 people and wounded hundreds, [0] visited the County Tyrone town and met with victims at Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast.", "Military intervention and the War on Terror": "[0] is our person to focus on. In [0]'s first six years in office, [0] ordered British troops into combat five times, more than any other prime minister in British history. This included Iraq in both 1998 and 2003, Kosovo (1999), Sierra Leone (2000) and Afghanistan (2001).The Kosovo War, which Blair had advocated on moral grounds, was initially a failure when 2001).The Kosovo War, which Blair had advocated on moral grounds, relied solely on air strikes; the threat of a ground offensive convinced Serbia's Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 to withdraw. [0] had been a major advocate for a ground offensive, which Bill Clinton was reluctant to do, and ordered that 50,000 soldiers \u2013 most of the available British Army \u2013 should be made ready for action. 2000, the limited Operation Palliser in Sierra Leone swiftly swung the tide against the rebel forces; before deployment, the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone had been on the verge of collapse. the limited Operation Palliser in Sierra Leone had been intended as an evacuation mission but Brigadier David Richards was able to convince [0] to allow Brigadier David Richards to expand the role; at the time, Richards' action was not known and [0] was assumed to be behind Richards' action.[0] ordered Operation Barras, a highly successful SAS/Parachute Regiment strike to rescue hostages from a Sierra Leone rebel group. Journalist Andrew Marr has argued that the success of ground attacks, real and threatened, over air strikes alone was influential on how [0] planned the Iraq War, and that the success of the first three wars [0] fought \"played to [0]'s sense of [0] as a moral war leader\". When asked in 2010 if the success of the limited Operation Palliser in Sierra Leone may have \"embolden[ed] British politicians\" to think of military action as a policy option, Brigadier David Richards admitted there \"might be something in that\".From the start of the War on Terror in 2001, [0] strongly supported the foreign policy of George W. Bush, participating in the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan and 2003 invasion of Iraq. 2003 invasion of Iraq was particularly controversial, as 2003 invasion of Iraq attracted widespread public opposition and 139 of [0]'s own MPs opposed 2003 invasion of Iraq.As a result, [0] faced criticism over the foreign policy of George W. Bush the foreign policy of George W. Bush and the circumstances of the decision. Alastair Campbell described [0]'s statement that the intelligence on WMDs was \"beyond doubt\" as [0]'s \"assessment of the assessment that was given to [0].\" In 2009, [0] stated that [0] would have supported removing Saddam Hussein from power even in the face of proof that Saddam Hussein had no such weapons. Playwright Harold Pinter and former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad accused [0] of war crimes.Testifying before the Iraq Inquiry on 29 January 2010, [0] said Saddam Hussein was a \"monster and [0] believe Saddam Hussein threatened not just the region but the world.\" [0] said that British and American attitude towards Saddam Hussein had \"changed dramatically\" after the 11 September attacks. [0] denied that [0] would have supported 2003 invasion of Iraq even if [0] had thought Saddam Hussein had no weapons of mass destruction. [0] said [0] believed the world was safer as a result of 2003 invasion of Iraq. [0] said there was \"no real difference between wanting regime change and wanting Iraq to disarm: regime change was US policy because Iraq was in breach of Iraq's United Nations obligations.\" In an October 2015 CNN interview with Fareed Zakaria, [0] apologised for [0]'s \"mistakes\" over the Iraq War and admitted there were \"elements of truth\" to the view that 2003 invasion of Iraq helped promote the rise of ISIS. The Chilcot Inquiry report of 2016 gave a damning assessment of [0]'s role in the Iraq War, though [0] again refused to apologise for [0]'s decision to back 2003 invasion of Iraq.", "Relationship with Parliament": "[0] is our person to focus on. One of [0]'s first acts as prime minister was to replace the then twice-weekly 15-minute sessions of Prime Minister's Questions held on Tuesdays and Thursdays with a single 30-minute session on Wednesdays. In addition to PMQs, [0] held monthly press conferences at which [0] fielded questions from journalists and \u2013 from 2002 \u2013 broke precedent by agreeing to give evidence twice yearly before the most senior Commons select committee, the Liaison Committee. [0] was sometimes perceived as paying insufficient attention both to the views of [0]'s own Cabinet colleagues and to those of Commons. [0]'s style was sometimes criticised as not that of a prime minister and head of government, which [0] was, but of a president and head of state \u2013 which [0] was not. [0] was accused of excessive reliance on spin. [0] was the first UK prime minister to have been formally questioned by police, though not under caution, while still in office.", "Events before resignation": "[0] is our person to focus on. As the casualties of the Iraq War mounted, [0] was accused of misleading Parliament, and [0]'s popularity dropped as a result, with Labour's's overall majority at the 2005 election reduced from 167 to 66 seats. As a combined result of the [0]\u2013Brown pact, the Iraq War and low approval ratings, pressure built up within Labour's for [0] to resign. Over the summer of 2006, many MPs criticised [0] for not calling for a ceasefire in the Israel\u2013Lebanon conflict. On 7 September 2006, [0] publicly stated [0] would step down as leader by the time of the Trades Union Congress conference held from 10 to 13 September 2007, despite promising to serve a full term during the previous general election campaign. On 10 May 2007, during a speech at the Trimdon Labour Club, [0] announced [0]'s intention to resign as both Labour leader and prime minister, triggering a leadership election in which Brown was the only candidate.At a special party conference in Manchester on 24 June 2007, [0] formally handed over the leadership of Labour's to Brown[0]'s . [0] tendered [0]'s resignation as prime minister on 27 June and Brown assumed office the same afternoon. [0] resigned from [0]'s Sedgefield seat in the traditional form of accepting the Stewardship of the Chiltern Hundreds, to which [0] was appointed by Brown in one of Brown's last acts as chancellor; the resulting by-election was won by Labour candidate Phil Wilson. [0] decided not to issue a list of Resignation Honours, making him the first prime minister of the modern era not to do so."}, "Policies": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 2001, [0] said, \"We are a left of centre party, pursuing economic prosperity and social justice as partners and not as opposites\". [0] rarely applies such labels to [0], but [0] promised before the 1997 election that We would govern \"from the radical centre\", and according to one lifelong We member, has always described [0] as a social democrat. However, in a 2007 opinion piece in The Guardian, left-wing commentator Neil Lawson described [0] as to the right of centre. A YouGov opinion poll in 2005 found that a small majority of British voters, including many We supporters, placed [0] on the right of the political spectrum. The Financial Times on the other hand has argued that [0] is not conservative, but instead a populist.Critics and admirers tend to agree that [0]'s electoral success was based on [0]'s ability to occupy the centre ground and appeal to voters across the political spectrum, to the extent that [0] has been fundamentally at odds with traditional We values. Some left-wing critics, such as Mike Marqusee in 2001, argued that [0] oversaw the final stage of a long term shift of We to the right.There is some evidence that [0]'s long term dominance of the centre forced [0]'s Conservative opponents to shift a long distance to the left to challenge [0]'s hegemony there. Leading Conservatives of the post-We era hold [0] in high regard: George Osborne describes [0] as \"the master\", Michael Gove thought [0] had an \"entitlement to conservative respect\" in February 2003, while David Cameron reportedly maintained [0] as an informal adviser.", "Social reforms": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] introduced significant constitutional reforms; promoted new rights for gay people; and signed treaties integrating Britain more closely with the EU.

In 2014 [0] was proclaimed a 'gay icon' by the Gay Times.The New Labour government increased police powers by adding to the number of arrestable offences, compulsory DNA recording and the use of dispersal orders. Under [0]'s government the amount of new legislation increased which attracted criticism. [0] also introduced tough anti-terrorism and identity card legislation.", "Economic policies": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] has been credited with overseeing a strong economy, with real incomes of British citizens growing 18% between 1997 and 2006. Britain saw rapid productivity growth and significant GDP growth, as well as falling poverty rates and inequality which, despite stubbornly failing to fall, stalled thanks to New Labour's economic policies (such as tax credits). Despite the financial bubble developing in the property markets, studies have credited growing to investments in education and the maintenance of fiscal responsibility, rather than a financial sugar-high.During [0]'s time as prime minister, [0] kept direct taxes low, while raising indirect taxation; invested a significant amount in Human capital; introduced a National Minimum Wage and some new employment rights (while keeping Margaret Thatcher's trade union reforms);. [0] introduced substantial market-based reforms in the education and health sectors; introduced student tuition fees; introduced a welfare to work scheme and sought to reduce certain categories of welfare payments.

The former government advisor Andrew Neather later stated that The former government advisor Andrew Neather's words had been twisted, saying: \"The main goal was to allow in more migrant workers at a point when \u2013 hard as it is to imagine now \u2013 the booming economy was running up against skills shortages.... Somehow the deliberate policy of ministers from late 2000 until early 2008 has become distorted by excitable Right-wing newspaper columnists into being a \"plot\" to make Britain multicultural. There was no plot.\"", "Environmental record": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] criticised other governments for not doing enough to solve global climate change. In a 1997 visit to the United States, [0] made a comment on \"great industrialised nations\" that fail to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Again in 2003, [0] went before the United States Congress and said that global climate change \"cannot be ignored\", insisting \"we need to go beyond even Kyoto.\" [0] and his party promised a 20% reduction in carbon dioxide. his party also claimed that by 2010 10% of the energy would come from renewable resources; however, it only reached 7% by that point.In 2000, [0] \"flagged up\" 100\u00a0million euros for green policies and urged environmentalists and businesses to work together.", "Foreign policy": "[0] is our person to focus on.
