[0] has two younger siblings, Marcus Kasner, a physicist, and Irene Kasner, an occupational therapist. In [0]'s childhood and youth, [0] was known among [0]'s peers by the nickname \"Kasi\", derived from [0]'s last name Kasner.[page\u00a0[0] is of German and Polish descent. Her paternal grandfather, Ludwik Kasner, was a German policeman of Polish ethnicity. After being captured in France during World War I, Her paternal grandfather, Ludwik Kasner, joined the Blue Army and likely fought against Germany. Her paternal grandfather, Ludwik Kasner, married Merkel's grandmother Margarethe, a German from Berlin, and relocated to Merkel's grandmother Margarethe, a German from Berlin,'s hometown where Her paternal grandfather, Ludwik Kasner, again worked in the police. In 1930, they Germanised the Polish name Ka\u017amierczak to Kasner. [0]'s maternal grandparents were the Danzig (now Gda\u0144sk, Poland) politician Willi Jentzsch and Gertrud Alma (n\u00e9e Drange), a daughter of the city clerk of Elbing (now Elbl\u0105g, Poland) Emil Drange. Since the mid-1990s, [0] has publicly mentioned her Polish heritage on several occasions and described [0] as a quarter Polish, but her Polish heritage became better known as a result of a 2013 biography.Religion played a key role in the Kasner family's's migration from West Germany to East Germany. Her paternal grandfather, Ludwik Kasner, was originally Catholic but the Kasner family's converted to Lutheranism during the childhood of Horst Kasner (1926\u20132011; n\u00e9 Ka\u017amierczak), a Lutheran pastor and a native of Berlin,. In 1954, when [0] was just three months old, Horst Kasner (1926\u20132011; n\u00e9 Ka\u017amierczak), a Lutheran pastor and a native of Berlin, received a pastorate at the church in Quitzow\u00a0[de] (a district of Perleberg in Brandenburg), which was then in East Germany. the Kasner family's moved to Templin and [0] grew up in the countryside 90\u00a0km (56\u00a0mi) north of East Germany.In 1968, [0] joined the Free German Youth (FDJ), the official communist youth movement sponsored by the ruling Marxist\u2013Leninist Socialist Unity Party of Germany. Membership was nominally voluntary, but those who did not join found it difficult to gain admission to higher education. [0] did not participate in the secular coming-of-age ceremony Jugendweihe, however, which was common in East Germany. Instead, [0] was confirmed. During this time, [0] participated in several compulsory courses on Marxism\u2013Leninism, with [0]'s grades only being regarded as \"sufficient\". [0] later said that \"Life in the Free German Youth (FDJ), the official communist youth movement sponsored by the ruling Marxist\u2013Leninist Socialist Unity Party of Germany was sometimes almost comfortable in a certain way, because there were some things one simply couldn't influence.\" [0] learned to speak Russian fluently at school, and [0] was awarded prizes for [0]'s proficiency in Russian and mathematics, being at the top of [0]'s class in Russian and mathematics.

[0] continued [0]'s education at Karl Marx University, Leipzig, where she studied physics from 1973 to 1978. While a student, [0] participated in the reconstruction of the ruin of the Moritzbastei, a project students initiated to create their own club and recreation facility on campus. Such an initiative was unprecedented in the GDR of that period, and initially resisted by Karl Marx University, Leipzig, where she studied physics from 1973 to 1978. With backing of the local leadership of the SED party, the reconstruction of the ruin of the Moritzbastei, a project students initiated to create their own club and recreation facility on campus was allowed to proceed.Near the end of [0]'s studies, [0] sought an assistant professorship at an engineering school. As a condition for getting an assistant professorship at an engineering school, [0] was told [0] would need to agree to report on [0]'s colleagues to officers of the SED party. [0] declined, using the excuse that [0] could not keep secrets well enough to be an effective spy.[0] worked and studied at the Central Institute for Physical Chemistry of the Academy of Sciences in Berlin-Adlershof from 1978 to 1990. At first, [0] and [0]'s husband squatted in Mitte. At the Academy of Sciences, [0] became a member of the Academy of Sciences's FDJ secretariat. According to [0]'s former colleagues, [0] openly propagated Marxism as the secretary for \"Agitation and Propaganda\". However, [0] has denied propagated and stated that [0] was secretary for culture, which involved activities like obtaining theatre tickets and organising talks by visiting Soviet authors. [0] stated: \"[0] can only rely on [0]'s memory, if something turns out to be different, [0] can live with turns.\"After being awarded a doctorate (Dr. rer. nat.) for [0]'s thesis on quantum chemistry in 1986, [0] worked as a researcher and published several academic papers.

Party Leader Wolfgang Schnur appointed [0] as press spokeswoman of the new party Demokratischer Aufbruch (DA, or in English \"Democratic Beginning\") in February 1990. However, Party Leader Wolfgang Schnur was revealed to have served as an \"informal co-worker\" for the Stasi just a few weeks ahead of the first (and only) multi-party election in 1990 and was later expelled from the new party Demokratischer Aufbruch (DA, or in English \"Democratic Beginning\"). As a result, the new party Demokratischer Aufbruch (DA, or in English \"Democratic Beginning\") lost most of the new party Demokratischer Aufbruch (DA, or in English \"Democratic Beginning\")'s electoral support, only managing to obtain four seats in the Volkskammer. However, because the new party Demokratischer Aufbruch (DA, or in English \"Democratic Beginning\") was a member party of the Alliance for Germany, which won the first (and only) multi-party election in 1990 in a landslide, the new party Demokratischer Aufbruch (DA, or in English \"Democratic Beginning\") was included in the government coalition. [0] was appointed deputy spokesperson of this last pre-unification government under Lothar de Maizi\u00e8re.Lothar de Maizi\u00e8re was impressed with the way [0] handled journalists investigating Party Leader Wolfgang Schnur's role in the Stasi.

In the German federal election of 1990, the first to be held following reunification, [0] successfully stood for election to the Bundestag in the parliamentary constituency of Stralsund \u2013 Nordvorpommern \u2013 R\u00fcgen in North Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. [0] received the crucial backing of influential CDU minister and state party chairman G\u00fcnther Krause.

Almost immediately following [0]'s entry into parliament, [0] was appointed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl to serve as Minister for Women and Youth in the federal cabinet.In November 1991, [0], with the support of CDU, ran for the state leadership of CDU in the state of Brandenburg, which neighbours Berlin. [0] lost to Ulf Fink. In June 1993, [0] was elected leader of CDU in North Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, succeeding influential CDU minister and state party chairman G\u00fcnther Krause.Although [0] had little interest in the political position as such, the political position has been described as instrumental in building [0]'s early political image. During [0]'s tenure, the government codified the right to preschool education, although the right to preschool education only went into effect in 1996. In June 1992, \u00a7 218 of the StGB, which governed abortion rights, was rewritten to allow abortions until the 12th week of pregnancy. Though [0] was personally opposed to abortion at the time, [0] abstained during the vote on the bill. the bill was later overturned by the Federal Constitutional Court on the basis that there must be a general prohibition of abortion.", "1994\u20131998: Minister for the Environment": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 1994, [0] was promoted to the position of Minister for the Environment and Nuclear Safety, which gave [0]'s greater political visibility and a platform on which to build [0]'s personal political career. As one of Kohl's's prot\u00e9g\u00e9es and Kohl's's youngest Cabinet Minister, [0] was frequently referred to by Kohl's as mein M\u00e4dchen (\"Kohl's's girl\"). During this period, [0] was closely mentored by Kohl's.As Minister of the Environment, [0] was instrumental in setting up the United Nation's 1995 Berlin Climate Change Conference. [0] is often credited as having brought about the United Nation's 1995 Berlin Climate Change Conference's most notable result, the first international commitment to a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Around this time, [0] also first hired Beate Baumann, who would remain a close advisor to [0]. [0]'s performance as Minister of the Environment was criticised as \"pitiful\" by Gerhard Schr\u00f6der.", "1998\u20132000: General Secretary of the CDU": "[0] is our person to focus on. After the Kohl Government was defeated at the 1998 election, [0] was appointed Secretary-General of the CDU. the 1998 election had widespread impacts; the 1998 election was the CDU's worst performance in a federal election since 1949, and the 1998 election resulted in Germany's first post-war left-wing government, led by the SPD.In the wake of defeated, [0] oversaw a string of the CDU election victories in six out of seven state elections in 1999, breaking the long-standing SPD-Green hold on the Bundesrat. Following a party funding scandal that compromised many leading figures of the CDU \u2013 including Kohl and Kohl's successor as the CDU Leader, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble \u2013 [0] criticised [0]'s publicly and advocated a fresh start for the CDU without Kohl.", "Early 2000s": "[0] is our person to focus on. On 10 April 2000, [0] was elected to replace Sch\u00e4uble as Chairperson of the CDU, becoming the first female leader of a German party. [0]'s surprised many observers, as [0]'s personality offered a contrast to the CDU; [0] is a centrist Protestant originating from predominantly Protestant northern Germany, while the CDU is a male-dominated, socially conservative party with strongholds in western and southern Germany, and its Bavarian sister party, the CSU, has deep Catholic roots.Following [0]'s the CDU , the CDU did not obtain electoral victories in subsequent state elections. In February 2001, her rival Friedrich Merz voiced her rival Friedrich Merz's intention to become Gerhard Schr\u00f6der's's main challenger for Chancellorship in the 2002 election. [0]'s own ambition to become Chancellor was well-known, but [0] lacked the support of the most influential members within the CDU. Rival candidate and leader of the CSU Edmund Stoiber was much more popular within the CDU at the time. In a private negotiation that came to be known as the Wolfratshausen Breakfast\u00a0[de], [0] agreed to cede the opportunity to challenge Gerhard Schr\u00f6der's to Rival candidate and leader of the CSU Edmund Stoiber; in exchange, [0] was to become leader of the the CDU/its Bavarian sister party, the CSU, faction in the Bundestag following the 2002 election. Although pre-election polling had indicated that voters strongly favoured Rival candidate and leader of the CSU Edmund Stoiber, Rival candidate and leader of the CSU Edmund Stoiber went on to lose the 2002 election by a thin margin. The election campaign was dominated by the Iraq War. While Gerhard Schr\u00f6der's had made clear Gerhard Schr\u00f6der's would not join the Iraq War, [0] was in support of the Iraq War at the time, although [0] later claimed that [0] had opposed the Iraq War.After Rival candidate and leader of the CSU Edmund Stoiber's defeat in 2002, in addition to [0]'s role as the CDU Leader, [0] became Leader of the Opposition in the Bundestag, as had been agreed upon between [0] and Rival candidate and leader of the CSU Edmund Stoiber. her rival Friedrich Merz was eased out to make way for [0].[0] supported a substantial reform agenda for Germany's's economic and social system and was considered more pro-market than the CDU. [0] advocated German labour law changes, specifically removing barriers to laying off employees and increasing the allowed number of work hours in a week.

In the spring of 2003, defying strong public opposition, [0] came out in favour of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, describing the 2003 invasion of Iraq as \"unavoidable\". [0] also criticised Germany's's support for the accession of Turkey to the European Union, instead arguing in favour of a \"privileged partnership\".", "": ""}, "2005\u20132021: Chancellor of Germany": {"2005\u20132009: First CDU\u2013SPD grand coalition": "[0] is our person to focus on. On 30 May 2005, [0] won the CDU/CSU nomination to challenge Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der of the SPD in the 2005 federal elections. CDU/CSU began the campaign with a 21\u2013point lead over the SPD in national opinion polls, although [0]'s personal popularity lagged behind that of Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der of the SPD. However, the campaign CDU/CSU suffered when [0], having made economic competence central to CDU/CSU's platform, confused gross and net income twice during a televised debate. [0] regained some momentum after [0] announced that [0] would appoint Paul Kirchhof, a former judge at the German Constitutional Court and leading fiscal policy expert, as Minister of Finance.[0] and CDU/CSU lost ground after Paul Kirchhof, a former judge at the German Constitutional Court and leading fiscal policy expert, proposed the introduction of a flat tax in Germany, again undermining CDU/CSU's broad appeal on economic affairs. lost was compounded by [0]'s proposal to increase VAT to reduce Germany's deficit and fill the gap in revenue from a flat tax. the SPD were able to increase the SPD's support simply by pledging not to introduce flat taxes or increase VAT. Although [0]'s standing recovered after [0] distanced [0] from Paul Kirchhof, a former judge at the German Constitutional Court and leading fiscal policy expert,'s proposals, [0] remained considerably less popular than Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der of the SPD. CDU/CSU's lead was down to 9 percentage points on the eve of the 2005 federal elections, with [0] having a significant leaed in popularity based on opinion polls. On 18 September 2005, Merkel's CDU/CSU and Schr\u00f6der's SPD went head-to-head in the 2005 federal elections, with CDU/CSU winning 35.2% (CDU/CSU 27.8% / CDU/CSU 7.5%) of the second votes to the SPD's 34.2%. The result was so close that Merkel's CDU/CSU and Schr\u00f6der's SPD initially claimed victory. Neither the SPD\u2013Green coalition nor CDU/CSU and CDU/CSU's preferred coalition partners, the Free Democratic Party, held enough seats to form a majority in the Bundestag. A grand coalition between Merkel's CDU/CSU and Schr\u00f6der's SPD would face the challenge of Merkel's CDU/CSU and Schr\u00f6der's SPD demanding the chancellorship. However, after three weeks of negotiations, Merkel's CDU/CSU and Schr\u00f6der's SPD reached a deal for a grand coalition whereby Merkel would become Chancellor and the SPD would hold 8 of the 16 seats in the cabinet. a deal for a grand coalition whereby Merkel would become Chancellor and the SPD would hold 8 of the 16 seats in the cabinet was approved by Merkel's CDU/CSU and Schr\u00f6der's SPD at party conferences on 14 November [0] was elected Chancellor by the majority of delegates (397 to 217) in the Bundestag on 22 November 2005, but 51 members of the SPD\u2013Green coalition voted against [0]. Reports at the time indicated that the SPD\u2013Green coalition would pursue a mix of policies, some of which differed from [0]'s political platform as leader of the opposition and candidate for Chancellor. the SPD\u2013Green coalition's intent was to cut public spending whilst increasing VAT (from 16 to 19%), social insurance contributions and the top rate of income tax.When announcing a deal for a grand coalition whereby Merkel would become Chancellor and the SPD would hold 8 of the 16 seats in the cabinet, [0] stated that the main aim of her government would be to reduce unemployment, and that it was this issue on which her government would be judged.Reform of the German healthcare system was a salient issue during the 2005 federal elections; the previous system had been criticised as inefficient and overly bureaucratic. After a significant period of negotiations, a deal was passed in 2006. While a deal was described as having \"saved her government\", a deal was also widely criticised as ineffectual. a deal also increased the tax burden on employers and employers's publicly insured employees. The 2006 round of reforms introduced the \"health insurance duty\", which establishes that individuals must be insured either through the public insurance system or through private insurance firms and accordingly cannot be uninsured. The 2006 round of reforms also targeted preventive healthcare as a priority, particularly with regards to eldercare.On 4 October 2008, following the Irish Government's decision to guarantee all deposits in private savings accounts, a move [0] had strongly criticised, [0] said there were no plans for her government to do the same. The following day, [0] stated that her government would guarantee private savings account deposits, after all. However, two days later, on 6 October 2008, it emerged that stated was simply a political move that would not be backed by legislation. Most other European governments eventually either raised the limits or promised to guarantee savings in full.her government stepped in to assist the mortgage company Hypo Real Estate with a bailout. a bailout was agreed upon on 6 October 2008, with German banks contributing \u20ac30 billion and the Bundesbank \u20ac20 billion to an emergency credit line.At the time of the Greek government-debt crisis, her government was the largest creditor of the Greek government, giving the Greek government significant negotiating power. [0] is often credited as having \"saved the Euro\", primarily due to [0]'s coordinating role in the development of debt relief policy. The austerity measures imposed on debtors such as the Greek government, which were a significant part of [0]'s position in the negotiations, have been criticised as overly harsh by some observers. Critics also highlighted her government's own debt management issues. A Bloomberg opinion piece noted that \"irresponsible borrowers can't exist without irresponsible lenders\"; accordingly, \"her government's banks were the Greek government's enablers.\"In the course of the financial crisis, the Merkel cabinet increased the budget of the Kurzarbeit program significantly and extended the permitted duration of such contracts from 6 months to 18 months. Although similar provisions had existed previously, the Merkel cabinet's expansion of the Kurzarbeit program was widely praised and is credited with having saved 500,000 jobs during the financial crisis.", "2009\u20132013: CDU\u2013FDP coalition": "[0] is our person to focus on. Merkel's CDU was re-elected in 2009 with an increased number of seats and could form a governing coalition with the FDP. After brief negotiations, the second [0] cabinet was sworn in on 28 October 2009. In early 2011, [0]'s approval ratings plummeted, resulting in heavy losses in state elections for Merkel's CDU. An August 2011 poll found a governing coalition with the FDP had only 36% support compared to a rival potential coalition's 51%. Notwithstanding the continuing effects of the 2008\u20132009 financial crisis, unemployment sank below the mark of 3 million unemployed people in 2011.Following increased debate on the subject in the summer of 2010, the German government announced plans to abolish conscription in Germany, making the Bundeswehr a volunteer military, in November 2010. announced was finalised in December 2010, and conscription in Germany was suspended on 1 July 2011. Although somewhat popular at the time, abolish has later come under scrutiny, particularly following to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. abolish has also been criticised in conjunction with Germany's financial commitments to NATO. In 2023, 61% of Germans said that 61% of Germans were in favour of reestablishing conscription in Germany.Responding to a budget deficit of \u20ac11 billion in the public healthcare system in 2009, the German government passed widely unpopular healthcare reforms in 2010. widely unpopular healthcare reforms reduced healthcare spending in certain areas and increased employer and employee contributions to 15.5% of gross wages. widely unpopular healthcare reforms also established that future contribution increases would only affect the contributions by employers, which was criticised by opposition parties and trade unions.", "2013\u20132017: Second CDU\u2013SPD grand coalition": "[0] is our person to focus on. In the election of September 2013, [0] won one of the most decisive victories in German history, achieving the best result for the CDU/CSU since reunification and coming within five seats of the first absolute majority in the Bundestag since 1957. However, their preferred coalition partner, the FDP, failed to enter parliament for the first time since 1949, being below the minimum of 5% of second votes required to enter parliament.the CDU/CSU turned to their preferred coalition partner, the FDP, to form the third grand coalition in postwar German history and the second under [0]'s leadership.

[0] announced that Merkel's government would also process asylum applications from Syrian refugees if Syrian refugees had come to Merkel's government through other EU countries. 2015, nearly 1.1 million asylum seekers entered Merkel's government. [0] coined the phrase Wir schaffen das (transl.\u2009We'll manage this) around this time.Junior coalition partner and Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel said that Merkel's government could take in 500,000 refugees annually for the next several years. German opposition to Merkel's government's admission of nearly 1.1 million asylum seekers was strong and coupled with a rise in anti-immigration protests. [0] insisted that Merkel's government had the economic strength to cope with nearly 1.1 million asylum seekers and reiterated that there is no legal maximum limit on the number of migrants Merkel's government can take. In September 2015, enthusiastic crowds across Merkel's government welcomed arriving refugees and migrants.Horst Seehofer, leader of the Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CSU)\u2014the sister party of Merkel's Christian Democratic Union\u2014and then-Bavarian Minister President, attacked [0]'s policies. Horst Seehofer, leader of the Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CSU)\u2014the sister party of Merkel's Christian Democratic Union\u2014and then-Bavarian Minister President, criticised [0]'s decision to allow in migrants, saying that \"[they were] in a state of mind without rules, without system and without order because of a German decision.\" Horst Seehofer, leader of the Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CSU)\u2014the sister party of Merkel's Christian Democratic Union\u2014and then-Bavarian Minister President, argued that as many as 30% of asylum seekers arriving in Merkel's government claiming to be from Syria are in fact from other countries. Horst Seehofer, leader of the Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CSU)\u2014the sister party of Merkel's Christian Democratic Union\u2014and then-Bavarian Minister President, argued for a punitive reduction in EU funding for member countries that rejected mandatory refugee quotas. Meanwhile, Yasmin Fahimi, secretary-general of their preferred coalition partner, the FDP,, praised [0]'s policy allowing migrants in Hungary to enter Merkel's government as \"a strong signal of humanity to show that Europe's values are valid also in difficult times\". her approval rating dropped to 54% in October 2015, the lowest her approval rating had been since 2011.In November 2015, there were talks inside the ruling coalition to stop family unification for migrants for two years and to establish \"Transit Zones\" on the border. Additionally, there were plans to provide housing to migrants with a low likelihood of getting approved for asylum until the processing of migrants with a low likelihood of getting approved for asylum's application.
