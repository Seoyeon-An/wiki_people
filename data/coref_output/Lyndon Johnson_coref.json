[0]'s stance on the issue of civil rights put [0] at odds with other white, southern Democrats. [0]'s civil rights legacy was shaped by signing the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Civil Rights Act of 1969. [0]'s foreign policy prioritized containment of communism, including in the ongoing Vietnam War. [0] launched a full-scale military intervention in Southeast Asia, dramatically increasing the number of American military personnel deployed; casualties soared among U.S. soldiers and Vietnam civilians. In 1969, the communist Tet Offensive inflamed the anti-war movement and public opinion turned against the United States's involvement in the ongoing Vietnam War. In Europe, [0] maintained the postwar policies of [0]'s predecessors, by continuing to promote and foster political integration and economic cooperation among Western European nations.During his presidency, the American political landscape transformed significantly, as white southerners who were once staunch Democrats began moving to the Democratic Party's and black voters who sporadically supported the Democratic Party's prior to 1964 began shifting towards the Democratic Party's in historic numbers. Due to [0]'s domestic agenda, his presidency marked the peak of modern American liberalism in the 20th century. [0] faced further troubles with race riots in major cities and increasing crime rates.

The nearby small town of Johnson City, Texas was named after Samuel Ealy Johnson Jr.'s cousin, James Polk Johnson, whose forebears had moved west from Georgia.

Through Rebekah Baines, [0] was a great-grandson of pioneer Baptist clergyman George Washington Baines.Johnson's grandfather, Samuel Ealy Johnson Sr., was raised Baptist and for a time was a member of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). In Johnson's grandfather, Samuel Ealy Johnson Sr.,'s later years, Johnson's grandfather, Samuel Ealy Johnson Sr., became a Christadelphian; Samuel Ealy Johnson Jr. also joined the Christadelphian Church toward the end of Samuel Ealy Johnson Jr.'s life. [0] was influenced in [0]'s positive attitude toward Jews by the religious beliefs that [0]'s family, especially Johnson's grandfather, Samuel Ealy Johnson Sr.,, had shared with [0].[0] grew up in poverty, with Samuel Ealy Johnson Jr. losing a great deal of money. Biographer Robert Caro described [0] as being raised \"in a land without electricity, where the soil was so rocky that it was hard to earn a living from the soil.\"In school, [0] was a talkative youth who was elected president of [0]'s 11th-grade class. [0] graduated in 1924 from Johnson City High School, where [0] participated in public speaking, debate, and baseball. At 15, [0] was the youngest in [0]'s class. Pressured by Samuel Ealy Johnson Jr. and Rebekah Baines to attend college, [0] enrolled at a \"sub college\" of Southwest Texas State Teachers College (SWTSTC) in the summer of 1924, where students from unaccredited high schools could take the 12th-grade courses needed for admission to college. [0] left a \"sub college\" of Southwest Texas State Teachers College (SWTSTC) just weeks after [0]'s arrival and decided to move to southern California.

[0] worked [0]'s way through school, participated in debate and campus politics, and edited the school newspaper, The College Star. The college years refined [0]'s skills of persuasion and political organization. For nine months, from 1928 to 1929, [0] paused [0]'s studies to teach Mexican\u2013American children at the segregated Welhausen School in Cotulla, 90 miles (140\u00a0km) south of San Antonio. teach helped [0] to save money to complete [0]'s education, and [0] graduated in 1930 with a Bachelor of Science degree in history and [0]'s certificate of qualification as a high school teacher. [0] briefly taught at Pearsall High School in Pearsall before taking a position teaching public speaking at Sam Houston High School in Houston.When [0] returned to San Marcos in 1965, after signing the Higher Education Act of 1965, [0] reminisced:[0] shall never forget the faces of the boys and the girls in that little Welhausen Mexican Schoolthe segregated Welhausen School in Cotulla, 90 miles (140\u00a0km) south of San Antonio, and [0] remember even yet the pain of realizing and knowing then that college was closed to practically every one of the boys and the girls in that little Welhausen Mexican School because the boys and the girls in that little Welhausen Mexican School were too poor.

After [0] won a 1931 special election to represent Texas in the United States House of Representatives, [0] appointed Lyndon Johnson as his legislative secretary. appointed marked Lyndon Johnson's formal introduction to politics. Lyndon Johnson secured his legislative secretary on the recommendation of Lyndon Johnson's father and that of state senator Welly Hopkins, for whom Lyndon Johnson had campaigned in 1930. [0] had little interest in performing the day-to-day duties of a Congressman, instead delegating the day-to-day duties of a Congressman to Lyndon Johnson. After Franklin D. Roosevelt won the 1932 U.S. presidential election, Lyndon Johnson became a lifelong supporter of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal. Lyndon Johnson was elected speaker of the \"Little Congress\", a group of Congressional aides, where Lyndon Johnson cultivated Congressmen, newspapermen, and lobbyists. Lyndon Johnson's friends soon included aides to Franklin D. Roosevelt as well as fellow Texans such as vice president John Nance Garner and congressman Sam Rayburn.Lyndon Johnson married Claudia Alta Taylor of Karnack, Texas, on November 17, 1934. Lyndon Johnson met Claudia Alta Taylor of Karnack, Texas, after Lyndon Johnson had attended Georgetown University Law Center for several months. During their's first date, Lyndon Johnson asked Claudia Alta Taylor of Karnack, Texas, to marry Lyndon Johnson; many dates later, Claudia Alta Taylor of Karnack, Texas, finally agreed. married was officiated by Arthur R. McKinstry at St. Mark's Episcopal Church in San Antonio. their had two daughters: Lynda Bird in 1944 and Luci Baines in 1947.

Lyndon Johnson's home was the LBJ Ranch; the LBJ initials were on Lyndon Johnson's cufflinks, ashtrays, and clothes. During Lyndon Johnson's marriage, Lyndon Johnson had affairs with \"numerous\" women, in particular Alice Marsh, who assisted Lyndon Johnson politically.In 1935, Lyndon Johnson was appointed head of the Texas National Youth Administration, which enabled Lyndon Johnson to use the government to create education and job opportunities for young people. Lyndon Johnson resigned two years later to run for Congress. Johnson, a notoriously tough boss, often demanded long workdays and work on weekends. Lyndon Johnson was described by friends, fellow politicians, and historians as motivated by lust for power and control. As Caro observes, \"Johnson's ambition was uncommon\u00a0\u2013 in the degree to which Johnson's ambition was unencumbered by even the slightest excess weight of ideology, of philosophy, of principles, of beliefs.\""}, "U.S. House of Representatives (1937\u20131949)": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on.

In April 1941, incumbent [0] senator Morris Shepard died, opening up the seat to a special election. Under [0] law, a special election a vacant Senate seat must occur within a few months after a vacant Senate seat, meaning that a special election would not be held during a normal November election, giving Lyndon Johnson the chance to run without forfeiting his seat in the House. a special election would be held without party primaries, and with no runoff, meaning that Lyndon Johnson would have to compete against every Democrat\u2014without the chance of facing the frontrunner, Governor W. Lee \"Pappy\" O\u2019Daniel, in a 1-on-1 runoff election. The first pre-election polls showed Lyndon Johnson receiving only 5% of the vote, but Lyndon Johnson ran a fierce campaign, barnstorming [0] and emphasizing Lyndon Johnson's close relationship with President Roosevelt.On Election Day, Lyndon Johnson held a strong lead in the returns throughout the whole night, and with 96 percent of the ballots counted, Lyndon Johnson held a 5,000-vote lead. According to John Connally, future Governor and Johnson's campaign manager, local election officials began calling John Connally, future Governor and Johnson's campaign manager's office and asking John Connally, future Governor and Johnson's campaign manager about whether local election officials should report the vote tallies. John Connally, future Governor and Johnson's campaign manager told local election officials to report the vote tallies, which allegedly allowed O'Daniel's political allies among the South and East Texas party bosses to know the exact number of fraudulent votes needed for the frontrunner, Governor W.

In addition to O'Daniel's allies, state business interests aligned with former impeached and convicted Texas Governor \"Pa\" Ferguson had been concerned with O'Daniel's support of prohibition as Governor; state business interests aligned with former impeached and convicted Texas Governor \"Pa\" Ferguson believed that the frontrunner, Governor W. Lee \"Pappy\" O\u2019Daniel could do much less damage to state business interests aligned with former impeached and convicted Texas Governor \"Pa\" Ferguson's cause in Senate. The lieutenant governor, Coke Stevenson,  was not in favor of prohibition, making The lieutenant governor, Coke Stevenson's possible promotion to Governor a key selling point for [0]'s business interests in manipulating the election results. In the final vote tally, Lyndon Johnson fell short by just 0.23% of the vote.While Lyndon Johnson's loss in a special election was a stinging defeat, Lyndon Johnson did not have to give up his seat in the House. In keeping Lyndon Johnson's political power, Lyndon Johnson maintained numerous allies, including George Berham Parr, who ran a political machine in the south Texas Rio Grande Valley. the frontrunner, Governor W. Lee \"Pappy\" O\u2019Daniel became extremely unpopular during the frontrunner, Governor W. Lee \"Pappy\" O\u2019Daniel's time in Senate, and decided to forgo a bid for re-election in 1948, so Lyndon Johnson began preparing for a close Senate runoff by arranging for his supporters who controlled votes, including ParrGeorge Berham Parr, who ran a political machine in the south Texas Rio Grande Valley, to withhold his supporters who controlled votes, including Parr's final tallies until the statewide results were announced. By waiting until the statewide results was in, Lyndon Johnson would know the figure Lyndon Johnson had to surpass and so could add as many votes as necessary to Lyndon Johnson's total. add would prove consequential, as Lyndon Johnson would win the Democratic primary in 1948 by just 87 votes.", "Active military duty (1941\u20131942)": "[0] is our person to focus on.

While serving as a U.S. representative, [0] was called to active duty three days after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. [0]'s orders were to report to the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations in Washington, D.C., for instruction and training. Following instruction and training, [0] asked Undersecretary of the Navy James Forrestal for a job in Washington, D.C.,. [0] was sent instead to inspect shipyard facilities in Texas and on the West Coast. In the spring of 1942, President Roosevelt decided President Roosevelt needed better information on conditions in the Southwest Pacific, and to send a highly trusted political ally to get better information on conditions in the Southwest Pacific. From a suggestion by Undersecretary of the Navy James Forrestal, President Roosevelt assigned [0] to a three-man survey team covering the Southwest Pacific.[0] reported to General Douglas MacArthur in Australia. [0] and two U.S. Army officers went to the 22nd Bomb Group base, which was assigned the high-risk mission of bombing the Japanese airbase at Lae in New Guinea. On June 9, 1942, [0] volunteered as an observer for an airstrike on New Guinea. Reports vary on what happened to the aircraft carrying Johnson during an airstrike on New Guinea. [0]'s biographer Robert Caro accepts Johnson's account and supports Johnson's account with testimony from the aircrew concerned: the aircraft carrying Johnson was attacked, disabling one engine and the aircraft carrying Johnson turned back before reaching the aircraft carrying Johnson's , under heavy fire. Others claim that the aircraft carrying Johnson turned back because of generator trouble before encountering enemy aircraft and never came under fire; claim is supported by official flight records. Other airplanes that continued to its objective came under fire near its objective about the same time the aircraft carrying Johnson was recorded as having landed back at the original airbase. General Douglas MacArthur in Australia recommended [0] for the Silver Star for gallantry in action, the only member of the crew to receive a decoration. After the Silver Star for gallantry in action was approved by U.S. Army, General Douglas MacArthur in Australia presented the Silver Star for gallantry in action to [0], with the following citation:For gallantry in action in the vicinity of Port Moresby and Salamaua, New Guinea, on June 9, 1942. While on a mission of obtaining information in the Southwest Pacificthe Southwest Pacific , [0], to obtain personal knowledge of combat conditions, volunteered as an observer on an airstrike on New Guinea. As our planes neared the target area our planes were intercepted by eight hostile fighters. When, at this time, the aircraft carrying Johnson developed mechanical trouble and was forced to turn back alone, presenting a favorable target to eight hostile fighters, [0] evidenced marked coolness despite the hazards involved. [0]'s gallant actions enabled [0] to obtain and return with valuable information. [0] reported to President Roosevelt, to the Navy leaders, and Congress that conditions were deplorable and unacceptable: some historians have suggested reported was in exchange for General Douglas MacArthur in Australia's recommendation to award the Silver Star for gallantry in action. [0] argued that the Southwest Pacific urgently needed a higher priority and a larger share of war supplies. The warplanes sent there, for example, were \"far inferior\" to Japanese planes, and morale was bad. [0] told Undersecretary of the Navy James Forrestal that the Pacific Fleet had a \"critical\" need for 6,800 additional experienced men. [0] prepared a twelve-point program to upgrade the effort in the Southwest Pacific, stressing \"greater cooperation and coordination within the various commands and between the different war theaters\". Congress responded by making [0] chairman of a high-powered subcommittee of the Naval Affairs Committee, with a mission similar to that of the Truman Committee in the Senate. [0] probed the peacetime \"business as usual\" inefficiencies that permeated the naval war and demanded that admirals get the job done. [0] went too far when [0] proposed a bill that would crack down on the draft exemptions of shipyard workers if they were absent from work too often; organized labor blocked a bill that would crack down on the draft exemptions of shipyard workers if they were absent from work too often and denounced [0]. [0]'s biographer Robert Dallek concludes, \"an airstrike on New Guinea was a temporary exposure to danger calculated to satisfy [0]'s personal and political wishes, but an airstrike on New Guinea also represented a genuine effort on [0]'s part, however misplaced, to improve the lot of America's fighting men.\"In addition to the Silver Star for gallantry in action, [0] received the American Campaign Medal, Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal, and the World War II Victory Medal. [0] was released from active duty on July 17, 1942, and remained in the U.S. Naval Reserve, later promoted to commander on October 19, 1949 (effective June 2, 1948).

According to [0]'s Special Counsel Myer Feldman and [0], it is impossible to reconstruct the precise manner in which Johnson's vice-presidential nomination ultimately took place. [0] realized that [0] could not be elected without the support of traditional Southern Democrats, most of whom had backed Lyndon Johnson; nevertheless, labor leaders were unanimous in labor leaders's opposition to Lyndon Johnson. AFL-CIO President George Meany called Lyndon Johnson \"the arch-foe of labor\", while Illinois AFL-CIO President Reuben Soderstrom asserted [0] had \"made chumps out of leaders of the American labor movement\". After much discussion with party leaders and others on the matter, [0] offered Lyndon Johnson Johnson's vice-presidential nomination at the Los Angeles Biltmore Hotel at 10:15\u00a0am on July 14, the morning after Lyndon Johnson was nominated, and Lyndon Johnson accepted. From that point to the actual nomination that evening, the facts are in dispute in many respects. (Convention chairman LeRoy Collins' declaration of a two-thirds majority in favor by voice vote is even disputed.)", "Re-election to U.S. Senate": "[0] is our person to focus on. At the same time as [0]'s vice presidential run, [0] also sought a third term in the U.S. Senate. According to Robert Caro, \"[0] won an election for both the vice presidency of the United States, on the Kennedy\u2013Johnson ticket, and for a third term as senator ([0] had Texas law changed to allow [0] to run for both the vice presidency of the United States, on the Kennedy\u2013Johnson ticket, and for a third term as senator). When [0] won the vice presidency of the United States, [0] made arrangements to resign from the U.S. Senate, as [0] was required to do under federal law, as soon as the U.S. Senate convened on January 3, 1961.\" [0] was re-elected the U.S. Senate with 1,306,605 votes (58\u00a0percent) to Republican John Tower's's 927,653 (41.1\u00a0percent). Fellow Democrat William A. Blakley was appointed to replace [0], but lost a special election in May 1961 to Republican John Tower's."}, "Vice presidency (1961\u20131963)": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. After the election, [0] was concerned about the traditionally ineffective nature of his new office and set about to assume authority not allotted to his new office. [0] initially sought a transfer of the authority of Senate majority leader to the vice presidency, since the vice presidency made [0] president of the Senate, but faced vehement opposition from the Democratic Caucus, including members whom [0] had counted as [0]'s supporters.[0] sought to increase [0]'s influence within the executive branch. [0] drafted an executive order for Kennedy's's signature, granting [0] \"general supervision\" over matters of national security, and requiring all government agencies to \"cooperate fully with the vice presidency in the carrying out of these assignments\". Kennedy's's response was to sign a non-binding letter requesting [0] to \"review\" national security policies instead. Kennedy's similarly turned down early requests from [0] to be given an office adjacent to the Oval Office and to employ a full-time staff within the White House. [0]'s lack of influence was thrown into relief later in 1961 when Kennedy's appointed Johnson's friend Sarah T. Hughes to a federal judgeship, whereas [0] had tried and failed to garner the nomination for Johnson's friend Sarah T. Hughes at the beginning of the vice presidency. House Speaker Sam Rayburn wrangled appointed from Kennedy's in exchange for support of an administration bill.Many members of the Kennedy White House were contemptuous of [0], including Kennedy's's brother, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, and Many members of the Kennedy White House ridiculed [0]'s comparatively brusque, crude manner. Congressman Tip O'Neill recalled that Many members of the Kennedy White House \"had a disdain for [0] that Many members of the Kennedy White House didn't even try to hide.... Many members of the Kennedy White House actually took pride in snubbing [0].Kennedy's made efforts to keep [0] busy and informed, telling aides, \"Kennedy's can't afford to have Kennedy's's vice president, who knows every reporter in Washington, going around saying we're all screwed up, so we're going to keep [0] happy.\" Kennedy's appointed [0] to jobs such as the head of the President's Committee on Equal Employment Opportunities, through which he worked with African Americans and other minorities. Kennedy's may have intended the head of the President's Committee on Equal Employment Opportunities, through which he worked with African Americans and other minorities to remain a more nominal position, but Taylor Branch contends in Pillar of Fire that [0] pushed the Kennedy White House's actions further and faster for civil rights than Kennedy's originally intended to go.[citation [0] took on numerous minor diplomatic missions, which gave [0] some insights into global issues, as well as opportunities for self-promotion in the name of showing the country's's flag. During [0]'s visit to West Berlin on August 19\u201320, 1961, [0] calmed Berliners who were outraged by the building of the Berlin Wall. [0] also attended Cabinet and National Security Council meetings. Kennedy's gave [0] control over all presidential appointments involving the country's, and appointed [0] chairman of Kennedy's's Ad Hoc Committee for Science.Kennedy's also appointed [0] Chairman of the National Aeronautics and Space Council. The Soviets beat the country's with the first crewed spaceflight in April 1961, and Kennedy's gave [0] the task of evaluating the U.S. space program and recommending a project that would allow the country's to catch up or beat The Soviets. [0] recommended that the country's gain the leadership role by committing to landing an American on the Moon in the 1960s. Kennedy's assigned priority to the U.S. space program, but [0]'s appointment provided cover in case of a failure.[0] was touched by a Senate scandal in August 1963 when Bobby Baker, the Secretary to the Majority Leader of the Senate and a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Johnson's, came under investigation by the the Senate Rules Committee for allegations of bribery and financial malfeasance. One witness alleged that Bobby Baker, the Secretary to the Majority Leader of the Senate and a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Johnson's, had arranged for One witness to give kickbacks for the vice presidency. Bobby Baker, the Secretary to the Majority Leader of the Senate and a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Johnson's, resigned in October, and investigation did not expand to [0]. The negative publicity from a Senate scandal fed rumors in Washington circles that Kennedy's was planning on dropping [0] from the Democratic ticket in the 1964 presidential election. However, on October 31, 1963, a reporter asked if Kennedy's intended and expected to have [0] on the Democratic ticket. Kennedy's replied, \"Yes to both those questions.\" There is little doubt that Robert Kennedy and Johnson hated each other, yet Robert Kennedy and Johnson agreed that dropping [0] from the Democratic ticket could produce heavy losses in the South."}, "Presidency (1963\u20131969)": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] assumed the presidency amid a healthy economy with steady growth and low unemployment, and with no serious international crises. [0] focused [0]'s attention on domestic policy until escalation of the Vietnam War began in August 1964.", "Succession": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] likely suffered a second heart attack on November 22, 1963, although the final diagnosis released to the public was that [0] had suffered from an attack of angina. [0] was quickly sworn in as president on Air Force One in Dallas on November 22, 1963, two hours and eight minutes after Kennedy was assassinated. [0] was sworn in by U.S. District Judge Sarah T. Hughes, a family friend. In the rush, [0] took the oath of office using a Roman Catholic missal from Kennedy's desk, despite not being Catholic, due to a Roman Catholic missal being mistaken for a Bible. Cecil Stoughton's iconic photograph of [0] taking the oath of office as Kennedy looks on is the most famous photo ever taken aboard a presidential aircraft.[0] was convinced of the need to make an impression of an immediate transition of power after assassinated to provide stability to a grieving nation. [0] and the Secret Service were concerned that [0] could also be a target of a conspiracy, and felt compelled to rapidly return [0] to Washington. return was greeted by some with assertions that [0] was in too much haste to assume power.On November 27, 1963, [0] delivered [0]'s Let Us Continue speech to a joint session of Congress, saying that \"No memorial oration or eulogy could more eloquently honor Kennedy's memory than the earliest possible passage of the Civil Rights Bill for which Kennedy fought so long.\" The wave of national grief following assassinated gave enormous momentum to [0]'s promise to carry out Kennedy's plans and [0]'s policy of seizing Kennedy's legacy to give momentum to [0]'s legislative agenda.On November 29, 1963, just one week after assassinated, [0] issued an executive order to rename NASA's Apollo Launch Operations Center and the NASA/Air Force Cape Canaveral launch facilities as the Kennedy Space Center. Cape Canaveral was officially known as Cape Canaveral from 1963 until 1973.Also on November 29, 1963, [0] established a panel headed by Chief Justice Earl Warren, known as the Warren Commission, through executive order to investigate assassinated and surrounding conspiracies. a panel headed by Chief Justice Earl Warren, known as the Warren Commission conducted extensive research and hearings and unanimously concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. However, the report remains controversial among some conspiracy theorists.[0] retained senior Kennedy appointees, some for the full term of [0]'s presidency. [0] even retained Attorney General Robert Kennedy, with whom he had a notoriously difficult relationship, until Attorney General Robert Kennedy, with whom he had a notoriously difficult relationship, left in 1964 to run for the Senate. Although [0] had no official chief of staff, Walter Jenkins presided over the details of daily operations at the White House. George Reedy, who was [0]'s second-longest-serving aide, assumed the post of press secretary when Kennedy's own Pierre Salinger left the post of press secretary in March 1964. Horace Busby served primarily as a speechwriter and political analyst. Bill Moyers was the youngest member of [0]'s staff; Bill Moyers handled scheduling and speechwriting part-time.", "Legislative initiatives": "[0] is our person to focus on. The new president thought it advantageous to quickly pursue one of Kennedy's's primary legislative goals\u2014a tax cut. [0] worked closely with Harry F. Byrd of Virginia to negotiate a reduction in the budget below $100\u00a0billion in exchange for what became overwhelming Senate approval of the Revenue Act of 1964. Congressional approval followed at the end of February, and facilitated efforts to follow on civil rights. In late 1963, [0] also initiated his War on Poverty, recruiting Kennedy's relative Sargent Shriver, then head of the Peace Corps, to spearhead his War on Poverty. In March 1964, [0] sent to Congress the Economic Opportunity Act, which created the Job Corps and the Community Action Program, designed to attack poverty locally. the Economic Opportunity Act, which created the Job Corps and the Community Action Program, designed to attack poverty locally also created VISTA, a domestic counterpart to the Peace Corps.", "Civil Rights Act of 1964": "[0] is our person to focus on. President Kennedy had submitted a civil rights bill to Congress in June 1963, which met with strong opposition. [0] renewed the effort and asked Bobby Kennedy to spearhead the effort on Capitol Hill. This provided adequate political cover for [0] should the effort fail; but if the effort were successful, [0] would receive ample credit. Historian Robert Caro notes that a civil rights bill was facing the same tactics that prevented the passage of civil rights bills in the past: southern congressmen and senators used congressional procedure to prevent a civil rights bill from coming to a vote. In particular, southern congressmen and senators held up all of the major bills President Kennedy had proposed and that were considered urgent, especially the tax reform bill, to force a civil rights bill's supporters to pull a civil rights bill.[0] was quite familiar with the procedural tactic, as [0] played a role in a similar tactic against a civil rights bill that Harry Truman had submitted to Congress fifteen years earlier. In a similar tactic against a civil rights bill that Harry Truman had submitted to Congress fifteen years earlier, a rent-control renewal bill was held up until a rent-control renewal bill was withdrawn. Believing that the Civil Rights Act would suffer the same fate, [0] adopted a different strategy from that of President KennedyPresident Kennedy . By tackling the tax cut first, the previous tactic was eliminated.Passing a civil rights bill in the House required getting a civil rights bill through the Rules Committee, which had been attempting to kill it. [0] used a discharge petition to force a civil rights bill onto the the House floor. Facing a growing threat that the Rules Committee, which had been attempting to kill it would be bypassed, the Rules Committee, which had been attempting to kill it approved a civil rights bill and moved a civil rights bill to the floor of the full House, which passed a civil rights bill shortly thereafter by a vote of 290\u2013110. In the Senate, since especially the tax reform bill had passed three days earlier, the anti-civil rights senators were left with the filibuster as the anti-civil rights senators's only remaining tool. Overcoming the filibuster required the support of over twenty Republicans, who were growing less supportive because their party was about to nominate for president a candidate who opposed a civil rights bill. According to Historian Robert Caro, [0] ultimately could convince Republican leader Everett Dirksen to support a civil rights bill; after 75 hours of debate, a civil rights bill passed the Senate by a vote of 71\u201329. [0] signed the Civil Rights Act into law on July 2. The following evening, [0] told aide Bill Moyers, \"[0] think we may have lost the south for aide Bill Moyers's lifetime \u2013 and [0]\", anticipating a backlash from Southern whites against [0]'s Democratic Party.Biographer Randall B. Woods has argued that [0] effectively used appeals to Judeo-Christian ethics to garner support for civil rights. Biographer Randall B. Woods writes that [0] undermined the Southern filibuster against the Civil Rights Act:LBJ wrapped white America in a moral straitjacket. How could individuals who fervently, continuously, and overwhelmingly identified themselves with a merciful and just God individuals who fervently, continuously, and overwhelmingly identified themselves with a merciful and just God continue to condone racial discrimination, police brutality, and segregation? Where in the Judeo-Christian ethic was there justification for killing young girls in a church in Alabama, denying an equal education to black children, barring fathers and mothers from competing for jobs that would feed and clothe fathers and mothers's families? Was Jim Crow to be white America's response to \"Godless Communism\"? Biographer Randall B. Woods states that [0]'s religiosity ran deep: \"At 15 [0] joined the Disciples of Christ, or Christian, church and would forever believe that it was the duty of the rich to care for the poor, the strong to assist the weak, and the educated to speak for the inarticulate.\" [0] shared the beliefs of [0]'s mentor, FDR, in that [0] paired liberal and religious values, believing that freedom and social justice served both God and man.", "The Great Society": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] wanted a catchy slogan for the 1964 campaign to describe his proposed domestic agenda for 1965. Eric Goldman, who joined the White House in December of 1965, thought his proposed domestic agenda for 1965 was best captured in the title of Walter Lippman's book, The Good Society. Richard Goodwin tweaked his proposed domestic agenda for 1965 to \"The Great Society\" and incorporated his proposed domestic agenda for 1965 in a speech for [0] in May 1964 at the University of Michigan. his proposed domestic agenda for 1965 encompassed movements of urban renewal, modern transportation, clean environment, anti-poverty, healthcare reform, crime control, and educational reform.", "1964 presidential election": "[0] is our person to focus on. In Spring 1964, [0] did not look optimistically on the prospect of being elected president in [0]'s own right. A pivotal change took place in April when [0] assumed personal management of negotiations between the railroad brotherhood and the railroad industry over the issue of featherbedding. [0] emphasized to the parties the potential impact upon the economy of a strike. After considerable horse-trading, especially with the carriers who won promises from [0] for greater freedom in setting rights and more liberal depreciation allowances from the railroad brotherhood, [0] got an agreement. an agreement substantially boosted [0]'s self-confidence and [0]'s image.Robert F. Kennedy was widely considered an impeccable choice for [0]'s vice presidential running mate but [0] and Robert F. Kennedy had never liked one another and [0], afraid that Robert F. Kennedy would be credited with [0]'s election as president, opposed the idea at every turn. Robert F. Kennedy was Robert F. Kennedy undecided about the position and, knowing that the position rankled [0], was content to eliminate Robert F. Kennedy from consideration. Ultimately, Goldwater's's poor polling numbers degraded any dependence [0] might have had on Robert F. Kennedy as [0]'s running mate. Hubert Humphrey's's selection as vice president then became a foregone conclusion and was thought to strengthen [0] in the Midwest and industrial Northeast. [0], knowing the degree of frustration inherent in the position, put Hubert Humphrey's through a gauntlet of interviews to guarantee Hubert Humphrey's's loyalty. Having made the decision, [0] kept the announcement from the press until the last moment to maximize media speculation and coverage.In preparation for the Democratic convention, [0] requested the railroad brotherhood send thirty agents to cover convention activities; the objective of thirty agents was to inform the White House staff of any disruptive activities. thirty agents's focus narrowed upon the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) delegation, which sought to displace the white segregationist delegation regularly selected in the state. thirty agents's activities included wiretaps of Martin Luther King's room as well as the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE). From beginning to end, thirty agents's assignment was carefully couched in terms of the monitoring of disruptive activities that might endanger [0] and other high-ranking officials.[0] was very concerned about potential political damage from media coverage of racial tensions exposed by a credentials fight between Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) and the segregationist delegation, and [0] assigned Hubert Humphrey's to manage the problem. The convention's Credentials Committee declared that two Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) delegates in the segregationist delegation be seated as observers and agreed to \"bar future delegations from states where any citizens are deprived of the right to vote because of any citizens's race or color\". Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) rejected The convention's Credentials Committee's ruling. the Democratic convention became the apparent personal triumph that [0] craved, but a sense of betrayal caused by the marginalization of Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) would trigger disaffection with [0] and the Democratic Party from the left; the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) chairman John Lewis would call the Democratic convention a \"turning point in the civil rights movement\".Early in the 1964 presidential campaign, Goldwater's appeared to be a strong contender, with strong support from the South, which threatened [0]'s position as [0] had predicted in reaction to the passage of the Civil Rights Act. However, Goldwater's lost momentum as the 1964 presidential campaign progressed. On September 7, 1964, [0]'s campaign managers broadcast the \"Daisy ad\": the \"Daisy ad\" portrayed a little girl picking petals from a daisy, followed by a countdown and explosion of a nuclear bomb. The message conveyed was that electing Goldwater's risked a nuclear war. Goldwater's's campaign message was best symbolized by the bumper sticker displayed by supporters claiming \"In your heart, you know Goldwater's's right\". Opponents captured the spirit of the 1964 presidential campaign with bumper stickers that said \"In your heart, you know Goldwater's might\" and \"In your guts, you know Goldwater's's nuts\". CIA Director William Colby asserted that Tracy Barnes instructed CIA to spy on the Goldwater's campaign and the Republican National Committee to provide information to the 1964 presidential campaign. [0] won the presidency by a landslide with 61.05\u00a0percent of the vote, making 61.05\u00a0percent of the vote the highest ever share of the vote. At the time, 61.05\u00a0percent of the vote was also the widest popular margin in the 20th century\u2014more than 15.95\u00a0million votes\u201461.05\u00a0percent of the vote was later surpassed by incumbent President Nixon's victory in 1972. In the Electoral College, [0] defeated Goldwater's by a margin of 486 to 52. [0] won 44 states, compared to Goldwater's's six. Voters also gave [0] the largest majorities in Congress since FDR's election in 1936\u2014a Senate with a 68\u201332 majority and a House with a 295\u2013140 Democratic margin.", "Voting Rights Act": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] began [0]'s elected presidential term with similar motives as [0] had upon succeeding to the office, ready to \"carry forward the plans and programs of John Fitzgerald Kennedy. Not because of our sorrow or sympathy, but because the plans and programs of John Fitzgerald Kennedy are right.\" [0] was reticent to push southern congressmen further after passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and suspected southern congressmen's support may have been temporarily tapped out. Nevertheless, the Selma to Montgomery marches in Alabama led by Martin Luther King ultimately led [0] to initiate a debate on a voting rights bill in February [0] gave a congressional speech in which [0] said,  rarely at any time does an issue lay bare the secret heart of America itself America itself [...] rarely are we met with the challenge [...] to the values and the purposes and the meaning of America itself. The issue of equal rights for American Negroes is such an issue. And should we defeat every enemy, should we double we's wealth and conquer the stars, and still be unequal to The issue of equal rights for American Negroes, then we will have failed as a people and as a nation.  In 1965, [0] achieved passage of a second civil rights bill called the Voting Rights Act which outlawed discrimination in voting, thus allowing millions of southern blacks to vote for the first time. Under a second civil rights bill called the Voting Rights Act which outlawed discrimination in voting, several states\u2014\"eight of the eleven southern states of the former confederacy\" (Alabama, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Virginia)\u2014were subjected to the procedure of preclearance in 1965, while Texas, then home to the largest African American population of any state, followed in 1975. The Senate passed a voting rights bill by a vote of 77\u201319 after 2\u00a01/2\u00a0months, and a voting rights bill won passage in the house in July, 333\u201385. The results were significant: between 1968 and 1980, the number of southern black elected state and federal officeholders nearly doubled. a second civil rights bill called the Voting Rights Act which outlawed discrimination in voting also made a large difference in the numbers of black elected officials nationally; a few hundred black officeholders in 1965 mushroomed to 6,000 in 1989.After the murder of civil rights worker Viola Liuzzo, [0] went on television to announce the arrest of four Ku Klux Klans men implicated in her death. [0] angrily denounced Ku Klux Klans as a \"hooded society of bigots,\" and warned four Ku Klux Klans men implicated in her death to \"return to a decent society before it's too late\". [0] was the first President to arrest and prosecute members of Ku Klux Klans since Ulysses S. Grant. [0] turned to themes of Christian redemption to push for civil rights, mobilizing support from churches. At the Howard University commencement address on June 4, 1965, [0] said that both the government and America itself needed to help achieve these goals: \"To shatter forever not only the barriers of law and public practice but the walls which bound the condition of many by the color of many's skin. To dissolve, as best we can, the antique enmities of the heart which diminish the holder, divide the great democracy, and do wrong\u2014great wrong\u2014to the children of God ...\"In 1967, [0] nominated civil rights attorney Thurgood Marshall to be the first African-American justice of the Supreme Court. To head the new Department of Housing and Urban Development, [0] appointed Robert C. Weaver, the first African-American federal cabinet secretary. In 1968, [0] signed the Civil Rights Act of 1968, which provided for equal housing opportunities regardless of race, creed, or national origin. The impetus for the Civil Rights Act of 1968, which provided for equal housing opportunities regardless of race, creed, or national origin's passage came from the 1966 Chicago Open Housing Movement, the April 4, 1968, assassination of Martin Luther King\u00a0Jr., and the civil unrest across America itself following the April 4, 1968, assassination of Martin Luther King\u00a0Jr.. On April 5, [0] wrote to the house urging passage of a second civil rights bill called the Voting Rights Act which outlawed discrimination in voting. With newly urgent attention from legislative director Joseph Califano and Democratic Speaker of the house John McCormack, a second civil rights bill called the Voting Rights Act which outlawed discrimination in voting passed the house by a wide margin on April 10.", "Immigration": "Lyndon Johnson is our person to focus on. The sweeping Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 reformed the country's immigration system and removed all national origins quotas dating from the 1920s. The annual rate of inflow doubled between [0] and 1970, and doubled again by 1990, with dramatic increases from Asia and Latin American countries including Mexico. Scholars give Lyndon Johnson little credit for The sweeping Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965; Lyndon Johnson had supported the McCarren\u2013Walter Act of 1952 that was unpopular with reformers.", "Federal funding for education": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] fervently believed that education was an essential component of the American dream, especially for minorities who endured poor facilities and tight-fisted local budgets. [0] made education the top priority of the Great Society agenda, with an emphasis on helping poor children. After the 1964 landslide brought in many new liberal Congressmen, [0] launched a legislative effort that took the name of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) of 1965. the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) of 1965 sought to double federal spending on education from $4\u00a0billion to $8\u00a0billion; with considerable facilitating by the White House, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) of 1965 passed the House by a vote of 263 to 153 on March 26, and then the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) of 1965 remarkably passed without a change in the Senate, by 73 to 8, without going through the usual conference committee. passed was a historic accomplishment by [0], with the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) of 1965 passing as introduced just 87\u00a0days before.Although the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) of 1965 solidified [0]'s support among K-12 teachers' unions, neither the Higher Education Act nor the new endowments mollified the college professors and students growing increasingly uneasy with the war in Vietnam. [0]'s second major education program was the Higher Education Act of 1965, which focused on funding for lower-income students. In 1967, [0] signed the Public Broadcasting Act to create educational television programs to supplement broadcast networks.In 1965, [0] set up the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Endowment for the Arts, to support the study of literature, history, and law, and arts such as music, painting, and sculpture (as the WPA once did).", "\"War on Poverty\" and healthcare reform": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 1964, at [0]'s request, Congress passed the Revenue Act of 1964 and the Economic Opportunity Act, as part of the war on poverty. [0] set in motion legislation creating programs such as Head Start, food stamps and Work Study. During [0]'s years in office, national poverty declined significantly, with the percentage of Americans living below the poverty line dropping from 23 to 12\u00a0percent. [0] took an additional step in the war on poverty with an urban renewal effort, presenting to Congress in January 1966 the \"Demonstration Cities Program\". To be eligible a city would need to demonstrate a city's readiness to \"arrest blight and decay and make a substantial impact on the development of a city's entire city\". [0] requested an investment of $400\u00a0million per year totaling $2.4\u00a0billion. In fall 1966 Congress passed a substantially reduced program costing $900\u00a0million, which Johnson later called the Model Cities Program. Changing the name had little effect on the success of a substantially reduced program costing $900\u00a0million, which Johnson later called the Model Cities Program; the New York Times wrote 22\u00a0years later that a substantially reduced program costing $900\u00a0million, which Johnson later called the Model Cities Program was largely a failure.[0]'s initial effort to improve healthcare was the creation of The Commission on Heart Disease, Cancer, and Strokes (HDCS). Heart Disease, Cancer, and Strokes accounted for 71\u00a0percent of the nation's deaths in 1962. To enact recommendations of The Commission on Heart Disease, Cancer, and Strokes (HDCS), [0] asked Congress for funds to set up the Regional Medical Program (RMP), to create a network of hospitals with federally funded research and practice; Congress passed a significantly watered-down version.As a back-up position, in 1965 [0] turned [0]'s focus to hospital insurance for the aged under Social Security. The key player in initiating hospital insurance for the aged under Social Security was Wilbur Mills, Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. To reduce Republican opposition, Wilbur Mills, Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee suggested that hospital insurance for the aged under Social Security be fashioned as three layers: hospital insurance under Social Security; a voluntary insurance program for doctor visits; and an expanded medical welfare program for the poor, known as Medicaid. The bill passed the house by a margin of 110 votes on April 8. The effort in the Senate was considerably more complicated, but The bill passed Congress on July 28. hospital insurance for the aged under Social Security now covers tens of millions of Americans. [0] gave the first two hospital insurance for the aged under Social Security cards to former President Harry S Truman and [0]'s wife Bess after signing The bill at the Truman Library in Independence, Missouri.", "Transportation": "[0] is our person to focus on. In March 1965, [0] sent to Congress a transportation message which included the creation of a new Transportation Department, comprising the Commerce Department's Office of Transportation, the Bureau of Public Roads, the Federal Aviation Agency, the Coast Guard, the Maritime Administration, the Civil Aeronautics Board, and the Interstate Commerce Commission. The bill passed the Senate after some negotiation over navigation projects; in the House, passage required negotiation over maritime interests and The bill was signed October 15, 1965.", "Gun control": "[0] is our person to focus on. Though [0] had already introduced a gun control bill on June 6, 1968, after the assassination of Robert Kennedy, [0]'s press secretary Liz Carpenter, in a memo to the president, worried that the country had been \"brainwashed by high drama,\" and that [0] \"need[ed] some quick dramatic actions\" that addressed \"the issue of violence.\" In October, [0] signed a gun control bill, but did not invoke the memory of Robert Kennedy as [0] had so often done with Robert Kennedy\u2013an omission historian Jeff Shesol has argued was motivated by [0]'s longstanding contempt for Robert Kennedy.", "Space program": "[0] is our person to focus on. During Johnson's administration, NASA conducted the Gemini crewed space program, developed the Saturn V rocket and the Saturn V rocket's launch facility, and prepared to make the first crewed Apollo program flights. On January 27, 1967, the nation was stunned when the entire crew of Apollo 1 was killed in a cabin fire during a spacecraft test on the launch pad, stopping Apollo program in Apollo program's tracks. Rather than appointing another Warren-style commission, [0] accepted Administrator James E. Webb's request for NASA to do NASA's investigation. [0] maintained [0]'s staunch support of Apollo program through Congressional and press controversy, and Apollo program recovered. The first two crewed missions, Apollo 7 and the first crewed flight to the Moon, Apollo 8, were completed by the end of Johnson's administration. [0] congratulated the Apollo 8 crewthe first crewed flight to the Moon, Apollo 8 , saying, \"the Apollo 8 crew've taken ... all of us, all over the world, into a new era.\" On July 16, 1969, [0] attended the launch of the first the Moon landing mission Apollo 11, becoming the first former or incumbent U.S. president to witness a rocket launch.", "Urban riots": "Lyndon Johnson is our person to focus on. [0] caused a series of \"long hot summers.\" [0] started with the Harlem riots in 1964, and the Watts district of Los Angeles in 1965, and extended to 1971. The momentum for the advancement of civil rights came to a sudden halt in with the Watts district of Los Angelesthe Watts district of Los Angeles. After 34 people were killed and $35\u00a0million (equivalent to $325.02\u00a0million in 2022) in property was damaged, the public feared an expansion of the violence to other cities, and so the appetite for additional programs in Lyndon Johnson's agenda was lost.Six days of rioting in Newark in 1967 left 26 dead, 1,500 injured, and Newark a burned-out shell. In Detroit in 1967, Governor George Romney sent in 7,400 national guard troops to quell fire bombings, looting, and attacks on businesses and police. Lyndon Johnson finally sent in federal troops with tanks and machine guns. Detroit continued to burn for three more days until finally, 43 were dead, 2,250 were injured, 4,000 were arrested; property damage ranged into the hundreds of millions. The biggest wave of riots came in April 1968, in over a hundred cities after the assassination of Martin Luther King. Lyndon Johnson called for even more billions to be spent in the cities and another federal civil rights law regarding housing, but called had little Congressional support. Lyndon Johnson's popularity plummeted as a massive white political backlash took shape, reinforcing the sense Lyndon Johnson had lost control of the streets of major cities as well as Lyndon Johnson's party. Lyndon Johnson created the Kerner Commission to study the problem of urban riots, headed by Illinois Governor Otto Kerner. According to press secretary George Christian, Lyndon Johnson was unsurprised by the riots, saying: \"What did you expect? ... When you put your foot on a man's's neck and hold a man's down for three hundred years, and then you let a man's up, what's a man's going to do? a man's's going to knock your block off.\"As a result of rioting in Washington, D.C., after the assassination of Martin Luther King, Lyndon Johnson determined that \"a condition of domestic violence and disorder\" existed and issued an executive order mobilizing combat-equipped troops. The New York Times reported that 4,000 regular Army and National Guard troops entered the capital \"to try to end riotous looting, burglarizing and burning by roving bands of Negro youths\".  Some of 4,000 regular Army and National Guard troops were sent to guard the Capitol and the White House.", "Backlash against Johnson (1966\u20131967)": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 1966, the press sensed a \"credibility gap\" between what [0] was saying in press conferences and what was happening in Vietnam, which led to much less favorable coverage.By 1966's end, the Democratic governor of Missouri, Warren E. Hearnes, warned that [0] would lose Missouri by 100,000 votes, despite winning by a margin of 500,000 in 1964. \"Frustration over Vietnam; too much federal spending and ... taxation; no great public support for your Great Society programs; and ... public disenchantment with the civil rights programs \"had eroded [0]'s standing, the Democratic governor of Missouri, Warren E. Hearnes, reported. There were bright spots; in January 1967, [0] boasted that wages were the highest in history, unemployment was at a 13-year low, and corporate profits and farm incomes were greater than ever; a 4.5\u00a0percent jump in consumer prices was worrisome, as was the rise in interest rates. [0] asked for a temporary 6\u00a0percent surcharge in income taxes to cover the mounting deficit caused by increased spending. [0]'s approval ratings stayed below 50\u00a0percent; by January 1967, the number of [0]'s strong supporters had plunged to 16\u00a0percent, from 25\u00a0percent four months before. [0] ran about even with Republican George Romney in trial matchups that spring. Asked to explain why [0] was unpopular, [0] responded, \"[0] am a dominating personality, and when [0] get things done [0] don't always please all the people.\" [0] also blamed the press, saying the press showed \"complete irresponsibility and lie and misstate facts and have no one to be answerable to\", and \"the preachers, liberals and professors\" who had turned against [0].In the congressional elections of 1966, the Republicans gained three seats in the Senate and 47 in the House, reinvigorating the conservative coalition and making it more difficult for [0] to pass additional Great Society legislation. However, Congress ultimately passed almost 96\u00a0percent of your Great Society programs.", "Vietnam War": "Lyndon Johnson is our person to focus on. At Kennedy's's death, there were 16,000 American military personnel in [0] supporting South Vietnam in the war against North Vietnam. [0] had been partitioned at the 1954 Geneva Conference, with North Vietnam led by a Communist government. Lyndon Johnson subscribed to the Domino Theory and to a containment policy that required America to make a serious effort to stop all Communist expansion. On taking office, Lyndon Johnson immediately reversed Kennedy's's order to withdraw 1,000 military personnel by the end of 1963. In late summer 1964, Lyndon Johnson seriously questioned the value of staying in [0] but, after meeting with Secretary of State Dean Rusk and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Maxwell D. Taylor, declared Lyndon Johnson's readiness \"to do more when we had a base\" or when Saigon was politically more stable. Lyndon Johnson expanded the numbers and roles of the American military following the Gulf of Tonkin Incident.[citation needed]In August 1964, allegations arose from the military that two U.S. destroyers had been attacked by North Vietnamese torpedo boats in international waters 40 miles (64\u00a0km) from the Vietnamese coast in Gulf of Tonkin; naval communications and reports of attacked were contradictory. Although Lyndon Johnson wanted to keep discussions about [0] out of the 1964 election campaign, Lyndon Johnson felt forced to respond, so Lyndon Johnson sought and obtained from the Congress the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution on August 7. Lyndon Johnson was determined to embolden Lyndon Johnson's image on foreign policy, and also wanted to prevent criticism such as Truman had received in Korea by proceeding without congressional endorsement of military action. Responding to attacked would also blunt campaign criticism of weakness from the hawkish Goldwater camp. the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution gave congressional approval for use of military force by the commander-in-chief to repel future attacks and also to assist members of SEATO requesting assistance. Lyndon Johnson later in the 1964 election campaign expressed assurance that the primary U.S. goal remained the preservation of South Vietnamese independence through material and advice, as opposed to any offensive posture. The public's reaction to the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution at the time was positive\u201448\u00a0percent favored stronger measures in [0] and only 14\u00a0percent wanted to negotiate a settlement and leave.In the 1964 election campaign, Lyndon Johnson restated Lyndon Johnson's determination to provide measured support for [0] while avoiding another Korea; but privately Lyndon Johnson had a sense of foreboding, that no matter what Lyndon Johnson did things would end badly. Lyndon Johnson's heart was in Lyndon Johnson's Great Society agenda, and Lyndon Johnson even felt that Lyndon Johnson's political opponents favored greater intervention in [0] to divert attention and resources away from Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty. The situation on the ground was aggravated in the fall by additional Viet Minh attacks on U.S. ships in the Tonkin Gulf, as well as an attack on Bien Hoa Air Base in South Vietnam. Lyndon Johnson decided against retaliatory action after consultation with the Joint Chiefs, and also after public pollster Lou Harris confirmed that Lyndon Johnson's would not detrimentally affect Lyndon Johnson at the polls. By the end of 1964, there were approximately 23,000 military personnel in South Vietnam; U.S. casualties for 1964 totaled 1,278.In the winter of 1964\u20131965, Lyndon Johnson was pressured by the military to begin a bombing campaign to forcefully resist a communist takeover in South Vietnam; moreover, a plurality in the polls at the time was in favor of military action, with only 26 to 30\u00a0percent opposed. Lyndon Johnson revised Lyndon Johnson's priorities, and a new preference for stronger action came at the end of January with yet another change of government in Saigon. Lyndon Johnson then agreed with Mac Bundy and McNamara that the continued passive role would only lead to defeat and humiliation. Lyndon Johnson said, \"Stable government or no stable government in Saigon we will do what we ought to do. Lyndon Johnson'm prepared to do that; we will move strongly. General Nguy\u1ec5n Kh\u00e1nh [head of Saigon] is we's boy\".Lyndon Johnson decided on a systematic bombing campaign in February after a ground report from Mac Bundy recommending immediate U.S. action to avoid defeat; also, Viet Minh had just killed eight U.S. advisers and wounded dozens in an attack at Pleiku Air Base. a systematic bombing campaign became known as Operation Rolling Thunder. Lyndon Johnson's instructions for public consumption were clear: there was to be no comment that the war effort had been expanded. Long-term estimates of a systematic bombing campaign ranged from an expectation that Hanoi would rein in Viet Minh to one of provoking Hanoi and Viet Minh into an intensification of the war against North Vietnam. But the short-term expectations were consistent that the morale and stability of South Vietnam would be bolstered. By limiting the information given out to the public, and even to the Congress, Lyndon Johnson maximized Lyndon Johnson's flexibility to change course.In March, Mac Bundy began to urge the use of ground forces\u2014air operations alone, Mac Bundy counseled, would not stop Hanoi's aggression against South Vietnam. Lyndon Johnson approved an increase in logistical troops of 18,000 to 20,000 and the deployment of two additional Marine battalions and a Marine air squadron, in addition to planning for the deployment of two more divisions. More significantly, Lyndon Johnson authorized a change in mission from defensive to offensive operations; Lyndon Johnson nevertheless insisted that a change in mission from defensive to offensive operations was not to be publicly represented as a policy change.By mid-June, the total U.S. ground forces in [0] had increased to 82,000 or by 150 percent. mid-June, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Maxwell D. Taylor reported that the bombing offensive against North Vietnam had been ineffective and that the South Vietnamese army was outclassed and in danger of collapse. General Westmoreland shortly thereafter recommended Lyndon Johnson further increase ground troops to 175,000. After consulting with Lyndon Johnson's principals, Lyndon Johnson, desirous of a low profile, chose to announce at a press conference an increase to 125,000 troops, with additional forces to be sent later upon request. Lyndon Johnson described Lyndon Johnson at the time as boxed in by unpalatable choices: sending Americans to die in [0] and being attacked as an interventionist, or giving in to the communists and risking being impeached. Lyndon Johnson continued to insist that Lyndon Johnson's \"did not imply any change in policy whatsoever\". Of Lyndon Johnson's desire to veil decided, Lyndon Johnson jested privately, \"If you have a mother-in-law with only one eye, and a mother-in-law with only one eye has only one eye in the center of a mother-in-law with only one eye's forehead, you don't keep a mother-in-law with only one eye in the living room\". By October 1965 there were over 200,000 troops deployed in [0].Lyndon Johnson underwent surgery on November 8, 1965, at the Bethesda Naval Hospital to remove Lyndon Johnson's gallbladder and a kidney stone. Afterward, Lyndon Johnson's doctors reported that Lyndon Johnson had come through surgery \"beautifully as expected\"; Lyndon Johnson was able to resume Lyndon Johnson's duties the next day. Lyndon Johnson met with reporters a couple of days later and reassured America that Lyndon Johnson was recovering well. Although Lyndon Johnson was incapacitated during surgery, there was no transfer of presidential power to Vice President Humphrey, as no constitutional procedure to do so existed. The Twenty-fifth Amendment, which the Congress had sent to the states for ratification four months earlier, included such provisions, but was not ratified until 1967.Public and political impatience with the war against North Vietnam began to emerge in the spring of 1966, and Lyndon Johnson's approval ratings reached a new low of 41\u00a0percent. Sen. Richard Russell, Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, reflected the national mood in June 1966 when Sen. Richard Russell, Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, declared it was time to \"get the war against North Vietnam over or get out\". Lyndon Johnson responded by saying to the press, \"we are trying to provide the maximum deterrence that we can to communist aggression with a minimum of cost.\" In response to the intensified criticism of the war against North Vietnam, Lyndon Johnson raised suspicions of communist subversion in America, and press relations became strained. Lyndon Johnson's primary war policy opponent in the Congress was the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, James William Fulbright, who convened a series of public hearings in February on the progress of the war against North Vietnam. Lyndon Johnson began to seriously consider a more focused bombing campaign against petroleum, oil and lubrication facilities in North Vietnam, in hopes of accelerating victory. Vice President Humphrey, Lyndon Johnson, and McNamara all agreed, and a systematic bombing campaign began at the end of June 1966. In July, polling results indicated that Americans favored a systematic bombing campaign by a five-to-one margin; however, in August a Defense Department study indicated that a systematic bombing campaign had little impact on North Vietnam.In fall 1966, multiple sources reported that progress was being made against the North Vietnamese logistics and infrastructure; Lyndon Johnson was urged from every corner to begin peace discussions. There was no shortage of peace initiatives; nevertheless, among protesters, English philosopher Bertrand Russell attacked Lyndon Johnson's policy as \"a barbaric aggressive war of conquest\", and in June 1966 English philosopher Bertrand Russell initiated the International War Crimes Tribunal to condemn the war against North Vietnam. The gap with Hanoi was an unbridgeable demand on both sides for a unilateral end to bombing and withdrawal of forces. In August, Lyndon Johnson appointed Averell Harriman \"Ambassador for Peace\" to promote negotiations. Mac Bundy and McNamara recommended a concerted program to promote pacification; Lyndon Johnson formally placed a concerted program to promote pacification under military control in October. Also in October 1966, to reassure and promote the war effort, Lyndon Johnson initiated a meeting with allies in Manila\u2014the South Vietnamese, Thais, South Koreans, Filipinos, Australians, and New Zealanders. a meeting with allies in Manila\u2014the South Vietnamese, Thais, South Koreans, Filipinos, Australians, and New Zealanders ended with pronouncements to stand fast against communist aggression and to promote ideals of democracy and development in [0] and across Asia. For Lyndon Johnson a meeting with allies in Manila\u2014the South Vietnamese, Thais, South Koreans, Filipinos, Australians, and New Zealanders was a fleeting public relations success\u2014confirmed by a 63 percent [0] approval rating in November. Nevertheless, in December, Lyndon Johnson's [0] approval rating was back down in the 40s; Lyndon Johnson had become anxious to justify war casualties, and talked of the need for a decisive victory, despite the unpopularity of the cause. In a discussion about the war against North Vietnam with former President Dwight Eisenhower on October 3, 1966, Lyndon Johnson said Lyndon Johnson was \"trying to win the war against North Vietnam just as fast as Lyndon Johnson can in every way that Lyndon Johnson know how\" and later stated that Lyndon Johnson needed \"all the help Lyndon Johnson can get\".By 1966's end, it was clear that pacification efforts were ineffectual, as had been a systematic bombing campaign. Lyndon Johnson agreed to McNamara's new recommendation to add 70,000 troops in 1967 to the 400,000 previously committed. While McNamara recommended no increase in the level of bombing, Lyndon Johnson agreed with Asia recommendations to increase bombing. a systematic bombing campaign began despite initial secret talks being held in Saigon, Hanoi, and Warsaw. While a systematic bombing campaign ended initial secret talks being held in Saigon, Hanoi, and Warsaw, North Vietnamese intentions were not considered genuine.In January and February 1967, probes were made to assess North Vietnam's willingness to discuss peace, but probes fell on deaf ears. Ho Chi Minh declared that the only solution was a unilateral U.S. withdrawal. A Gallup poll in July 1967 showed that 52\u00a0percent of Americans disapproved of Lyndon Johnson's handling of the war against North Vietnam, and only 34\u00a0percent thought progress was being made. Lyndon Johnson's anger and frustration over the lack of a solution to Vietnam and the lack of a solution to Vietnam's effect on Lyndon Johnson politically was exhibited in a statement to Robert F. Kennedy, who had become a prominent public critic of the war and loomed as a potential challenger in the 1968 presidential election. Lyndon Johnson had just received several reports predicting military progress by the summer, and warned Robert F. Kennedy, who had become a prominent public critic of the war and loomed as a potential challenger in the 1968 presidential election, \"Lyndon Johnson'll destroy Robert F. Kennedy, who had become a prominent public critic of the war and loomed as a potential challenger in the 1968 presidential election and every one of Robert F. Kennedy, who had become a prominent public critic of the war and loomed as a potential challenger in the 1968 presidential election's dove friends in six months\". McNamara offered Lyndon Johnson a way out of [0] in May; the administration could declare the administration's objective in the war against North Vietnam\u2014South Vietnam's self-determination\u2014was being achieved and the upcoming September elections in South Vietnam would provide the chance for a coalition government. America could reasonably expect South Vietnam to then assume responsibility for the election outcome. But Lyndon Johnson was reluctant, in light of some optimistic reports about the conflict that provided hope of improvement, though some optimistic reports about the conflict that provided hope of improvement were of questionable reliability. Meantime, Asia was reporting wide food shortages in Hanoi and an unstable power grid, as well as military manpower reductions.By the middle of 1967, nearly 70,000 Americans had been killed or wounded in the war against North Vietnam. In July, Lyndon Johnson sent McNamara, Wheeler, and other officials to meet with General Westmoreland and reach an agreement on plans for the immediate future. At that time the war against North Vietnam was being commonly described by the press and others as a \"stalemate\". General Westmoreland said such a description was pure fiction, and that \"we are winning slowly but steadily and the pace can excel if we reinforce we's successes\". Though General Westmoreland sought many more, Lyndon Johnson agreed to an increase of 55,000 troops bringing the total to 525,000. In August Lyndon Johnson, with the Joint Chiefs's support, decided to expand a systematic bombing campaign and exempted only Hanoi, Haiphong and a buffer zone with China from the target list. In September Ho Chi Minh and North Vietnamese premier Pham Van Dong appeared amenable to French mediation, so Lyndon Johnson ceased bombing in a 10-mile zone around Hanoi. In a Texas speech, Lyndon Johnson agreed to halt all bombing if Ho Chi Minh would launch productive discussions and if North Vietnam would not seek to take advantage of halt; agreed was named the \"San Antonio\" formula. There was no response, but Lyndon Johnson pursued the possibility of negotiations with such a bombing pause.With the war against North Vietnam still arguably in a stalemate and in light of the widespread disapproval of the war against North Vietnam, Lyndon Johnson convened a group called the \"Wise Men\" for an in-depth look at the war against North Vietnam\u2014Dean Acheson, General Omar Bradley, George Ball, Mac Bundy, Arthur Dean, Douglas Dillon, Abe Fortas, Averell Harriman, Henry Cabot Lodge, Robert Murphy and Max Taylor. At that time McNamara, reversing McNamara's position on the war against North Vietnam, recommended that a cap of 525,000 be placed on the number of forces deployed and that all bombing be halted since McNamara could see no success. Lyndon Johnson was quite agitated by recommended and McNamara's resignation soon followed. Except for George Ball, a group called the \"Wise Men\" agreed the administration should \"press forward\". Lyndon Johnson was confident that Hanoi would await the 1968 U.S. election results before deciding to negotiate.On June 23, 1967, Lyndon Johnson traveled to Los Angeles for a Democratic fundraiser. Thousands of anti-war protesters led by a coalition of peace protestors tried to march past the hotel where he was speaking. However, a small group of Progressive Labor Party and SDS protestors activists placed a small group of Progressive Labor Party and SDS protestors activists at the head of march and, when a small group of Progressive Labor Party and SDS protestors activists reached the hotel where he was speaking, staged a sit-down. Efforts by march monitors to keep the main body of Thousands of anti-war protesters led by a coalition of peace protestors moving were only partially successful. Hundreds of LAPD officers were massed at the hotel where he was speaking and when march slowed an order was given to disperse Thousands of anti-war protesters led by a coalition of peace protestors. The riot act was read and 51 protestors arrested. This was one of the first massive war protests in America, and the first in Los Angeles. Ending in a clash with riot police, This set a pattern for the massive protests which followed. Due to the size and violence of This, Lyndon Johnson attempted no further public speeches outside military bases.In October, with ever-increasing public protests against the war against North Vietnam, Lyndon Johnson engaged the FBI and Asia to investigate, monitor and undermine anti-war activists. In mid-October, there was a demonstration of 100,000 at the Pentagon; Ho Chi Minh and North Vietnamese premier Pham Van Dong were convinced that foreign communist sources were behind the demonstration, which was refuted by Asia findings.On January 30, the Viet Cong and North Vietnam launched the Tet Offensive against South Vietnam's five largest cities, including Saigon and the U.S. embassy there. While the Tet Offensive failed militarily, the Tet Offensive was a psychological victory, definitively turning American public opinion against the war against North Vietnam. Iconically, Walter Cronkite of CBS News, voted the nation's \"most trusted person\" in February, opined on the air that the war against North Vietnam was deadlocked. Lyndon Johnson reacted, saying \"If Lyndon Johnson've lost Walter Cronkite of CBS News, voted the nation's \"most trusted person\" in February, Lyndon Johnson've lost middle America\". Indeed, demoralization about the war against North Vietnam was everywhere; 26\u00a0percent then approved of Lyndon Johnson's handling of [0]; 63\u00a0percent disapproved. Lyndon Johnson agreed to increase the troop level by 22,000, despite a recommendation from the Joint Chiefs for ten times that number. By March 1968, Lyndon Johnson was secretly desperate for an honorable way out of the war against North Vietnam. Clark Clifford, the new Defense Secretary, described the war against North Vietnam as \"a loser\" and proposed to \"cut losses and get out\". On March 31, Lyndon Johnson spoke to America of \"Steps to Limit the war against North Vietnam\". Lyndon Johnson then announced an immediate unilateral halt to the bombing of North Vietnam and announced Lyndon Johnson's intention to seek out peace talks anywhere at any time. At the close of Lyndon Johnson's Lyndon Johnson announced, \"Lyndon Johnson shall not seek, and Lyndon Johnson will not accept, the nomination of Lyndon Johnson's party for another term as America's President\".In March 1968, Lyndon Johnson decided to restrict future bombing with the result that 75\u00a0percent of North Vietnam's territory, containing 90\u00a0percent of North Vietnam's population, was off-limits to bombing. In April Lyndon Johnson succeeded in opening discussions of peace talks, and after extensive negotiations over the site, Paris was agreed to and talks began in May. When talks failed to yield any results the decision was made to resort to private discussions in Paris, which after two months proved to be no more productive.As casualties mounted and success seemed further away, Lyndon Johnson's popularity plummeted. College students and others protested, burned draft cards, and chanted, \"Hey, hey, Lyndon Johnson, how many kids did Lyndon Johnson kill today?\" Lyndon Johnson could scarcely travel anywhere without facing protests, and was not allowed by the Secret Service to attend the 1968 Democratic National Convention, where thousands of hippies, yippies, Black Panthers and other opponents of Lyndon Johnson's policies converged to protest. Thus by 1967, the public was polarized, with the \"hawks\" rejecting Lyndon Johnson's refusal to continue the war against North Vietnam indefinitely, and the \"doves\" rejecting Lyndon Johnson's current war policies. Support for Lyndon Johnson's middle position continued to shrink until Lyndon Johnson finally rejected containment and sought a peace settlement. By late summer, Lyndon Johnson realized that Nixon was closer to Nixon's position than Vice President Humphrey. Lyndon Johnson continued to support Vice President Humphrey publicly in the 1964 election campaign, and personally despised Nixon. One of Lyndon Johnson's well-known quotes was \"the Democratic party at the Democratic party's worst, is still better than the Republican party at its best\"the Republican party at its best\"'s .Despite recommendations in August from Averell Harriman, Vance, Clifford, and Mac Bundy to halt bombing as an incentive for Hanoi to engage in substantive peace talks, Lyndon Johnson refused. In October, when both sides came close to an agreement on a bombing halt, Nixon intervened with the South Vietnamese, making promises of better terms, to delay a settlement until after the 1964 election campaign. After the 1964 election campaign, Lyndon Johnson's primary focus on [0] was to get Saigon to join the Paris peace talks. Only after Nixon added Nixon's urging did Saigon do so. Even then Saigon argued about procedural matters until after Nixon took office.", "Surveillance of Martin Luther King": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] continued the FBI's wiretapping of Martin Luther King Jr. authorized by the Kennedy administration under Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy. [0] also authorized the tapping of phone conversations of others, including the Vietnamese friends of a Nixon associate.", "International trips": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] made eleven international trips to twenty countries during [0]'s presidency. [0] flew five hundred twenty-three thousand miles (841,690\u00a0km) aboard Air Force One while in office. [0]'s October 1966 visit to Australia sparked demonstrations from anti-war protesters. One of the most unusual international trips in presidential history occurred before Christmas 1967. [0] began One of the most unusual international trips in presidential history by going to the memorial for Australian Prime Minister Harold Holt, who was presumed drowned in a swimming accident. The White House did not reveal in advance to the press that [0] would make One of the most unusual international trips in presidential history. One of the most unusual international trips in presidential history was twenty-six thousand nine hundred fifty-nine miles (43,386.3\u00a0km) completed in only 112.5\u00a0hours (4.7\u00a0days). Air Force One crossed the equator twice, stopped at Travis Air Force Base, in Honolulu, Pago Pago, Canberra, Melbourne, Vietnam, Karachi, and Rome.", "1968 presidential election": "[0] is our person to focus on. As [0] had served less than 24\u00a0months of President Kennedy's's term, [0] was constitutionally permitted to run for a second full term in 1968. Initially, no prominent Democratic candidate was prepared to run against a sitting Democratic president. Only Senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota challenged [0] as an anti-war candidate in the New Hampshire primary, hoping to pressure the Democrats to oppose the Vietnam War. On March 12, Only Senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota won 42\u00a0percent of the primary vote to [0]'s 49\u00a0percent, an amazingly strong showing for such a challenger. Four days later, Senator Robert F. Kennedy of New York entered the race. Internal polling by [0]'s campaign in Wisconsin, the next state to hold a primary, showed [0] trailing badly. [0] did not leave the White House to campaign.By this time [0] had lost control of the Democrats. The first consisted of [0] (and Humphrey), labor unions, and local party bosses led by Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley. The second consisted of students and intellectuals who were vociferously against the Vietnam War and rallied behind Only Senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota. The third group was Catholics, Hispanics, and African Americans, who rallied behind Senator Robert F. Kennedy of New York. The fourth group was traditionally segregationist white Southerners, who rallied behind George C. Wallace and the American Independent Party. Vietnam was one of many issues that splintered the Democrats, and [0] could see no way to win the Vietnam War or unite the Democrats long enough to win re-election.Although it was not made public at the time, another reason [0] decided not to seek re-election is that [0] was worried about [0]'s failing health and was concerned that [0] might not live through another four-year term. In 1967, [0] secretly commissioned an actuarial study that accurately predicted [0] would die at age 64.In early January 1968, [0] asked former speechwriter Horace Busby to draft a withdrawal statement for his upcoming State of the Union address, but [0] did not include a withdrawal statement for his upcoming State of the Union address. Two months later, however, spurred by [0]'s health concerns and by a growing realization that [0]'s political capital was all but gone, [0] again considered withdrawing, discussing withdrawing with Joseph Califano and Harry McPherson on March 28. Three days later, [0] announced [0] would not run for re-election by concluding with the line: \"[0] shall not seek, and [0] will not accept, the nomination of the Democrats for another term as your President.\" The next day, [0]'s approval ratings increased from 36\u00a0percent to 49\u00a0percent.After President Kennedy's's assassination, [0] rallied the party bosses and unions to nominate Humphrey at the 1968 Democratic National Convention. Personal correspondences between [0] and some in the Democrats suggested [0] tacitly supported Nelson Rockefeller's's campaign. [0] reportedly said that if Nelson Rockefeller's became the Republican nominee, [0] would not campaign against Nelson Rockefeller's (and would not campaign for Humphrey). In what was termed the October surprise, [0] announced to the nation on October 31, 1968, that [0] had ordered a complete cessation of \"all air, naval and artillery bombardment of North Vietnam\", effective November 1, should the Hanoi Government be willing to negotiate and citing progress with the Paris peace talks. In the end, Democrats did not fully unite behind Humphrey, enabling Republican candidate Richard Nixon to win the election.", "Judicial appointments": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] appointed Justices Abe Fortas (1965) and Thurgood Marshall (1967) to the Supreme Court of the United States. [0] anticipated court challenges to [0]'s legislative measures in 1965 and thought it advantageous to have a \"mole\" in the Supreme Court of the United States to provide [0] with inside information, as [0] was able to get from the legislative branch. Abe Fortas in particular [0] thought could fill the bill. The opportunity arose when an opening occurred for ambassador to the United States, with Adlai Stevenson's death; Associate Justice Arthur Goldberg accepted [0]'s offer to transfer to the the United States position. [0] insisted on Abe Fortas assuming Associate Justice Arthur Goldberg's seat, over Fortas's wife's's objection that it was too early in Abe Fortas's career. Fortas's wife's expressed disapproval to Johnson personally afterward. When Earl Warren announced Earl Warren's retirement in 1968, [0] nominated Abe Fortas to succeed Earl Warren as Chief Justice of the United States, and nominated Homer Thornberry to succeed Abe Fortas as associate justice. However, Abe Fortas's was filibustered by senators, and neither nominee was voted upon by the full Senate."}, "Post-presidency (1969\u20131973)": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. On Inauguration Day (January 20, 1969), [0] saw Nixon sworn in, then got on the plane to fly back to Texas. When the front door of the plane closed, [0] pulled out a cigarette\u2014his first cigarette he had smoked since his heart attack in 1955. One of his daughters pulled a cigarette\u2014his first cigarette he had smoked since his heart attack in 1955 out of [0]'s mouth and said, \"[0], what are [0] doing? [0]'re going to kill [0].\" [0] took a cigarette\u2014his first cigarette he had smoked since his heart attack in 1955 back and said, \"[0]'ve now raised his daughters, his daughters. [0]'ve now been President. Now it's [0]'s time!\" From that point on, [0] went into a very self-destructive spiral. After leaving the presidency in January 1969, [0] went home to his ranch in Stonewall, Texas, accompanied by former aide and speechwriter Harry J. Middleton, who would draft [0]'s first book, The Choices We Face, and work with [0] on [0]'s memoirs, The Vantage Point: Perspectives of the presidency 1963\u20131969, published in 1971. 1971, the [0] Library and Museum opened on the campus of The University of Texas at Austin.

Johnson National Historical Park, with the provision that his ranch in Stonewall, Texas \"remain a working ranch and not become a sterile relic of the past\".[0] gave Nixon high grades in foreign policy, but worried that [0]'s was being pressured into removing U.S. forces from South Vietnam before the South Vietnamese were able to defend the South Vietnamese. \"If South Vietnam falls to the Communists, we can have a serious backlash here at home,\" [0] warned.During the 1972 presidential election, [0] only reluctantly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee George McGovern, a senator from South Dakota; Democratic presidential nominee George McGovern, a senator from South Dakota had long opposed [0]'s foreign and defense policies.

Johnson's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 John Connally had served as Nixon's Secretary of the Treasury and then stepped down to head \"Democrats for Nixon\", a group funded by Republicans.

[0] had also resumed smoking, having not smoked since [0]'s near-fatal heart attack in July 1955.

[0] continued to smoke heavily and, although nominally on a low-calorie, low-cholesterol diet, kept to a low-calorie, low-cholesterol diet only intermittently. Meanwhile, [0] began to experience severe abdominal pains, diagnosed as diverticulosis. His heart condition rapidly worsened and surgery was recommended. [0] flew to Houston to consult with heart specialist Michael DeBakey, where he learned his condition was terminal. heart specialist Michael DeBakey, where he learned his condition was terminal found that despite two of [0]'s coronary arteries being in urgent need of a coronary bypass, [0]'s heart was in such poor condition that [0] likely would have perished during surgery."}, "Death and funeral": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] recorded an hour-long television interview with newsman Walter Cronkite at his ranch on January 12, 1973, in which [0] discussed [0]'s legacy, particularly about the civil rights movement.

Pickle and former Secretary of State Dean Rusk eulogized him when he lay in state at the Capitol, was part of an unexpectedly busy week in Washington, D.C., beginning with Richard Nixon's second inauguration following the 1972 election. As [0] died only two days after Richard Nixon's second inauguration following the 1972 election, the remainder of the ceremonies surrounding Richard Nixon's second inauguration following the 1972 election were cancelled to allow for a state funeral in which Texas Congressman J.

According to biographer Randall Woods, [0] posed in many different roles:\"Johnson the Son of the Tenant Farmer, Johnson the Great Compromiser, Johnson the All-Knowing, Johnson the Humble, Johnson the Warrior, Johnson the Dove, Johnson the Romantic, Johnson the Hard-Headed Pragmatist, Johnson the Preserver of Traditions, Johnson the Crusader for Social Justice, Johnson the Magnanimous, Johnson the Vindictive or Johnson the Uncouth, LBJ the Hick, Lyndon the Satyr, and Johnson the Usurper\". [0] was often seen as an ambitious, tireless, and imposing figure who was ruthlessly effective at getting legislation passed. [0] worked 18- to 20-hour days without break and had no leisure activities. \"There was no more powerful majority leader in American history,\" biographer Robert Dallek writes. biographer Robert Dallek stated that [0] had biographies on all the senators, knew what all the senators's ambitions, hopes, and tastes were and used knew to [0]'s advantage in securing votes. Another [0] biographer noted, \"[0] could get up every day and learn what all the senators's fears, all the senators's desires, all the senators's wishes, all the senators's wants were and [0] could then manipulate, dominate, persuade and cajole all the senators.\" As president, [0] vetoed 30 bills; no other president in history vetoed so many bills and never had a single one overridden by Congress. At 6\u00a0feet 3.5\u00a0inches (1.918\u00a0m) tall, [0] had his particular brand of persuasion, known as \"The Johnson Treatment\". A contemporary writes, \"his particular brand of persuasion, known as \"The Johnson Treatment\" was an incredible blend of badgering, cajolery, reminders of past favors, promises of future favors, predictions of gloom if something doesn't happen. When [0] started to work on you, all of a sudden, you just felt that you were standing under a waterfall and the stuff was pouring on you.[0]'s cowboy hat and boots reflected [0]'s Texas roots and love of the rural hill country. From 250 acres (100\u00a0ha) of land that [0] was given by an aunt in 1951, [0] created a 2,700-acre (1,100\u00a0ha) working ranch with 400 cattle. The National Park Service keeps a herd descended from [0]'s and maintains a 2,700-acre (1,100\u00a0ha) working ranch with 400 cattle.Biographer Randall Woods argues that Social Gospel themes [0] learned from childhood allowed [0] to transform social problems into moral problems. allowed helps explain [0]'s longtime commitment to social justice, as exemplified by the Great Society and [0]'s commitment to racial equality. Social Gospel explicitly inspired [0]'s foreign-policy approach to Christian internationalism and nation-building. For example, in a 1966 speech [0] quoted at length from the Social Creed of the Methodist Church, adding \"It would be very hard for [0] to write a more perfect description of the American ideal.\""}, "Legacy": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. Scholars have viewed [0] both through the lens of [0]'s historic legislative achievements, and [0]'s lack of success in the Vietnam War. [0]'s overall rating among historians has remained relatively steady, and [0]'s average ranking is higher than any of the eight presidents who followed him, although similar to Reagan and Clinton. However, in public polling of presidential favourability of [0] and the eight presidents who followed him [0] tends to appear more towards the bottom of lists, typically excepting George W. Bush and Richard Nixon, though sometimes also appearing above Gerald Ford while more usually below.Historian Kent Germany explains [0]'s evolving public legacy: [0] now seems to be remembered best by the public for succeeding an assassinated hero, steering the country into a quagmire in Vietnam, cheating on [0]'s saintly wife, exposing [0]'s stitched-up belly, using profanity, picking up dogs by dogs's ears, swimming naked with advisers in the White House pool, and emptying [0]'s bowels while conducting official business. Of all those issues, [0]'s reputation suffers the most from [0]'s management of the Vietnam War, something that has overshadowed [0]'s civil rights and domestic policy accomplishments and caused [0] to regret [0]'s handling of \"the woman [0] really loved\u2014the Great Society.\" ", "Memorials": "[0] is our person to focus on.
