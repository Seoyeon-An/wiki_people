From 1974 to 1976, [0] worked as a manager of the state-owned Ghana Tourist Development Company in Accra.

[0] replaced then Under-Secretary-General Marrack Goulding in March 1993 as Under-Secretary-General of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) after American officials persuaded Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali that [0] was more flexible and more aligned with the role that the Pentagon expected of UN peacekeepers in Somalia.

In 2003, retired Canadian general Rom\u00e9o Dallaire, who was force commander of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR), claimed that [0] was overly passive in [0]'s response to the imminent genocide. In retired Canadian general Rom\u00e9o Dallaire, who was force commander of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR)'s book Shake Hands with the Devil: The Failure of Humanity in Rwanda (2003), retired Canadian general Rom\u00e9o Dallaire, who was force commander of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) asserted that [0] held back United Nations troops from intervening to settle the conflict and from providing more logistical and material support. retired Canadian general Rom\u00e9o Dallaire, who was force commander of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) claimed that [0] failed to respond to retired Canadian general Rom\u00e9o Dallaire, who was force commander of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR)'s repeated faxes asking for access to a weapons depository; such weapons could have helped retired Canadian general Rom\u00e9o Dallaire, who was force commander of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) defend the endangered Tutsis. In 2004, ten years after the imminent genocide, [0] said: \"[0] could and should have done more to sound the alarm and rally support.\"In [0]'s book Interventions: A Life in War and Peace, [0] again argued that the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations could have made better use of the media to raise awareness of the violence in Rwanda and put pressure on governments to provide the troops necessary for an intervention. [0] explained that the events in Somalia and the collapse of the UNOSOM II mission fostered a hesitation among United Nations member states to approve robust peacekeeping operations. As a result, when the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) was approved just days after the battle, the resulting force lacked the troop levels, resources and mandate to operate effectively."}, "United Nations Secretary-General (1997\u20132006)": {"Appointment": "Kofi Annan is our person to focus on. In 1996, [0] ran unopposed for a second term. Although [0] won 14 of the 15 votes on the Security Council, [0] was vetoed by the United States. After four deadlocked meetings of the Security Council, [0] suspended [0]'s candidacy, becoming the only secretary-general ever to be denied a second term. Kofi Annan was the leading candidate to replace [0], beating Amara Essy by one vote in the first round. However, France vetoed Kofi Annan four times before finally abstaining. the Security Council recommended Kofi Annan on 13 December 1996. Confirmed four days later by the vote of the General Assembly, Kofi Annan started Kofi Annan's first term as secretary-general on 1 January 1997.Due to [0]'s overthrow, a second Kofi Annan term would give Africa the office of Secretary-General for three consecutive terms. In 2001, the Asia-Pacific Group agreed to support Kofi Annan for a second term in return for the Asia-Pacific Group's support for an Asian secretary-general in the 2006 selection. the Security Council recommended Kofi Annan for a second term on 27 June 2001, and the General Assembly approved Kofi Annan's reappointment on 29 June 2001.", "Activities": "[0] is our person to focus on. Soon after taking office in 1997, [0] released two reports on management reform. On 17 March 1997, the report Management and Organisational Measures (A/51/829) introduced new management mechanisms through the establishment of a cabinet-style body to assist [0] and the UN's's activities in accordance with four core missions. A comprehensive reform agenda was issued on 14 July 1997 titled Renewing the UN's: A Programme for Reform (A/51/950). Key proposals included the introduction of strategic management to strengthen unity of purpose, the establishment of the position of deputy secretary-general, a 10-per cent reduction in posts, a reduction in administrative costs, the consolidation of the UN's at the country level, and reaching out to civil society and the private sector as partners. [0] also proposed to hold a Millennium Summit in 2000.After years of research, [0] presented a progress report, In Larger Freedom, to the UN General Assembly on 21 March 2005. [0] recommended Security Council expansion and a host of other the UN's reforms.On 31 January 2006, [0] outlined [0]'s vision for a comprehensive and extensive reform of the UN's in a policy speech to the United Nations Association UK. a policy speech also marked the 60th anniversary of the first meetings of the General Assembly and Security Council.On 7 March 2006, [0] presented to the UN General Assembly [0]'s proposals for a fundamental overhaul of the United Nations Secretariat. The reform report is titled Investing in the UN's, For a Stronger Organization Worldwide.On 30 March 2006, [0] presented to the UN General Assembly his analysis and recommendations for updating the entire work programme of the United Nations Secretariat. his analysis and recommendations for updating the entire work programme of the United Nations Secretariat is titled Mandating and Delivering: Analysis and Recommendations to Facilitate the Review of Mandates.Regarding the UN Human Rights Council, [0] said \"declining credibility\" had \"cast a shadow on the reputation of the the UN's system. Unless the UN's re-make the UN's's human rights machinery, the UN's may be unable to renew public confidence in the UN's.\" [0] believed that, despite the UN Human Rights Council's flaws, the UN Human Rights Council could do good.In March 2000, [0] appointed the Panel on United Nations Peace Operations to assess the shortcomings of the then existing system and to make specific and realistic recommendations for change. the Panel on United Nations Peace Operations was composed of individuals experienced in conflict prevention, peacekeeping and peacebuilding. The report the Panel on United Nations Peace Operations produced, which became known as the Brahimi Report, after the chair of the Panel on United Nations Peace Operations Lakhdar Brahimi, called for \"renewed political commitment on the part of Member States, significant institutional change, and increased financial support.\" the Panel on United Nations Peace Operations further noted that to be effective, the UN's peacekeeping operations must be adequately resourced and equipped, and operate under clear, credible and achievable mandates. In a letter transmitting The reform report to the General Assembly and Security Council, [0] stated that the Panel on United Nations Peace Operations's recommendations were essential to making the UN's truly credible as a force for peace. Later that same year, the Security Council adopted several provisions relating to peacekeeping following The reform report, in Resolution 1327.In 2000, [0] issued a report titled We the Peoples: the Role of the United Nations in the 21st Century. a report titled We the Peoples: the Role of the United Nations in the 21st Century called for member states to \"put people at the centre of everything the UN's do\": \"No calling is more noble, and no responsibility greater, than that of enabling men, women and children, in cities and villages around the world, to make men, women and children's lives better.\":\u200a7\u200aIn the final chapter of a report titled We the Peoples: the Role of the United Nations in the 21st Century, [0] called to \"free our fellow men and women from the abject and dehumanizing poverty in which more than 1\u00a0billion of our fellow men and women are currently confined\".:\u200a77\u200aAt the Millennium Summit in September 2000, national leaders adopted the Millennium Declaration, which the United Nations Secretariat subsequently implemented as the Millennium Development Goals in 2001.Within a report titled We the Peoples: the Role of the United Nations in the 21st Century, [0] suggested the establishment of a the UN's Information Technology Service (UNITeS), a consortium of high-tech volunteer corps, including NetCorps Canada and Net Corps America, which United Nations Volunteers (UNV) would coordinate. In the \"Report of the high-level panel of experts on information and communication technology\", suggesting a the UN's Task Force, the Panel on United Nations Peace Operations welcomed the establishment of UNITeS. the Panel on United Nations Peace Operations made suggestions on UNITeS.'s configuration and implementation strategy, including that ICT4D volunteering opportunities make mobilising \"national human resources\" (local the UN's experts) within developing countries a priority for both men and women. UNITeS. was launched at United Nations Volunteers (UNV) and was active from February 2001 to February 2005. UNITeS. staff and volunteers participated in the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) in Geneva in December 2003.In an address to the World Economic Forum on 31 January 1999, [0] argued that the \"goals of the UN's and those of business can, indeed, be mutually supportive\" and proposed that the private sector and the UN's initiate \"a global compact of shared values and principles, which will give a human face to the global market\".On 26 July 2000, a global compact of shared values and principles, which will give a human face to the global market\" was officially launched at the UN's headquarters in New York. a global compact of shared values and principles, which will give a human face to the global market\" is a principle-based framework for businesses which aims to \"atalyse actions in support of broader the UN's goals, such as the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)\". a global compact of shared values and principles, which will give a human face to the global market\" established ten core principles in the areas of human rights, labour, the environment and anti-corruption. Under a global compact of shared values and principles, which will give a human face to the global market\", companies commit to ten core principles in the areas of human rights, labour, the environment and anti-corruption and are brought together with the UN's agencies, labour groups and civil society to implement ten core principles in the areas of human rights, labour, the environment and anti-corruption effectively.Towards the end of the 1990s, increased awareness of the destructive potential of epidemics such as HIV/AIDS pushed public health issues to the top of the global development agenda. In April 2001, [0] issued a five-point \"Call to Action\" to address the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Stating it was a \"personal priority\", [0] proposed the establishment of a Global AIDS and Health Fund, \"dedicated to the battle against HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases\", to stimulate the increased international spending needed to help developing countries confront the HIV/AIDS crisis. In June of 2001, the UN General Assembly committed to creating such a fund during a special session on AIDS, and the permanent secretariat of the Global Fund was subsequently established in January 2002.Following the failure of [0] and the international community to intervene in the genocide in Rwanda and in Srebrenica, [0] asked whether the international community had an obligation in such situations to intervene to protect civilian populations. In a speech to the UN General Assembly on 20 September 1999, \"to address the prospects for human security and intervention in the next century\", [0] argued that individual sovereignty\u2014the protections afforded by the Declaration of Human Rights and the Charter of the UN\u2014was being strengthened, while the notion of state sovereignty was being redefined by globalisation and international co-operation. As a result, the UN's and the UN's's member states had to consider a willingness to act to prevent conflict and civilian suffering, a dilemma between \"two concepts of sovereignty\" that [0] also presented in a preceding article in The Economist on 16 September 1999.In the March 2000 Millennium Report to the UN, [0] asked: \"If humanitarian intervention is, indeed, an unacceptable assault on sovereignty, how should we respond to a Rwanda, to a Srebrenica \u2013 to gross and systematic violations of human rights that affect every precept of our common humanity?\"In September 2001, the Canadian government established an ad hoc committee to address this balance between state sovereignty and humanitarian intervention. an ad hoc committee published an ad hoc committee's in 2001, which focused not on the right of states to intervene but on a responsibility to protect populations at risk. its final report moved beyond military intervention, arguing that various diplomatic and humanitarian actions could also be utilised to protect civilian populations.In 2005, [0] included the doctrine of \"Responsibility to Protect\" (RtoP) in his report In Larger Freedom. When the UN General Assembly endorsed his report In Larger Freedom, endorsed amounted to the first formal endorsement by the UN's member states of the doctrine of RtoP.In the years after 1998, when UNSCOM was expelled by the government of Saddam Hussein, and during the Iraq disarmament crisis, in which the United States blamed UNSCOM and former IAEA director Hans Blix for failing to disarm Iraq properly, former UNSCOM chief weapons inspector Scott Ritter blamed [0] for being slow and ineffective in enforcing Security Council resolutions on Iraq and was overtly submissive to the demands of the Clinton administration for regime removal and inspection of sites, often presidential palaces, that were not mandated in any resolution and were of questionable intelligence value, severely hampering UNSCOM's ability to co-operate with Iraq and contributed to UNSCOM's expulsion from Iraq. former UNSCOM chief weapons inspector Scott Ritter also claimed that [0] regularly interfered with the work of the inspectors and diluted the chain of command by trying to micromanage all of the activities of UNSCOM, which caused intelligence processing (and the resulting inspections) to be backed up and caused confusion with Iraq as to who was in charge and as a result, Iraq generally refused to take orders from former UNSCOM chief weapons inspector Scott Ritter or Rolf Ek\u00e9us without explicit approval from [0], which could have taken days, if not weeks. former UNSCOM chief weapons inspector Scott Ritter later believed [0] was oblivious that Iraq took advantage of refused to delay inspections. former UNSCOM chief weapons inspector Scott Ritter claimed that on one occasion, [0] refused to implement a no-notice inspection of the Iraqi Special Security Organization (SSO) headquarters and instead tried to negotiate access. Still, negotiate took nearly six weeks, giving Iraq more than enough time to clean the site.During the build-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, [0] called on the United States and the United Kingdom not to invade without the support of the UN's. In a September 2004 interview on the BBC, when questioned about the legal authority for the 2003 invasion of Iraq, [0] said [0] believed the 2003 invasion of Iraq was not in conformity with the Charter of the UN and was illegal.In 1998, [0] was deeply involved in supporting the transition from military to civilian rule in Nigeria. The following year, [0] supported the efforts of East Timor to secure independence from Indonesia. In 2000, [0] was responsible for certifying Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon, and in 2006, [0] led talks in New York between the presidents of Cameroon and Nigeria, which led to a settlement of the dispute between Cameroon and Nigeria over the Bakassi peninsula.[0] and Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad disagreed sharply on Iran's's nuclear program, on an Iranian exhibition of cartoons mocking the Holocaust, and on the then-upcoming International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust, an Iranian Holocaust denial conference in 2006. During a visit to Iran's instigated by continued Iranian uranium enrichment, [0] said: \"[0] think the tragedy of the Holocaust is an undeniable historical fact and we should really accept the tragedy of the Holocaust and teach people what happened in World War II and ensure the tragedy of the Holocaust is never repeated.[0] supported sending a the UN's peacekeeping mission to Darfur, Sudan. [0] worked with Sudan to accept a transfer of power from the African Union peacekeeping mission to a the UN's one. [0] also worked with several Arab and Muslim countries on women's rights and other topics.Beginning in 1998, [0] convened an annual UN \"Security Council Retreat\" with the 15 states' council representatives. an annual UN \"Security Council Retreat\" was held at the Rockefeller Brothers Fund (RBF) Conference Center at the Rockefeller family estate in Pocantico Hills, New York, and was sponsored by both Rockefeller Brothers Fund (RBF) and the UN.In June 2004, [0] was given a copy of the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) report on the complaint brought by four female workers against Ruud Lubbers, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, for sexual harassment, abuse of authority, and retaliation. The report also reviewed a long-serving staff member's's allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct against Werner Blatter, director of UNHCR personnel. The investigation found Ruud Lubbers, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, guilty of sexual harassment; no mention was made publicly of the other charge against a senior official or two subsequent complaints filed later that year. During The investigation, Ruud Lubbers, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, wrote a letter which some considered a threat to a long-serving staff member'sthe complaint brought by four female workers against Ruud Lubbers, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, for sexual harassment, abuse of authority, and retaliation. On 15 July 2004, [0] cleared Ruud Lubbers, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, of the complaint brought by four female workers against Ruud Lubbers, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, for sexual harassment, abuse of authority, and retaliation, saying the complaint brought by four female workers against Ruud Lubbers, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, for sexual harassment, abuse of authority, and retaliation were not substantial enough legally. The report the UN's Ruud Lubbers, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, was leaked, and sections accompanied by an article by Kate Holt were published in a British newspaper. In February 2005, Ruud Lubbers, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, resigned as head of the the UN's refugee agency, saying Ruud Lubbers, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, wanted to relieve political pressure on [0].In December 2004, reports surfaced that the Secretary-General's son Kojo Annan received payments from the Swiss company Cotecna Inspection SA, which had won a lucrative contract under the UN Oil-for-Food Programme. [0] called for an investigation to look into the complaint brought by four female workers against Ruud Lubbers, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, for sexual harassment, abuse of authority, and retaliation. On 11 November 2005, The Sunday Times agreed to apologise and pay a substantial sum in damages to the Secretary-General's son Kojo Annan, accepting that the complaint brought by four female workers against Ruud Lubbers, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, for sexual harassment, abuse of authority, and retaliation were untrue.[0] appointed the Independent Inquiry Committee, which was led by former US Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker, then the director of the United Nations Association of the US. In [0]'s first interview with the Independent Inquiry Committee, which was led by former US Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker, then the director of the United Nations Association of the US, [0] denied meeting with the Swiss company Cotecna Inspection SA, which had won a lucrative contract under the UN Oil-for-Food Programme. Later in The investigation, [0] recalled having met with the Swiss company Cotecna Inspection SA, which had won a lucrative contract under the UN Oil-for-Food Programme's chief executive Elie-Georges Massey twice. In a final report issued on 27 October, the Independent Inquiry Committee, which was led by former US Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker, then the director of the United Nations Association of the US found insufficient evidence to indict [0] on any illegal actions but did find fault with Benon Sevan, an Armenian-Cypriot national who had worked for the UN for about 40 years. Appointed by [0] to the Oil-For-Food role, Benon Sevan, an Armenian-Cypriot national who had worked for the UN for about 40 years repeatedly asked Iraqis for allocations of oil to the African Middle East Petroleum Company. Benon Sevan, an Armenian-Cypriot national who had worked for the UN for about 40 years's behaviour was \"ethically improper\", Benon Sevan, an Armenian-Cypriot national who had worked for the UN for about 40 years said to reporters. Benon Sevan, an Armenian-Cypriot national who had worked for the UN for about 40 years repeatedly denied the complaint brought by four female workers against Ruud Lubbers, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, for sexual harassment, abuse of authority, and retaliation and argued that Benon Sevan, an Armenian-Cypriot national who had worked for the UN for about 40 years was being made a \"scapegoat\". the March 2000 Millennium Report to the UN Benon Sevan, an Armenian-Cypriot national who had worked for the UN for about 40 years was highly critical of the the UN's management structure and the Security Council oversight. the March 2000 Millennium Report to the UN strongly recommended a new chief operating officer (COO) position to handle the fiscal and administrative responsibilities then under [0]'s office. the March 2000 Millennium Report to the UN listed the Western and Middle Eastern companies that had benefited illegally from the UN Oil-for-Food Programme.", "Nobel Peace Prize": "Kofi Annan is our person to focus on. In 2001, [0]'s centennial year, [0] decided that the Peace Prize was to be divided between the UN and Annan. the UN and Annan were awarded the Peace Prize \"for the UN and Annan's work for a better organized and more peaceful world\", having revitalised the UN and prioritised human rights.

You will lose the United States one way or another.

The interim US ambassador John Bolton, appointed by President George W. Bush, was reported to have told [0] on the phone: \"The interim US ambassador John Bolton, appointed by President George W. Bush've known [0] since 1989 and The interim US ambassador John Bolton, appointed by President George W. Bush'm telling [0] this is the worst mistake by a senior the United States official that The interim US ambassador John Bolton, appointed by President George W. Bush have seen in that entire time.\" Observers from other nations supported his deputy secretary-general Mark Malloch Brown, who openly criticised the United States in a speech on 6 June 2006's view that conservative politicians in the US prevented many citizens from understanding the benefits of US involvement in the United States.", "Farewell addresses": "[0] is our person to focus on. On 19 September 2006, [0] gave a farewell address to world leaders gathered at the UN headquarters in New York in anticipation of [0]'s retirement on 31 December.

[0] also pointed to violence in Africa and the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict as two major issues warranting attention.On 11 December 2006, in [0]'s final speech as secretary-general, delivered at the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library in Independence, Missouri, [0] recalled President Truman's's leadership in the founding of UN. [0] called for the United States to return to President Truman's's multilateralist foreign policies and to follow President Truman's's doctrine that \"the responsibility of the great states is to serve and not dominate the peoples of the world\".
