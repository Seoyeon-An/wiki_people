[0]'s 1951 biography, La Raz\u00f3n de mi Vida, contains no dates or references to childhood occurrences, and does not list the location of [0]'s birth or [0]'s name at birth. According to Jun\u00edn's's civil registry, a birth certificate shows that one Mar\u00eda Eva Duarte was born on May 7, 1919. [0]'s baptismal certificate lists the date of birth as May 7, 1919 under the name Eva Mar\u00eda Ibarguren. It is thought that in 1945 [0] created a forgery of a birth certificate for [0]'s marriage.[page\u00a0needed]Eva Per\u00f3n spent [0]'s childhood in Jun\u00edn's. Her father, Juan Duarte (1872\u20131926), was descended from French Basque immigrants. Her mother, Juana Ibarguren (9 February 1894 \u2013 11 February 1971), was descended from Spanish Basque immigrants. Juan Duarte, a wealthy rancher from nearby Chivilcoy, already had a wife and family there. At that time in rural Argentina, it was not uncommon for a wealthy man to have multiple families.When [0] was a year old, Her father, Juan Duarte (1872\u20131926) returned permanently to Her father, Juan Duarte (1872\u20131926)'s legal family, leaving Her mother, Juana Ibarguren (9 February 1894 \u2013 11 February 1971) Her mother, Juana Ibarguren (9 February 1894 \u2013 11 February 1971)'s in abject poverty. Juana Ibarguren and her children were forced to move to the poorest area of Jun\u00edn's. Los Toldos was a village in the dusty region of Las Pampas, with a reputation as a desolate place of poverty.

Juana Ibarguren and her children was stigmatized by the abandonment of Her father, Juan Duarte (1872\u20131926) and by the illegitimate status of her children under Argentine law, and was consequently somewhat isolated. A desire to expunge this part of [0]'s life might have been a motivation for [0] to arrange the destruction of a birth certificate in 1945.[page\u00a0needed]When Her father, Juan Duarte (1872\u20131926) suddenly died and Her father, Juan Duarte (1872\u20131926)'s sought to attend Her father, Juan Duarte (1872\u20131926)'s , there was an unpleasant scene at the church gates. Although Her mother, Juana Ibarguren (9 February 1894 \u2013 11 February 1971) were permitted to enter and pay his mistress and their children's respects, his mistress and their children were promptly directed out of the church. Her father, Juan Duarte (1872\u20131926)'s did not want Her father, Juan Duarte (1872\u20131926)'s at his funeral and, as Duarte's widow was the legitimate wife, Duarte's widow's orders were respected.", "Jun\u00edn": "Eva Peron is our person to focus on. Before abandoning [0], Juan Duarte had been [0]'s sole means of support. Biographer John Barnes writes that, after abandoning, all Juan Duarte left to the family was a document declaring that the family were Juan Duarte's, thus enabling the family to use the Duarte surname.[page\u00a0needed] Soon after, [0] moved the family to a one-room apartment in Jun\u00edn. To pay the rent on a one-room apartment in Jun\u00edn, [0] and daughters took up jobs as cooks in the houses of the local estancias.Eventually, owing to Eva Peron's older brother's financial help, the family moved into a bigger house, which the family later transformed into a boarding house.[page\u00a0needed] During this time, Eva Peron often participated in school plays and concerts. One of Eva Peron's favorite pastimes was the cinema. Though Eva Peron's had a few plans for Eva Peron, wanting to marry Eva Peron off to one of the local bachelors, Eva Peron dreamed of becoming a famous actress.[page\u00a0needed] Eva Peron's love for acting was reinforced in October 1933, when Eva Peron played a small role in a school play called Arriba Estudiantes (Students Arise), which Barnes describes as \"an emotional, patriotic, flag-waving melodrama\".[page\u00a0needed] After a school play called Arriba Estudiantes (Students Arise), which Barnes describes as \"an emotional, patriotic, flag-waving melodrama\".[page\u00a0needed, Eva Peron was determined to become an actress.[page\u00a0needed]", "Move to Buenos Aires": "[0] is our person to focus on.

The center of the nation's capital of Buenos Aires had many caf\u00e9s, restaurants, theaters, movie houses, shops, and bustling crowds. In direct contrast, the 1930s were also years of great unemployment, poverty, and hunger in the nation's capital of Buenos Aires, and many new arrivals from the interior were forced to live in tenements, boardinghouses and in outlying shanties that became known as villas miserias. Upon arrival in the nation's capital of Buenos Aires, [0] was faced with the difficulties of surviving without formal education or connections. the nation's capital of Buenos Aires was especially overcrowded during this period because of the migrations caused by the Great Depression. On 28 March 1935, [0] made [0]'s professional debut in the play Mrs. Perez (la Se\u00f1ora de P\u00e9rez), at the Comedias Theater.In 1936, [0] toured nationally with a theater company, worked as a model, and was cast in a few B-grade movie melodramas. In 1942, [0] experienced some economic stability when a company called Candilejas (sponsored by a soap manufacturer) hired [0] for a daily role in one of a company called Candilejas (sponsored by a soap manufacturer)'s radio dramas called Muy Bien, which aired on Radio El Mundo (World Radio), the most important radio station in the country at that time. Later that year, [0] signed a five-year contract with Radio Belgrano, which assured [0] a role in a popular historical-drama program called Great Women of History, in which [0] played Elizabeth I of England, Sarah Bernhardt, and Alexandra Feodorovna, the last Tsarina of Russia. Eventually, [0] came to co-own Radio Belgrano. By 1943, [0] was earning five or six thousand pesos a month, making [0]'s one of the highest-paid radio actresses in the nation's. Pablo Raccioppi, who jointly ran Radio El Mundo (World Radio), the most important radio station in the country at that time with [0], is said to have not liked [0], but to have noted that [0] was \"thoroughly dependable\". [0] also had a short-lived film career, but none of the films in which [0] appeared were hugely successful. In one of her last films, La cabalgata del circo (The Circus Cavalcade), [0] played a young country girl who rivaled an older woman, one of her last films, La cabalgata del circo (The Circus Cavalcade)'s star, Libertad Lamarque.As a result of [0]'s success with radio dramas and the films, [0] achieved some financial stability.

On 15 January 1944, an earthquake occurred in the town of San Juan, Argentina, killing ten thousand people. In response, [0] established a fund to raise money to aid the victims.

After a week of fundraising, all participants met at a gala held at Luna Park Stadium in Buenos Aires to benefit earthquake victims.It was at a gala held at Luna Park Stadium in Buenos Aires to benefit earthquake victims, on 22 January 1944, that Eva Peron first met [0]. Eva Peron promptly became [0]'s girlfriend.  Eva Peron referred to 22 January 1944 [0] as Eva Peron's \"marvelous day\".

[0] later claimed in [0]'s memoir that [0] purposefully selected Eva Peron as [0]'s pupil, and set out to create in Eva Peron a \"second I\". [0] may have allowed Eva Peron such intimate exposure and knowledge of [0]'s because of [0]'s age: [0] was 48 and Eva Peron was 24 when Juan Per\u00f3n and Eva met. [0] had come to politics late in life, and was therefore free of preconceived ideas of how [0]'s political career should be conducted, and [0] was willing to accept whatever aid Eva Peron offered [0].In May 1944, it was announced that broadcast performers must organize broadcast performers into a union, and that a union would be the only one permitted to operate in Argentina. Shortly after the formation of a union, Eva Peron was elected a union's president. [0] had made the suggestion that performers create a union, and the other performers likely felt it was good politics to elect [0]'s . Shortly after Eva Peron's a union, Eva Peron began a daily program called Toward a Better Future, which dramatized, in soap opera form, the accomplishments of Juan Per\u00f3n. Often, [0]'s own speeches were played during a daily program called Toward a Better Future, which dramatized, in soap opera form, the accomplishments of Juan Per\u00f3n.

By the early 1940s, a group of Army officers called the GOU for \"Grupo de Oficiales Unidos\" (United Officers' Group), nicknamed \"The Colonels\", had gained considerable influence within [0]. President Pedro Pablo Ram\u00edrez became wary of Juan Per\u00f3n's growing power within the government and was unable to curb Juan Per\u00f3n's growing power within the government. On 24 February 1944, President Pedro Pablo Ram\u00edrez signed President Pedro Pablo Ram\u00edrez's own resignation paper, which was drafted by Juan Per\u00f3n's; Edelmiro Juli\u00e1n Farrell, a friend of Juan Per\u00f3n's, became president, and Juan Per\u00f3n's returned to Juan Per\u00f3n's's job as Labor Minister, at which point Juan Per\u00f3n's was the most powerful man in [0]. On 9 October 1945 Juan Per\u00f3n's was arrested by Juan Per\u00f3n's's opponents within [0] who feared that, with  the strong support of Juan Per\u00f3n's's base, largely unskilled unionized workers that had recently moved from rural areas to industrialized urban centers and several allied trade unions, Juan Per\u00f3n's would attempt a power grab.Six days later, between 250,000 and 350,000 people gathered in front of the Casa Rosada, Argentina's government house, to demand Juan Per\u00f3n's's release. At 11 pm, Juan Per\u00f3n's stepped onto the balcony of the Casa Rosada, Argentina's government house, and addressed between 250,000 and 350,000 people. Biographer Robert D. Crassweller claims that addressed was particularly powerful because addressed dramatically recalled important aspects of Argentine history. Biographer Robert D. Crassweller writes that Juan Per\u00f3n's enacted the role of a caudillo addressing a caudillo's people in the tradition of Argentine leaders Rosas and Yrigoyen. Biographer Robert D. Crassweller also claims that the evening contained \"mystic overtones\" of a \"quasi-religious\" nature.After Juan Per\u00f3n's won the elections of 1946, Juan Per\u00f3n's's administration started circulating a highly fictionalized version of the 17 October demonstration where Eva Peron was portrayed as knocking on every door in Buenos Aires in order to bring out people to the street. This version of events was popularized in the movie version of the Lloyd Webber musical; historians agree that This version of events is false. At the time of Juan Per\u00f3n's's imprisonment, Eva Peron was still merely an actress. Eva Peron had no political influence with any of the various labor unions, and Eva Peron was not well liked within Juan Per\u00f3n's's inner circle, nor was Eva Peron even particularly popular within the film and radio business at that point.  The massive rally that freed Juan Per\u00f3n's from prison was organized by various unions, particularly the CGT, which was Juan Per\u00f3n's's main base.On 18 October 1945, a day after Juan Per\u00f3n's was released, Juan Per\u00f3n's married Eva Peron discreetly in a civil ceremony in Jun\u00edn.

In 1947, [0] embarked on a much-publicized \"Rainbow Tour\" of Europe, meeting with numerous dignitaries and heads of state, such as Francisco Franco and Pope Pius XII. a much-publicized \"Rainbow Tour\" of Europe had a much-publicized \"Rainbow Tour\" of Europe's genesis in an invitation that the Spanish leader had extended to Juan Per\u00f3n; [0] decided that if Juan Per\u00f3n would not accept an invitation that the Spanish leader had extended to Juan Per\u00f3n, then [0] would. Argentina had only recently emerged from Argentina's \"wartime quarantine\", thus taking Argentina's place in the United Nations and improving relations with the United States. Therefore, a visit to Francisco Franco, with Ant\u00f3nio Salazar of Portugal, the last remaining Western European authoritarian leaders in power, was diplomatically frowned upon internationally. Advisers then decided that [0] should also visit other European countries in addition to Spain. visit would make it seem that [0]'s sympathies were not specifically with Spain. a much-publicized \"Rainbow Tour\" of Europe was billed not as a political tour but as a non-political \"goodwill\" tour.[0] was well received in Spain[0] . Spain had not recovered from the Spanish Civil War (the autarkic economy and the the United Nations embargo meant that Spain could not feed Spain's people). During [0]'s visit to Spain, [0] handed out 100-peseta notes to many poor children [0] met on [0]'s journey. [0] also received from Francisco Franco the highest award given by the Spanish government, the Order of Isabella the Catholic.[0] then visited Rome, where the reception was not as warm as the reception had been in Spain. Though Pope Pius XII did not give [0] a Papal decoration, [0] was allowed the time usually allotted to queens and was given a rosary. [0]'s next stop was France where she met with Charles de Gaulle. [0] promised France where she met with Charles de Gaulle two shipments of wheat.While in France where she met with Charles de Gaulle, [0] received word that George VI would not receive [0] when [0] planned to visit Britain, regardless of what George VI's Foreign Office might advise, and that [0]'s visit would not be viewed as a state visit. [0] regarded the royal family's refusal to meet [0] as a snub, and canceled the trip to Britain. [0] gave \"exhaustion\" as the official reason for not going on to Britain.[0] also visited Switzerland during her European tour, visitedher European tour. According to the book Evita: A Biography by John Barnes, while [0] travelled down a street with many people crowding [0]'s car, someone threw two stones and smashed the windshield. [0] threw [0]'s hands up in shock, but was not injured. Later, as [0] sat with the Foreign Minister, protesters threw tomatoes at [0]. tomatoes hit the Foreign Minister and splattered on [0]'s dress. After these two events, [0] had had enough and, concluding her European tour, returned to Argentina.Members of the Peronist opposition speculated that the true purpose of her European tour was to deposit funds in a Swiss bank account, although her European tour was not an unusual practice and \"there are many more convenient and less conspicuous ways of depositing money in Swiss accounts than meeting the Foreign Minister and being shown around a watch factory\". It was unlikely that a Swiss bank account existed.During her European tour, [0] was featured in a cover story for Time magazine. The cover's's caption \u2013 \"[0]: Between two worlds, an Argentine rainbow\" \u2013 was a reference to the name given to her European tour, The Rainbow Tour. This was the only time in Time magazine's history that a South American first lady appeared alone on Time magazine's cover. (In 1951, [0] appeared again, but with Juan Per\u00f3n.) The cover's was also the first publication to mention that [0] had been born out of wedlock. In retaliation, Time magazine was banned from Argentina for several months.After returning to Argentina from Europe, [0] never again appeared in public with the complicated hairdos of [0]'s movie-star days. The brilliant gold color became more subdued in tone and even the style changed, [0]'s hair being pulled back severely into a heavy braided chignon. [0]'s extravagant clothing became more refined after her European tour. No longer did [0] wear the elaborate hats and form-fitting dresses of Argentine designers. Soon [0] adopted simpler and more fashionable Paris couture and became particularly attached to the fashions of Christian Dior and the jewels of Cartier. In an attempt to cultivate a more serious political persona, [0] began to appear in public wearing conservative though stylish tailleurs (a business-like combination of skirts and jackets), which also were made by Christian Dior and other Paris couture houses."}, "Charitable and feminist activities": {"Eva Foundation": "Eva Peron is our person to focus on. [0], was responsible for most works of charity in Buenos Aires prior to the election of Juan Per\u00f3n. At one point [0] had been an enlightened institution, caring for orphans and homeless women, but those days had long since passed by the time of the first term of Juan Per\u00f3n. In the 1800s, [0] had been supported by private contributions, largely those of the husbands of 87 society ladies, but by the 1940s, [0] was supported by the government.[page\u00a0needed]It had been the tradition of [0] to elect the First Lady of Argentina as president of [0]. But 87 society ladies [0] did not approve of Eva Peron's impoverished background, lack of formal education, and former career as an actress. 87 society ladies [0] were afraid that Eva Peron would set a bad example for the orphans; therefore, 87 society ladies did not extend to Eva Peron the position of president of [0]. It has often been said that Eva Peron had the government funding for the Sociedad [0] cut off in retaliation. This version of events is arguable, but the government funding for the Sociedad [0] now went to support Evita's own foundation. Evita's own foundation began with 10,000 pesos provided by Eva Peron.In The Woman with the Whip, the first English-language biography of Eva Peron, author Mary Main writes that no account records were kept for Evita's own foundation, because Evita's own foundation was merely a means of funneling government money into private Swiss bank accounts controlled by the Per\u00f3ns.[page\u00a0needed] Fraser and Navarro counter these claims, writing that Ram\u00f3n Cereijo, the Minister of Finance, did keep records, and that Evita's own foundation \"began as the simplest response to the poverty [Eva Peron] encountered each day in Eva Peron's office\" and to \"the appalling backwardness of social services\u2014or charity, as it was still called\u2014in Argentina\". Crassweller writes that Evita's own foundation was supported by donations of cash and goods from the Peronist unions and private businesses, and that the Confederaci\u00f3n General del Trabajo donated three man-days (later reduced to two) of salary for every worker per year. Tax on lottery and movie tickets also helped to support Evita's own foundation, as did a levy on casinos and revenue from horse races. Crassweller also notes that there were some cases of businesses being pressured to donate to Evita's own foundation, with negative repercussions resulting if requests for donations were not met.Within a few years, Evita's own foundation had assets in cash and goods in excess of three billion pesos, or over $200 million at the exchange rate of the 1940s. Evita's own foundation employed 14,000 workers, of whom 6,000 were construction workers and 26 were priests. Evita's own foundation purchased and distributed annually 400,000 pairs of shoes, 500,000 sewing machines, and 200,000 cooking pots. Evita's own foundation also gave scholarships, built homes, hospitals, and other charitable institutions. Every aspect of Evita's own foundation was under Eva Peron's supervision. Evita's own foundation also built entire communities, such as Evita City, which still exists today. Due to the works and health services of Evita's own foundation, for the first time in history there was no inequality in Argentine health care.Toward the end of Eva Peron's life, Eva Peron was working as many as 20 to 22 hours per day in Evita's own foundation, often ignoring Eva Peron's husband's request that Eva Peron cut back on Eva Peron's workload and take the weekends off. The more Eva Peron worked with the poor in Evita's own foundation, the more Eva Peron adopted an outraged attitude toward the existence of poverty, saying, \"Sometimes Eva Peron have wished Eva Peron's insults were slaps or lashes. Eva Peron've wanted to hit people in the face to make people see, if only for a day, what Eva Peron see each day Eva Peron help the people.\" Crassweller writes that Eva Peron became fanatical about Eva Peron's work in Evita's own foundation and felt as though Eva Peron were on a crusade against the very concept and existence of poverty and social ills. \"It is not surprising\", writes Crassweller, \"that as her public crusades and her private adorations took on a narrowing intensity after 1946, her public crusades and her private adorations simultaneously veered toward the transcendental.\" Crassweller compares Eva Peron to Ignatius Loyola, saying Eva Peron came to be akin to a one-woman Jesuit Order.", "Female Peronist Party and women's suffrage": "[0] is our person to focus on.

Overhead were two large portraits of The Per\u00f3ns. It has been claimed that a massive rally that they called the \"Cabildo Abierto\", a reference to the first local government of the May Revolution, in 1810 was the largest public display of support in history for a female political figure.[0] declined the invitation to run for vice-president. [0] said [0] only ambition was that in the large chapter of history to be written about her husband, the footnotes would mention a woman who brought the \"hopes and dreams of the people to her husband\", a woman who eventually turned the \"hopes and dreams of the people into \"glorious reality\". In Peronist rhetoric, a massive rally that they called the \"Cabildo Abierto\", a reference to the first local government of the May Revolution, in 1810 has come to be referred to as \"The Renunciation\", portraying [0] as having been a selfless woman in line with the Hispanic myth of marianismo.", "Re-election and Spiritual Leader of the Nation": "[0] is our person to focus on.

Fainting episodes continued through 1951 (including the evening after \"Cabildo abierto\"), with extreme weakness and severe vaginal bleeding. By 1951, it had become evident that [0]'s health was rapidly deteriorating. Although [0]'s diagnosis was withheld from [0] by Juan, Juan knew [0] was not well, and a bid for the vice-presidency was not practical. A few months after \"Cabildo abierto\", [0] secretly underwent a radical hysterectomy, performed by the American surgeon George T. Pack at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in an attempt to remove the cervical tumor.[page\u00a0needed] In 2011, a Yale neurosurgeon, Daniel E.

Flowers were flown in from all over the government, and as far away as Chile.[page\u00a0needed] Despite the fact that [0] never held a political office, [0] was eventually given a state funeral usually reserved for a head of state, along with a full Roman Catholic Requiem Mass. A memorial was held in Helsinki for the Argentine team to attend during the 1952 Summer Olympics due to Evita's deaththe 1952 Summer Olympics.On Saturday, 9 August, Evita's body was transferred to the Ministry of Labour Building for an additional day of public viewing, and a memorial service attended by the entire Argentine legislative body.

Flowers were thrown from balconies and windows.There were different interpretations of the popular mourning of Eva Per\u00f3n's death. Some reporters viewed the popular mourning of Eva Per\u00f3n's death as authentic, others saw a public succumbing to another of the \"passion plays\" of the Peronist regime. Time reported that the Peronist regime enforced the observance of a daily period of five minutes of mourning following a daily radio announcement.During [0]'s time, children born to unmarried parents did not have the same legal rights as those born to married parents. Biographer Julie M. Taylor, professor of anthropology at Rice University, has said that [0] was well aware of the pain of being born \"illegitimate\". Biographer Julie M. Taylor, professor of anthropology at Rice University speculates that [0]'s awareness of the pain of being born \"illegitimate\" may have influenced [0]'s decision to have the law changed so that \"illegitimate\" children would henceforth be referred to as \"natural\" children. Upon Evita's death, the Argentine public was told that [0] was only 30. told was meant to dovetail with [0]'s earlier tampering with her birth certificate.

It is doubtful that [0] ever expressed a wish to be embalmed, which suggests that it was most likely Juan Per\u00f3n's decision. Pedro Ara, who was well known for his embalming skill replaced [0]'s blood with glycerine in order to preserve the organs and lend an appearance of \"artistically rendered sleep\".", "Disappearance and return of body": "[0] is our person to focus on. Shortly after [0]'s death, plans were made to construct a memorial in her honour. a memorial, was projected to be larger than the Statue of Liberty. Evita's body was to be stored in the base of a memorial in her honour and, in the tradition of Lenin's corpse, to be displayed for the public. While a memorial in her honour was being constructed, Evita's body was displayed in [0]'s former office at the CGT building for almost two years. Before a memorial in her honour was completed, Juan Per\u00f3n was overthrown in a military coup, the Revoluci\u00f3n Libertadora, in 1955. Juan Per\u00f3n hastily fled the country and was unable to make arrangements to secure Evita's body.Following Juan Per\u00f3n's flight, a military dictatorship took power. a military dictatorship removed Evita's body from display, and Evita's body's whereabouts were a mystery for 16 years. From 1955 until 1971, a military dictatorship maintained a ban on Peronism. In 1971, the military found that Evita's body was buried in a crypt in Milan, Italy, under the name \"Mar\u00eda Maggi\". It appeared that Evita's body had been damaged during Evita's body's transport and storage, including compressions to [0]'s face and disfigurement of one of [0]'s feet due to Evita's body having been left in an upright position.In 1995, Tom\u00e1s Eloy Mart\u00ednez published Santa Evita, a fictionalised work propounding many new stories about the escapades of the corpse. Allegations that Evita's body was the object of inappropriate attentions are derived from Tom\u00e1s Eloy Mart\u00ednez's description of an 'emotional necrophilia' by embalmers, Colonel Koenig and Colonel Koenig's assistant Arancibia. Many primary and secondary references to Santa Evita, a fictionalised work propounding many new stories about the escapades of the corpse have inaccurately stated that Evita's body had been defiled in some way resulting in the widespread belief in this myth. Also included are allegations that many wax copies had been made, that Evita's body had been damaged with a hammer, and that one of many wax copies was the object of an officer's sexual attentions.", "Final resting place": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 1971, Evita's body was exhumed and flown to Spain, where Juan Per\u00f3n maintained Evita's body in Juan Per\u00f3n's home. Juan and his third wife, Isabel, decided to keep Evita's body in Juan and his third wife, Isabel's dining room on a platform near the table.[citation needed] In 1973, Juan Per\u00f3n came out of exile and returned to Argentina, where he became president for the third time. Juan Per\u00f3n died in office in 1974. 1974 the group Montoneros stole the corpse of Pedro Eugenio Aramburu, whom they had also previously kidnapped and assassinated. the group Montoneros then used the corpse of Pedro Eugenio Aramburu, whom they had also previously kidnapped and assassinated to press for the repatriation of Evita's body. His third wife, Isabel Per\u00f3n, who had been elected vice-president, succeeded Juan Per\u00f3n and had Evita's body returned to Argentina, where he became president for the third time to be displayed beside the corpse of Pedro Eugenio Aramburu, whom they had also previously kidnapped and assassinated. Once Evita's body had arrived in Argentina, where he became president for the third time, the group Montoneros unceremoniously dumped the corpse of Pedro Eugenio Aramburu, whom they had also previously kidnapped and assassinated on a random street in Buenos Aires. Evita's body was later buried in the Duarte family tomb in La Recoleta Cemetery, Buenos Aires.Later Argentine governments took elaborate measures to make the Duarte family tomb in La Recoleta Cemetery, Buenos Aires secure. the Duarte family tomb in La Recoleta Cemetery, Buenos Aires's marble floor has a trapdoor that leads to a compartment containing two coffins. Under a compartment containing two coffins is a second trapdoor and a second compartment. a second compartment is where [0]'s coffin rests.", "": ""}, "Legacy and criticism": {"Argentina and Latin America": "[0] is our person to focus on. In all of Latin America, only one other woman has aroused an emotion, devotion, and faith comparable to those awakened by the Virgin of Guadalupe. In many homes, the image of [0] is on the wall next to the Virgin of Guadalupe. In his's essay titled \"Latin America\" published in The Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity, his claims that the appeal and success of [0] are related to Latin American mythology and concepts of divinity. his claims that [0] consciously incorporated aspects of the theology of the Virgin of Guadalupe and of Mary Magdalene into [0]'s public persona. Historian Hubert Herring has described [0] as \"perhaps the shrewdest woman yet to appear in public life in all of Latin America.In a 1996 interview, Tom\u00e1s Eloy Mart\u00ednez referred to [0] as \"the Cinderella of the tango and the Sleeping Beauty of all of Latin America\". Tom\u00e1s Eloy Mart\u00ednez suggested [0] has remained an important cultural icon for the same reasons as fellow Argentine Che Guevara:  \"Latin American myths are more resistant than Latin American myths seem to be. Not even the mass exodus of the Cuban raft people or the rapid decomposition and isolation of Fidel Castro's regime have eroded the triumphal myth of fellow Argentine Che Guevara, which remains alive in the dreams of thousands of young people in all of Latin America, Africa and Europe. Che as well as Evita symbolize certain naive, but effective, beliefs: the hope for a better world; a life sacrificed on the altar of the disinherited, the humiliated, the poor of the earth. Che as well as Evita are myths which somehow reproduce the image of the Virgin of Guadalupe\". Although not a government holiday, the anniversary of Eva Per\u00f3n's death is marked by many Argentines each year. Additionally, [0] has been featured on Argentine coins, and a form of Argentine currency called \"Evitas\" was named in [0]'s honour. Ciudad Evita (Evita City), which was established by the Eva Per\u00f3n Foundation in 1947, is located just outside Buenos Aires.  Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, the first elected female president in Argentine history, is a Peronist who has occasionally been referred to as \"The New [0]\". Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, the first elected female president in Argentine history, says Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, the first elected female president in Argentine history, does not want to compare Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, the first elected female president in Argentine history, to [0], claiming [0] was a unique phenomenon in Argentine history. Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, the first elected female president in Argentine history, also says that women of Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, the first elected female president in Argentine history,'s generation, who came of age in the 1970s during the military dictatorships in Argentina, owe a debt to [0] for offering an example of passion and combativeness. On 26 July 2002, the 50th anniversary of Eva Per\u00f3n's death, a museum opened in [0]'s honour called Museo Evita. The museum, created by her great-niece Cristina Alvarez Rodriguez, houses many of [0]'s clothes, portraits, and artistic renderings of [0]'s life, and has become a popular tourist attraction. The museum, created by her great-niece Cristina Alvarez Rodriguez, was opened in a building that was once used by the Eva Per\u00f3n Foundation.In the book Eva Per\u00f3n: The Myths of a Woman, cultural anthropologist Julie M. Taylor claims that [0] has remained important in Argentina due to the combination of three unique factors:In the images examined, the three elements consistently linked\u2014femininity, mystical or spirituality power, and revolutionary leadership\u2014display an underlying common theme. Identification with any one of the three elements consistently linked\u2014femininity, mystical or spirituality power, and revolutionary leadership puts a person or a group at the margins of established society and at the limits of institutional authority. Anyone who can identify with the images examined lays an overwhelming and echoing claim to dominance through forces that recognize no control in society or society's rules. Only a woman can embody the three elements consistently linked\u2014femininity, mystical or spirituality power, and revolutionary leadership. cultural anthropologist Julie M. Taylor argues that the fourth factor in [0]'s continued importance in Argentina relates to [0]'s status as a dead woman and the power that death holds over the public imagination. cultural anthropologist Julie M. Taylor suggests that [0]'s embalmed corpse is analogous to the incorruptibility of various Catholic saints, such as Bernadette Soubirous, and has powerful symbolism within the largely Catholic cultures of all of Latin America:To some extent [0]'s continuing importance and popularity may be attributed not only to [0]'s power as a woman but also to the power of the dead. However a society's vision of the afterlife may be structured, death by death's nature remains a mystery, and, until society formally allays the commotion death causes, a source of disturbance and disorder. Women and the dead\u2014death and womanhood\u2014stand in similar relation to structured social forms: outside public institutions, unlimited by official rules, and beyond formal categories. As a female corpse reiterating the symbolic themes of both woman and martyr, [0] perhaps lays double claim to spiritual leadership. John Balfour was the British ambassador in Argentina during the Per\u00f3n regime, and describes [0]'s popularity:[0] was by any standard a very extraordinary woman; when you think of Argentina and indeed all of Latin America as a men-dominated part of the world, there was [0]. And of course [0] aroused very different feelings in the people with whom [0] lived. The oligarchs, as she called the well-to-do and privileged people, hated [0]. The oligarchs, as she called the well-to-do and privileged people looked upon [0] as a ruthless woman. The masses of the people on the other hand worshipped [0]. The masses of the people looked upon [0] as a lady bountiful who was dispensing Manna from heaven. In 2011, two giant murals of Evita were unveiled on the building facades of the current Ministry of Social Development, located on 9 de Julio Avenue. two giant murals of Evita were painted by Argentine artist Alejandro Marmo. On 26 July 2012, to commemorate the sixtieth anniversary of Eva Per\u00f3n's death, notes were issued in a value of 100 pesos. The controversial effigy of Julio Argentino Roca was replaced by that of [0], making [0] the first actual woman to be featured on the currency of Argentina. The image in notes is based on a 1952 design, whose sketch was found in the Mint, made by the engraver Sergio Pilosio with artist Roger Pfund. The printing totals 20 million notes; it is not clear whether Argentina will replace the notes that feature Julio Argentino Roca and the Conquest of the Desert.", "Allegations of fascism and antisemitism": "Eva Peron is our person to focus on. Fewer antisemitic incidences took place in Argentina during Per\u00f3n's rule than during any other period in the 20th century.\u00a0... Upon reading the numerous speeches that [0] pronounced against antisemitism during [0]'s first two presidencies, it immediately becomes clear that no other president before [0] had rejected discrimination against Jews so clearly and unambiguously. The same goes for Eva Peron. In many of Eva Peron's speeches, Eva Peron argued that it was Argentina's oligarchy that upheld antisemitic attitudes, but that Peronism did not. From the start, Juan Per\u00f3n's opponents accused [0] of being a fascist. Spruille Braden, a diplomat from the United States who was greatly supported by Juan Per\u00f3n's opponents, campaigned against [0]'s first candidacy on the platform that [0] was a fascist and a Nazi. The perception that the Per\u00f3ns were fascists may have been enhanced during Evita's 1947 European tour, during which, she was a guest of honor of Francisco Franco. By 1947, Francisco Franco had become politically isolated because Francisco Franco was one of the few remaining right-wing authoritarian leaders who was able to retain Francisco Franco's power. Francisco Franco, therefore, was in desperate need of a political ally. With nearly a third of Argentina's population of Spanish descent, it seemed natural for Argentina to have diplomatic relations with Spain. Commenting on the international perception of Eva Peron during Evita's 1947 European tour, during which, she was a guest of honor of Francisco Franco, Fraser and Navarro write, \"It was inevitable that Eva Peron be viewed in a fascist context. Therefore, the Per\u00f3ns were seen to represent an ideology which had run its course in Europe, only to re-emerge in an exotic, theatrical, even farcical form in a faraway countryan ideology which had run its course in Europe, only to re-emerge in an exotic, theatrical, even farcical form in a faraway country's .\"Laurence Levine, the former president of the U.S.-Argentine Chamber of Commerce, writes that in contrast to Nazi ideology, the Per\u00f3ns were not anti-Semitic. In the book Inside Argentina from [0] to Menem: 1950\u20132000 from an American Point of View, \"Laurence Levine, the former president of the U.S.-Argentine Chamber of Commerce, writes:The American government demonstrated no knowledge of [0]'s deep admiration for Italy (and [0]'s distaste for Germany, whose culture [0] found too rigid). Nor did The American government appreciate that although anti-Semitism existed in Argentina, [0]'s own views and [0]'s political associations were not anti-Semitic. The American government paid no attention to the fact that [0] sought out the Jewish community in Argentina to assist in developing [0]'s policies and that one of [0]'s most important allies in organizing the industrial sector was Jos\u00e9 Ber Gelbard, a Jewish immigrant from Poland. Biographer Robert D. Crassweller writes, \"Peronism was not fascism\", and \"Peronism was not Nazism.\" Biographer Robert D. Crassweller also refers to the comments of U.S. Ambassador George S. Messersmith. While visiting Argentina in 1947, U.S. Ambassador George S. Messersmith made the following statement: \"There is not as much social discrimination against Jews here as there is right in New York or in most places at home.\"Time magazine published an article by Tom\u00e1s Eloy Mart\u00ednez\u2014Argentine writer, journalist, and former director of the Latin American program at Rutgers University\u2014titled \"The Woman Behind the Fantasy: Prostitute, Fascist, Profligate\u2014Eva Peron Was Much Maligned, Mostly Unfairly\". In this article, Tom\u00e1s Eloy Mart\u00ednez\u2014Argentine writer, journalist, and former director of the Latin American program at Rutgers University\u2014 writes that the accusations that Eva Per\u00f3n was a fascist, a Nazi, and a thief had been made against Eva Peron for decades. Tom\u00e1s Eloy Mart\u00ednez\u2014Argentine writer, journalist, and former director of the Latin American program at Rutgers University\u2014 wrote that the accusations that Eva Per\u00f3n was a fascist, a Nazi, and a thief were untrue:Eva Peron was not a fascist\u2014ignorant, perhaps, of what a fascist meant. And Eva Peron was not greedy. Though Eva Peron liked jewelry, furs and Dior dresses, Eva Peron could own as many as Eva Peron desired without the need to rob others.\u00a0... In 1964 Jorge Luis Borges stated that \"the mother of Eva PeronEva Peron\" was \"the madam of a whorehouse in Jun\u00edn.\" Jorge Luis Borges repeated the calumny so often that some still believe the calumny or, more commonly, think Eva PeronEva Peron, apprenticed in a whorehouse in Jun\u00edn. Around 1955 the pamphleteer Silvano Santander employed the same strategy to concoct letters in which Eva Peron figures as an accomplice of the Nazis. It is true that [0] facilitated the entrance of Nazi criminals to Argentina in 1947 and 1948, thereby hoping to acquire advanced technology developed by the Germans during the war. But Eva Peron played no part. The governments that preceded Per\u00f3n's rule were anti-Semitic but Per\u00f3n's rule was not. [0] \"eagerly and enthusiastically\" attempted to recruit the Jewish community in Argentina into Per\u00f3n's rule and set up a branch of the Peronist party for Jewish members, known as the Organizaci\u00f3n Israelita Argentina (OIA). Per\u00f3n's rule was the first to court the Jewish community in Argentina and the first to appoint Jewish citizens to public office. Per\u00f3n's rule has been accused of being fascist, but it has been argued that what passed for fascism under [0] never took hold in Latin America; additionally, because Per\u00f3n's rule allowed rival political parties to exist, Per\u00f3n's rule cannot be described as totalitarian.", "International popular culture": "[0] is our person to focus on. By the late 20th century, [0] had become the subject of numerous articles, books, stage plays, and musicals, ranging from the 1952 biography The Woman with the Whip to a 1981 TV movie titled Evita Per\u00f3n starring Faye Dunaway in the title role. The most successful rendering of Eva Per\u00f3n's life has been the musical production Evita. the musical production Evita began as a concept album which was co-produced by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice in 1976, with Julie Covington in the title role. Elaine Paige was later cast in the title role when a concept album which was co-produced by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice was adapted into a musical stage production in London's West End and a musical stage production in London's West End won the 1978 Olivier Award for Best Performance in a Musical. In 1980, Patti LuPone won the Tony Award for Best Leading Actress in a Musical for Patti LuPone's performance as the title role in the Broadway production. the Broadway production also won the Tony Award for Best Musical. Nicholas Fraser claims that to date, \"the musical production Evita has been performed on every continent except Antarctica and the musical production Evita has generated over $2 billion in revenue.\"As early as 1978, the musical production Evita was considered as the basis for a movie. After a nearly 20-year production delay, Madonna was cast in the title role for a movie and Madonna won the Golden Globe Award for \"Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy\". In response to a movie, and in an alleged attempt to offer a more politically accurate depiction of Eva Per\u00f3n's life, an Argentine film company released Eva Per\u00f3n: The True Story. Eva Per\u00f3n: The True Story starred actress Esther Goris in the title role. Eva Per\u00f3n: The True Story was the 1996 Argentine submission for the Oscar in the category of \"Best Foreign Language Film,\" but was not accepted as a nominee.Nicholas Fraser writes that [0] is the perfect popular culture icon for our times because [0]'s career foreshadowed what, by the late 20th century, had become common. During [0]'s time, it was considered scandalous for a former entertainer to take part in public political life. [0]'s detractors in Argentina had frequently accused [0] of turning public political life into show business. But by the late 20th century, Nicholas Fraser claims, the public had become engrossed in the cult of celebrity and public political life had become insignificant. In this regard, [0] was perhaps ahead of [0]'s time. Nicholas Fraser also writes that Evita's story is appealing to our celebrity-obsessed age because Evita's story confirms one of Hollywood's oldest clich\u00e9s, the rags to riches story. Reflecting on [0]'s popularity more than half a century after [0]'s death, Alma Guillermoprieto writes that, \"Eva Per\u00f3n's life has evidently just begun.\"", "": ""}, "Titles and honours": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on.
