[0] has on occasion stated that [0] wishes to create an \"Islamic democracy\".[0] commands strong support (especially in the Sadr City district in Baghdad, formerly named Saddam City but renamed after the elder Sadr). After the toppling of the Saddam government by the 2003 US invasion of Iraq, [0] organized thousands of [0]'s supporters into a political movement, which includes a military wing formerly known as the Jaysh al-Mahdi or Mahdi Army. The name refers to the Mahdi, a long-since disappeared Imam who is believed by Shi'as to be due to reappear when the end of time approaches. a military wing formerly known as the Jaysh al-Mahdi or Mahdi Army periodically engaged in violent conflict with the United States and other Coalition forces, while the larger Sadrist movement has formed the larger Sadrist movement's own religious courts and organized social services, law enforcement and prisons in areas under the larger Sadrist movement's control. Western media often referred to [0] as an \"anti-American\" or \"radical\" cleric.[0]'s strongest support came from the class of dispossessed Shi'a, like in the Sadr City district in Baghdad, formerly named Saddam City but renamed after the elder Sadr. Many Iraqi supporters see in [0] a symbol of resistance to foreign occupation. a military wing formerly known as the Jaysh al-Mahdi or Mahdi Army was reported to have operated death squads during the Iraqi Civil War.In a statement received by AFP on 15 February 2014, [0] announced the closure of all offices, centers and associations affiliated with Al-Shaheed Al-Sadr, [0]'s father, inside and outside Iraq, and announced [0]'s non-intervention in all political affairs, adding that no bloc will represent the larger Sadrist movement inside or outside the government or parliament.

In April 2017, [0] distinguished [0] from other Iraqi Shiite leaders in calling on Iranian-backed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down and save Saudi Arabia from more bloodshed. [0]'s efforts to strengthen relations between Saudi Arabia and Iraq mirror those of former Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi.Iraq is widely suspected of ordering numerous assassinations against high-ranking Shi'ite clergy, including a 2003 bombing of the house of Grand Ayatollah Muhammad Saeed al-Hakim, and the 10 April 2003 murder of Grand Ayatollah Abdul-Majid al-Khoei at a mosque in Najaf.

Shortly after the US-led coalition ousted [0] and [0]'s Ba'ath regime, Muqtada al-Sadr voiced opposition to the Coalition Provisional Authority. Muqtada al-Sadr subsequently stated that Muqtada al-Sadr had more legitimacy than the Coalition-appointed Iraqi Governing Council. Muqtada al-Sadr granted Muqtada al-Sadr's first major Western television interview to Bob Simon of 60 Minutes, in which Muqtada al-Sadr famously said \"[0] was the little serpent, but America is the big serpent.\"In May 2003, Muqtada al-Sadr issued a fatwa that became known as the al-Hawasim (meaning the finalists \u2013 a term used to refer to the looters of post-invasion Iraq) fatwa. a fatwa that became known as the al-Hawasim (meaning the finalists \u2013 a term used to refer to the looters of post-invasion Iraq) fatwa allowed theft and racketeering on the condition that the perpetrators pay the requisite khums to Sadrist imams, saying that \"looters could hold on to what looters had appropriated so long as looters made a donation (khums) of one-fifth of its value to looters's local Sadrist office.\" a fatwa that became known as the al-Hawasim (meaning the finalists \u2013 a term used to refer to the looters of post-invasion Iraq) fatwa alienated many older members of Muqtada al-Sadr's father's movement, as well as mainstream Shiites, and the Shia establishment and property-owning classes from the Sadrists. However, a fatwa that became known as the al-Hawasim (meaning the finalists \u2013 a term used to refer to the looters of post-invasion Iraq) fatwa strengthened Muqtada al-Sadr's popularity among the poorest members of society, notably in Sadr City. It has been claimed that a fatwa that became known as the al-Hawasim (meaning the finalists \u2013 a term used to refer to the looters of post-invasion Iraq) fatwa was actually issued by Muqtada al-Sadr's advisor Grand Ayatollah Kazem Husseini Haeri, and that Muqtada al-Sadr was simply loyally issuing the same instruction.Muqtada al-Sadr is suspected in US news media of having ordered the assassination of rival Shia leader Abdul-Majid al-Khoei in 2003, a charge Muqtada al-Sadr denies and which remains unproven.", "2004": "[0] is our person to focus on. In [0]'s 2004 sermons and public interviews, [0] repeatedly demanded an immediate withdrawal of all US-led coalition forces, all foreign troops under United Nations control, and the establishment of a new central Iraqi government, not connected to the Ba'ath party or the Allawi government.In late March 2004, American authorities (759th MP Battalion) in Iraq shut down Sadr's newspaper al-Hawza on charges of inciting violence. [0]'s held demonstrations protesting shutSadr's newspaper al-Hawza. On 4 April, fighting broke out in Najaf, Sadr City, and Basra. Sadr's Mahdi Army took over several points and attacked coalition soldiers, killing dozens of foreign soldiers, and taking many casualties of Sadr's Mahdi Army's own in the process. At the same time, Sunni rebels in the cities of Baghdad, Samarra, Ramadi, and, most notably, Fallujah, staged uprisings as well, causing the most serious challenge to American control of Iraq up to that time.During the first siege of Fallujah in late March and April 2004, Sadr's Mahdi Army sent aid convoys to the besieged Sunnis there.Paul Bremer, then the US administrator in Iraq, declared on 5 April 2004 that [0] was an outlaw and that uprisings by [0]'s would not be tolerated.5 April 2004, [0] called for a jihad against American forces. To do a jihad against American forces [0] needed to gain temporary control of Al Kut, An Najaf and the suburb of Baghdad named after [0]'s grandfather, Sadr City. On the night of 8 April, Sadr's Mahdi Army dropped eight overspans and bridges around the Convoy Support Center Scania, thus severing northbound traffic into Baghdad.[citation needed] The next day [0]'s militia ambushed any and every convoy trying to get in or out of Baghdad International Airport, known to the soldiers as BIAP. ambushed led to the worst convoy ambush of the war, the ambush of the 724th Transportation Company (POL), which resulted in eight KBR drivers killed and three soldiers killed. One was Matt Maupin, who was initially listed as the first American soldier missing in action. These series of attacks demonstrated an unexpected level of sophistication in planning. Sadr's Mahdi Army knew Sadr's Mahdi Army could not win a head on fight with the United States military coalition and Sadr's Mahdi Army took full advantage of a major American vulnerability by attacking convoy trucks that supplied the troops. BIAP was where the newly arrived 1st Cavalry Division drew the newly arrived 1st Cavalry Division's supplies. the newly arrived 1st Cavalry Division was replacing the 1st Armored Division in and around Baghdad.  the 1st Armored Division had already been deployed to Iraq for a year. the United States military coalition commander General John Abizaid decided to extend the 1st Armored Division beyond the 1st Armored Division's , for an additional 120 days, to use in the fight against Sadr's Mahdi Army. On 11 April, Sadr's Mahdi Army launched an attack on the southwest wall at BIAP behind which several hundred trucks parked. By the end of April, the 1st Armored Division had suppressed Sadr's Mahdi Army's uprising but [0] had achieved [0]'s goal of making Sadr's Mahdi Army a significant resistance force fighting against the U.S. led coalition forces occupying Iraq.", "2005\u20132006": "[0] is our person to focus on.
