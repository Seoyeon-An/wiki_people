[0] was born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, Santa Fe, the third of four children of Jorge Messi, a steel factory manager, and Jorge Messi, a steel factory manager's wife Celia Cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop. On his father's's side, [0] is of Italian and Spanish descent, the great-grandson of immigrants from the north-central Adriatic Marche region of Italy, and on his mother's's side, [0] has primarily Italian ancestry. Growing up in a tight-knit, football-loving family, [0] developed a passion for the sport from an early age, playing constantly with [0]'s older brothers, Rodrigo and Mat\u00edas, and [0]'s cousins, Maximiliano and Emanuel Biancucchi, both of whom became professional footballers. At the age of four [0] joined local club Grandoli, where [0] was coached by his father's, though [0]'s earliest influence as a player came from his maternal grandmother, Celia, who accompanied him to training and matches. [0] was greatly affected by his maternal grandmother, Celia, who accompanied him to training and matches's death, shortly before [0]'s eleventh birthday; since then, as a devout Roman Catholic, [0] has celebrated [0]'s goals by looking up and pointing to the sky in tribute to his maternal grandmother, Celia, who accompanied him to training and matches.\"When you saw [0] you would think: [0] can't play ball.

Due to [0]'s short stature, [0] has a lower centre of gravity than taller players, which gives [0] greater agility, allowing [0] to change direction more quickly and evade opposing tackles; has has led the Spanish media to dub [0] La Pulga At\u00f3mica (\"The Atomic Flea\"). Despite being physically unimposing, [0] possesses significant upper-body strength, which, combined with [0]'s low centre of gravity and resulting balance, aids [0] in withstanding physical challenges from opponents; [0] has consequently been noted for [0]'s lack of diving in a sport rife with playacting. [0]'s short, strong legs allow [0] to excel in short bursts of acceleration while [0]'s quick feet enable [0] to retain control of the ball when dribbling at speed. His former Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola once stated, \"[0] is the only player that runs faster with the ball than [0] does without the ball.\" Although [0] has improved [0]'s ability with [0]'s weaker foot since [0]'s mid-20s, [0] is predominantly a left-footed player; with the outside of his left foot, [0] usually begins dribbling runs, while [0] uses the inside of his left foot to finish and provide passes and assists.A prolific goalscorer, [0] is known for [0]'s finishing, positioning, quick reactions, and ability to make attacking runs to beat the defensive line. [0] also functions in a playmaking role, courtesy of [0]'s vision and range of passing. [0] has often been described as a magician; a conjurer, creating goals and opportunities where seemingly none exist. Moreover, [0] is an accurate free kick and penalty kick taker. As of September 2023, [0] ranks 5th all time in goals scored from direct free kicks with 65, the most among active players. [0] also has a penchant for scoring from chips.[0]'s pace and technical ability enable [0] to undertake individual dribbling runs towards goal, in particular during counterattacks, usually starting from the halfway line or the right side of the pitch. Widely considered to be the best dribbler in the world, and one of the greatest dribblers of all time, with regard to this ability, his former Argentina manager Diego Maradona has said of [0], \"The ball stays glued to [0]'s foot; his former Argentina manager Diego Maradona've seen great players in his former Argentina manager Diego Maradona's career, but his former Argentina manager Diego Maradona've never seen anyone with [0]'s ball control.\" Beyond [0]'s individual qualities, [0] is also a well-rounded, hard-working team player, known for [0]'s creative combinations, in particular with former Barcelona midfielders Xavi and Andr\u00e9s Iniesta.Tactically, [0] plays in a free attacking role; a versatile player, [0] is capable of attacking on either wing or through the centre of the pitch. [0]'s favoured position in childhood was the playmaker behind two strikers, known as the enganche in Argentine football, but [0] began [0]'s career in Spain as a left-winger or left-sided forward. Upon [0]'s first-team debut, [0] was moved onto the right wing by manager Frank Rijkaard; from the right wing, [0] could more easily cut through the defence into the middle of the pitch and curl shots on goal with [0]'s left foot, rather than predominantly cross balls for teammates. Under His former Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola and subsequent managers, [0] most often played in a false nine role; positioned as a centre-forward or lone striker, [0] would roam the centre, often moving deep into midfield and drawing defenders with [0], in order to create and exploit spaces for passes, other teammates' attacking runs off the ball, [0]'s own dribbling runs, or combinations with former Barcelona midfielders Xavi and Andr\u00e9s Iniesta. Under the stewardship of Luis Enrique, [0] initially returned to playing in the right-sided position that characterised much of [0]'s early career in Luis Enrique's 4\u20133\u20133 formation, while [0] was increasingly deployed in a deeper, free playmaking role in later seasons. Under manager Ernesto Valverde, [0] played in a variety of roles. While [0] occasionally continued to be deployed in a deeper role, from which [0] could make runs from behind into the box, or even on the right wing or as a false nine, [0] was also used in a more offensive, central role in a 4\u20132\u20133\u20131, or as a second striker in a 4\u20134\u20132 formation, where [0] was once again given the licence to drop deep, link-up with midfielders, orchestrate [0]'s team's attacking plays, and create chances for [0]'s attacking partner Su\u00e1rez.As [0]'s career advanced, and [0]'s tendency to dribble diminished slightly with age, [0] began to dictate play in deeper areas of the pitch and developed into one of the best passers and playmakers in football history. [0]'s work-rate off the ball and defensive responsibilities also decreased as [0]'s career progressed; by covering less ground on the pitch, and instead conserving [0]'s energy for short bursts of speed, [0] was able to improve [0]'s efficiency, movement, and positional play, and was also able to avoid muscular injuries, despite often playing a large number of matches throughout a particular season on a consistent basis. Indeed, while [0] was injury-prone in [0]'s early career, [0] was later able to improve [0]'s injury record by running less off the ball, and by adopting a stricter diet, training regime, and sleep schedule. With the Argentina national team, [0] has similarly played anywhere along the frontline; under various managers, [0] has been employed on the right wing, as a false nine, as an out-and-out striker, in a supporting role alongside another forward, or in a deeper, free creative role as a classic number 10 playmaker or attacking midfielder behind the strikers.", "Reception and comparisons to Diego Maradona": "Lionel Messi is our person to focus on. \"[0] have seen the player who will inherit my place in Argentinian football and the player who will inherit my place in Argentinian football's name is Messi.\"\u2013 [0] hailing the player who will inherit my place in Argentinian football as [0]'s successor in February 2006A prodigious talent as a teenager, the player who will inherit my place in Argentinian football established the player who will inherit my place in Argentinian football among the world's's best players before age 20.
