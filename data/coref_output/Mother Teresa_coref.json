[0] was baptised in Skopje, Ottoman Empire (now the capital of North Macedonia) the day after her birth. [0] later considered the day after her birth, [0]'s \"true birthday\".[0] was the youngest child of Nikoll\u00eb and Dranafile Bojaxhiu (Bernai).

Nikoll\u00eb and Dranafile Bojaxhiu (Bernai) may have been from a village near Gjakova, believed by Nikoll\u00eb and Dranafile Bojaxhiu (Bernai)'s offspring to be Bishtazhin.According to a biography by Joan Graff Clucas, [0] was in [0]'s early years when [0] became fascinated by stories of the lives of missionaries and missionaries's service in Bengal; by age 12, [0] was convinced that [0] should commit [0] to religious life. [0]'s resolve strengthened on 15 August 1928 as [0] prayed at the shrine of the Black Madonna of Vitina-Letnice, where [0] often went on pilgrimages.[0] left home in 1928 at age 18 to join the Sisters of Loreto at Loreto Abbey in Rathfarnham, Ireland, to learn English with the intent of becoming a missionary; English was the language of instruction of the Sisters of Loreto in India.

Although [0] enjoyed teaching at the Loreto convent school in Entally, eastern Calcutta, [0] was increasingly disturbed by the poverty surrounding [0] in Calcutta. The Bengal famine of 1943 brought misery and death to Calcutta, and the August 1946 Direct Action Day began a period of Muslim-Hindu violence.In 1946, during a visit to Darjeeling, in the lower Himalayas, where she learned Bengali and taught at St. Teresa's School near her convent by train, [0] felt that [0] heard the call of [0]'s inner conscience to serve the poor of India for Jesus.

On 10 September 1946, [0] experienced what [0] later described as \"the call within the call\" when [0] travelled by train to the Loreto convent in Darjeeling from Calcutta for [0]'s annual retreat. \"[0] was to leave the Loreto convent in Darjeeling and help the poor while living among the poor. It was an order. To fail would have been to break the faith.\" Joseph Langford later wrote, \"Though no one knew it at the time, [0] had just become [0].[0] began missionary work with the poor in 1948, replacing [0]'s traditional Loreto habit with a simple, white cotton sari with a blue border. [0] adopted Indian citizenship, spent several months in Patna to receive basic medical training at Holy Family Hospital and ventured into the slums. [0] founded a school in Motijhil, Calcutta, before [0] began tending to the poor and hungry. At the beginning of 1949, [0] was joined in [0]'s effort by a group of young women, and [0] laid the foundation for a new religious community helping the \"poorest among the poor\".[0]'s efforts quickly caught the attention of Indian officials, including the prime minister. [0] wrote in [0]'s diary that [0]'s first year was fraught with difficulty. With no income, [0] begged for food and supplies and experienced doubt, loneliness and the temptation to return to the comfort of convent life during these early months:Our Lord wants [0] to be a free nun covered with the poverty of the cross. Today, [0] learned a good lesson. The poverty of the poor must be so hard for the poor. While looking for a home [0] walked and walked till [0]'s arms and legs ached. [0] thought how much the poor must ache in body and soul, looking for a home, food and health. Then, the comfort of Loreto [[0]'s former congregation] came to tempt [0]. \"[0] have only to say the word and all that will be [0]'s again\", [0] kept on saying.\u00a0...

In [0]'s words, a new religious community helping the \"poorest among the poor\" would care for \"the hungry, the naked, the homeless, the crippled, the blind, the lepers, all those people who feel unwanted, unloved, uncared for throughout society, people that have become a burden to the society and are shunned by everyone\".In 1952, [0] opened her first hospice with help from Calcutta officials. [0] converted an abandoned Hindu temple into her first hospice, and renamed her first hospice Kalighat, the Home of the Pure Heart (Nirmal Hriday).

[0] then expanded a new religious community helping the \"poorest among the poor\" abroad, opening a house in Venezuela in 1965 with five sisters. Houses followed in Italy (Rome), Tanzania and Austria in 1968, and, during the 1970s, a new religious community helping the \"poorest among the poor\" opened houses and foundations in the United States and dozens of countries in Asia, Africa and Europe.The Missionaries of Charity Brothers was founded in 1963, and a contemplative branch of the Missionaries of Charity followed in 1976.

Responding to requests by many priests, in 1981, [0] founded the Corpus Christi Movement for Priests and with Joseph Langford founded the Missionaries of Charity Fathers in 1984 to combine the vocational aims of the Missionaries of Charity with the resources of the priesthood.By 1997, the Missionaries of Charity Fathers had grown to more than 4,000 sisters who managed orphanages, AIDS hospices and charity centers worldwide, caring for refugees, the blind, disabled, aged, alcoholics, the poor and homeless and victims of floods, epidemics and famine.

Aroup Chatterjee, a physician born and raised in Calcutta who was an activist in the city's slums for years around 1980 before moving to the UK's research, involving more than 100 interviews with volunteers, nuns and others familiar with the sisters of Missionaries of Charity, was described in a 2003 book critical of [0]. Aroup Chatterjee, a physician born and raised in Calcutta who was an activist in the city's slums for years around 1980 before moving to the UK criticized [0] for promoting a \"cult of suffering\" and a distorted, negative image of Calcutta, exaggerating work done by [0]'s mission and misusing funds and privileges at [0]'s disposal.

Vishwa Hindu Parishad, however, opposed the government decision to grant [0] a state funeral. Secretary Giriraj Kishore said that \"[0]'s first duty was to the Church and social service was incidental\", accusing [0] of favouring Christians and conducting \"secret baptisms\" of the dying. In a front-page tribute, the Indian fortnightly Frontline dismissed the charges as \"patently false\" and said that the charges had \"made no impact on the public perception of [0]'s work, especially in Calcutta\". Praising [0] \"selfless caring\", energy and bravery, the author of the tribute criticised [0]'s public campaign against abortion and [0]'s claim to be non-political.In February 2015 Mohan Bhagwat, leader of the Hindu right-wing organisation Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, said that [0]'s objective was \"to convert the person, who was being served, into a Christian\".

Malcolm Muggeridge's was undergoing a spiritual journey of Malcolm Muggeridge's's own at the time. During filming, footage shot in poor lighting (particularly at the Home for the Dying) was thought unlikely to be usable by the crew; the crew had been using new, untested photographic film. In England, footage shot in poor lighting (particularly at the Home for the Dying) was found to be extremely well-lit and Malcolm Muggeridge's called footage shot in poor lighting (particularly at the Home for the Dying) a miracle of \"divine light\" from [0]. Other crew members said that footage shot in poor lighting (particularly at the Home for the Dying) was due to a new type of ultra-sensitive Kodak film. Malcolm Muggeridge's later converted to Catholicism.Around this time, the Catholic world began to honour [0] publicly.
