On December 1, 1955, in MontgomeryAlabama, [0] rejected bus driver James F. Blake's order to vacate a row of four seats in the \"colored\" section in favor of a White passenger, once the \"White\" section was filled. [0] was not the first person to resist bus segregation, but NAACP believed that [0] was the best candidate for seeing through a court challenge after [0]'s arrest for civil disobedience in violating Alabama segregation laws, and [0] helped inspire the Black community to the Montgomery bus boycott the Montgomery buses for over a year. The case became bogged down in the state courts, but the federal Montgomery bus lawsuit Browder v. Gayle resulted in a November 1956 decision that bus segregation is unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.[0]'s and the Montgomery bus boycott became important symbols of the civil rights movement.

[0] was born Rosa Louise McCauley in Tuskegee, Alabama, on February 4, 1913, to Leona (n\u00e9e Edwards), a teacher, and James McCauley, a carpenter. In addition to African ancestry, one of [0]'s great-grandfathers was Scots-Irish and one of [0]'s great-grandmothers a part-Native American slave. As a child, [0] suffered from chronic tonsillitis and was often bedridden; the family could not afford to pay for an operation to address chronic tonsillitis.:\u200a12\u200a When [0]'s parents separated, [0] moved with Leona (n\u00e9e Edwards), a teacher, to [0]'s grandparents' farm outside Pine Level, where [0]'s younger brother Sylvester was born.:\u200a12\u201313\u200a [0] joined the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME), a century-old independent Black denomination founded by free Blacks in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in the early nineteenth century, and remained a member throughout [0]'s life.:\u200a6\u200aMcCauley attended rural schools until the age of eleven. Before the age of eleven, Leona (n\u00e9e Edwards), a teacher, taught McCauley \"a good deal about sewing\". McCauley started piecing quilts from around the age of six, as Leona (n\u00e9e Edwards), a teacher, were making quilts, McCauley put McCauley first quilt together by McCauley around the age of ten, which was unusual, as quilting was mainly a family activity performed when there was no field work or chores to be done. McCauley learned more sewing in school from the age of eleven; McCauley sewed McCauley's own \"first dress [McCauley] could wear\". As a student at the Industrial School for Girls in Montgomery from 1925 to 1928, McCauley took academic and vocational courses. As the Industrial School for Girls in Montgomery closed in 1928, McCauley tranferred to at Booker T. Washington Junior High School for McCauley's final year.:\u200a10\u200a [0] went on to a laboratory school set up by the Alabama State Teachers College for Negroes for secondary education, but dropped out to care for her mother and grandmotherLeona (n\u00e9e Edwards), a teacher,, after her mother and grandmother became ill.:\u200a23\u201327\u200aAround the turn of the 20th century, the former Confederate states had adopted new constitutions and electoral laws that effectively disenfranchised Black voters and, in Alabama, many poor White voters as well. Under the White-established Jim Crow laws, passed after Democrats regained control of southern legislatures, racial segregation was imposed in public facilities and retail stores in the South, including public transportation. Bus and train companies enforced seating policies with separate sections for Blacks and Whites. School bus transportation was unavailable in any form for Black schoolchildren in the South, and Black education was always underfunded.[0] recalled going to elementary school in Pine Level, where school buses took White students to White students's new school and Black students had to walk to Black students:I'd see the bus pass every day ... But to [0], that was a way of life; we had no choice but to accept what was the custom. The bus was among the first ways [0] realized there was a Black world and a White world. Although [0]'s autobiography recounts early memories of the kindness of White strangers, [0] could not ignore the racism of [0]'s society. When the Ku Klux Klan marched down the street in front of the family's house, [0] recalls [0] grandfather guarding the front door with a shotgun. the Industrial School for Girls in Montgomery was burned twice by arsonists. the Industrial School for Girls in Montgomery's faculty was ostracized by the White community.Repeatedly bullied by White children in [0]'s neighborhood, [0] often fought back physically. [0] later said: \"As far back as [0] remember, [0] could never think in terms of accepting physical abuse without some form of retaliation if possible.\":\u200a208\u200a", "Early activism": "[0]  is our person to focus on. In 1932, [0] married Raymond Parks, a barber from Montgomery.:\u200a13,\u200a15\u200a Raymond Parks, a barber from Montgomery was a member of the NAACP, which at the time was collecting money to support the defense of the Scottsboro Boys, a group of Black men falsely accused of raping two White women.:\u200a690\u200a [0] took numerous jobs, ranging from domestic worker to hospital aide. At Raymond Parks, a barber from Montgomery's urging, [0] finished [0]'s high school studies in 1933, at a time when fewer than 7% of African Americans had a high-school diploma.In December 1943, [0] became active in the civil rights movement, joined the Montgomery chapter of the NAACP, and was elected secretary at a time when secretary was considered a woman's job. [0] later said, \"[0] was the only woman there, and the Montgomery chapter of the NAACP needed a secretary, and [0] was too timid to say no.\" [0] continued as secretary until 1957. [0] worked for the local NAACP leader Edgar Nixon, even though the local NAACP leader Edgar Nixon maintained that \"Women don't need to be nowhere but in the kitchen.\" When [0] asked, \"Well, what about [0]?\", the local NAACP leader Edgar Nixon replied: \"the local NAACP leader Edgar Nixon need a secretary and [0] are a good one.\"In 1944, in [0]'s capacity as secretary, [0] investigated the gang-rape of Recy Taylor, a Black woman from Abbeville, Alabama. [0] and other civil rights activists organized \"The Committee for Equal Justice for Recy Taylor, a Black woman from Abbeville, Alabama\", launching what the Chicago Defender called \"the strongest campaign for equal justice to be seen in a decade\". [0] continued [0]'s work as an anti-rape activist five years later when [0] helped organize protests in support of Gertrude Perkins, a Black woman who was raped by two White Montgomery police officers.Although never a member of the Communist Party, [0] attended meetings with Raymond Parks, a barber from Montgomery. The notorious Scottsboro case had been brought to prominence by the Communist Party.In the 1940s, [0] and Raymond Parks, a barber from Montgomery were members of the League of Women Voters. Sometime soon after 1944, [0] held a brief job at Maxwell Air Force Base, which, despite its location in Montgomery, Alabama, did not permit racial segregation because it was federal propertyMaxwell Air Force Base, which, despite its location in Montgomery, Alabama, did not permit racial segregation because it was federal property's Maxwell Air Force Base, which, despite its location in Montgomery, Alabama, did not permit racial segregation because it was federal property . [0] rode on Maxwell Air Force Base, which, despite its location in Montgomery, Alabama, did not permit racial segregation because it was federal property's integrated trolley. Speaking to [0]'s biographer, [0] noted, \"You might just say Maxwell Air Force Base, which, despite its location in Montgomery, Alabama, did not permit racial segregation because it was federal property opened [0]'s eyes up.\" [0] worked as a housekeeper and seamstress for Clifford and Virginia Durr, a White couple. Politically liberal, Clifford and Virginia Durr, a White couple became [0]'s friends. Clifford and Virginia Durr, a White couple encouraged\u2014and eventually helped sponsor\u2014[0] in the summer of 1955 to attend the Highlander Folk School, an education center for activism in workers' rights and racial equality in Monteagle, Tennessee. There [0] was mentored by the veteran organizer Septima Clark. In 1945, despite the Jim Crow laws and discrimination by registrars, [0] succeeded in registering to vote on [0]'s third try.:\u200a690\u200aIn August 1955, Black teenager Emmett Till was brutally murdered after reportedly flirting with a young White woman while visiting relatives in Mississippi. On November 27, 1955, four days before [0] would make [0] stand on the bus, [0] attended a mass meeting at Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery that addressed The notorious Scottsboro case, as well as the recent murders of the activists George W. Lee and Lamar Smith. The featured speaker was T. R. M. Howard, a Black civil rights leader from Mississippi who headed the Regional Council of Negro Leadership. T. R. M. Howard, a Black civil rights leader from Mississippi who headed the Regional Council of Negro Leadership brought news of the recent acquittal of the two men who had murdered Till. [0] was deeply saddened and angry at news of the recent acquittal of the two men who had murdered Till, particularly because Black teenager Emmett Till's had garnered much more attention than any of the cases [0] and the NAACP had worked on\u2014and yet, the two men who had murdered Till still walked free."}, "Parks arrest and bus boycott": {"Montgomery buses: law and prevailing customs": "Rosa Parks  is our person to focus on. In 1900, Montgomery had passed a city ordinance to segregate bus passengers by race. Conductors were empowered to assign seats to achieve [0]. According to a city ordinance to segregate bus passengers by race, no passenger would be required to move or give up no passenger's seat and stand if the bus was crowded and no other seats were available. Over time and by custom, however, Montgomery bus drivers adopted the practice of requiring Black riders to move when there were no White-only seats left.The first four rows of seats on each Montgomery bus were reserved for Whites. Buses had \"colored\" sections for Black people generally in the rear of the bus, although Blacks composed more than 75% of the ridership. \"colored\" sections for Black people generally in the rear of the bus were not fixed but were determined by placement of a movable sign. Black people could sit in the middle rows until the White section filled. If more Whites needed seats, Blacks were to move to seats in the rear, stand, or, if there was no room, leave the bus.Black people could not sit across the aisle in the same row as White people. The driver could move a movable sign, or remove a movable sign altogether. If White people were already sitting in the front, Black people had to board at the front to pay the fare, then disembark and reenter through the rear door.For years, the Black community had complained that the situation was unfair. Rosa Parks said, \"Rosa Parks's resisting being mistreated on the bus did not begin with that particular arrest. Rosa Parks did a lot of walking in Montgomery.\"One day in 1943, Rosa Parks boarded a bus and paid the fare. Rosa Parks then moved to a seat, but driver James F. Blake told Rosa Parks to follow city rules and enter a bus again from the back door. When Rosa Parks exited a bus, driver James F. Blake drove off without Rosa Parks. Rosa Parks waited for the next bus, determined never to ride with driver James F. Blake again.", "Refusal to move": "[0]  is our person to focus on. After working all day, [0] boarded the Cleveland Avenue bus, a General Motors Old Look bus belonging to the Montgomery City Lines, around 6\u00a0pm, Thursday, December 1, 1955, in downtown Montgomery. [0] paid [0]'s fare and sat in an empty seat in the first row of back seats reserved for Blacks in the \"colored\" section. Near the middle of the Cleveland Avenue bus, a General Motors Old Look bus belonging to the Montgomery City Lines, the first row of back seats reserved for Blacks in the \"colored\" section was directly behind the ten seats reserved for White passengers.Initially, [0] did not notice that the bus driver was the same man, James F. Blake, who had left [0] in the rain in 1943. As the Cleveland Avenue bus, a General Motors Old Look bus belonging to the Montgomery City Lines traveled along the Cleveland Avenue bus, a General Motors Old Look bus belonging to the Montgomery City Lines's regular route, all of the White-only seats in the Cleveland Avenue bus, a General Motors Old Look bus belonging to the Montgomery City Lines filled up. the Cleveland Avenue bus, a General Motors Old Look bus belonging to the Montgomery City Lines reached the third stop in front of the Empire Theater, and several White passengers boarded. the bus driver noted that two or three White passengers were standing, as the front of the Cleveland Avenue bus, a General Motors Old Look bus belonging to the Montgomery City Lines had filled to capacity.the bus driver moved the \"colored\" section sign behind [0] and demanded that four Black people give up their seats in the middle section so that several White passengers could sit. Years later, in recalling the events of Thursday, December 1, 1955, [0] said, \"When the bus driver stepped back toward four Black people, when the bus driver waved the bus driver's hand and ordered four Black people up and out of their seats in the middle section, [0] felt a determination cover [0]'s body like a quilt on a winter night.\"By [0]'s account, the bus driver said, \"Y'all better make it light on Y'all and let the bus driver have their seats in the middle section.\" Three of them complied. [0] said, \"the bus driver wanted four Black people to stand up, four Black people. four Black people didn't move at the beginning, but the bus driver says, 'Let the bus driver have their seats in the middle section.' And Three of them moved, but [0] didn't.\" The Black man sitting next to her gave up The Black man sitting next to her's seat.[0] moved, but toward the window seat; [0] did not get up to move to the \"colored\" section. [0] later said about being asked to move to the rear of the Cleveland Avenue bus, a General Motors Old Look bus belonging to the Montgomery City Lines, \"[0] thought of Emmett Till\u2014a 14-year-old African American who was lynched in Mississippi in 1955, after being accused of offending a White woman in her family's grocery store, whose killers were tried and acquitted\u2014and [0] just couldn't go back.the bus driver said, \"Why don't [0] stand up?\" [0] responded, \"[0] don't think [0] should have to stand up.\" the bus driver called the police to arrest [0]. When recalling the incident for Eyes on the Prize, a 1987 public television series on the Civil Rights Movement, [0] said, \"When the bus driver saw [0] still sitting, the bus driver asked if [0] was going to stand up, and [0] said, 'No, [0]'m not.' And the bus driver said, 'Well, if [0] don't stand up, the bus driver'm going to have to call the police and have [0] arrested.' [0] said, 'the bus driver may do call.'\"During a 1956 radio interview with Sydney Rogers in West Oakland several months after [0]'s , [0] said [0] had decided, \"[0] would have to know for once and for all what rights [0] had as a human being and a citizen.\"In [0]'s autobiography, My Story, [0] said:People always say that [0] didn't give up [0]'s seat because [0] was tired, but that isn't true. [0] was not tired physically, or no more tired than [0] usually was at the end of a working day. [0] was not old, although some people have an image of [0] as being old then. [0] was forty-two. No, the only tired [0] was, was tired of giving in. When [0] refused to give up their seats in the middle section, a police officer arrested [0]. As a police officer took [0] away, [0] recalled that [0] asked, \"Why do a police officer push us around?\" [0] remembered a police officer saying, \"a police officer don't know, but the law's the law, and [0]'re under arrest.\" [0] later said, \"[0] only knew that, as [0] was being arrested, that it was the very last time that [0] would ever ride in humiliation of this kind. ... \"[0] was charged with a violation of Chapter 6, Section 11, segregation law of the Montgomery City code, although technically [0] had not taken a White-only seat; [0] had been in a colored section. Edgar Nixon, president of the Montgomery chapter of the NAACP and leader of the Pullman Porters Union, and [0]'s friend Clifford Durr bailed [0] out of jail that evening.[0] did not originate the idea of protesting segregation with a bus sit-in. Those preceding [0] included Bayard Rustin in 1942, Irene Morgan in 1946, Lillie Mae Bradford in 1951, Sarah Louise Keys in 1952,[citation needed] and the members of the ultimately successful Browder v. Gayle 1956 lawsuit (Claudette Colvin, Aurelia Browder, Susie McDonald, and Mary Louise Smith) who were arrested in Montgomery for not giving up Claudette Colvin, Aurelia Browder, Susie McDonald, and Mary Louise Smith's bus seats months before Parks.", "Montgomery bus boycott": "[0]  is our person to focus on. Nixon conferred with Jo Ann Robinson, an Alabama State College professor and member of the Women's Political Council (WPC), about the [0] case. Jo Ann Robinson, an Alabama State College professor and member of the Women's Political Council (WPC) believed it important to seize the opportunity and stayed up all night mimeographing over 35,000 handbills announcing a bus boycott. the Women's Political Council (WPC) was the first group to officially endorse a bus boycott.On Sunday, December 4, 1955, plans for a bus boycott were announced at Black churches in the area, and a front-page article in the Montgomery Advertiser helped spread the word. At a church rally that night, those attending agreed unanimously to continue a bus boycott until those attending were treated with the level of courtesy those attending expected, until Black drivers were hired, and until seating in the middle of the bus was handled on a first-come basis.The next day, [0] was tried on charges of disorderly conduct and violating a local ordinance. tried lasted 30 minutes. After being found guilty and fined $10, plus $4 in court costs (combined total equivalent to $153 in 2022), [0] appealed [0]'s conviction and formally challenged the legality of racial segregation. In a 1992 interview with National Public Radio's Lynn Neary, [0] recalled:[0] did not want to be mistreated, [0] did not want to be deprived of a seat that [0] had paid for. It was just time ... there was opportunity for [0] to take a stand to express the way [0] felt about being treated in that manner. [0] had not planned to get arrested. [0] had plenty to do without having to end up in jail. But when [0] had to face that decision, [0] didn't hesitate to do so because [0] felt that we had endured that too long. The more we gave in, the more we complied with that kind of treatment, the more oppressive that kind of treatment became. On the day of [0]'s \u2014December 5, 1955\u2014the Women's Political Council (WPC) distributed over 35,000 handbills announcing a bus boycott. The handbill read,the Women's Political Council (WPC) are ... asking every Negro to stay off the buses Monday in protest of the arrest and trial ... You can afford to stay out of school for one day. If you work, take a cab, or walk. But please, children and grown-ups, don't ride the bus at all on Monday. Please stay off the buses Monday. It rained Monday, but the Black community persevered in the Black community's . Some rode in carpools, while others traveled in Black-operated cabs that charged the same fare as the bus, 10 cents (equivalent to $1.09 in 2022). Most of the remainder of the 40,000 Black commuters walked, some as far as 20 miles (30\u00a0km).That evening after the success of a bus boycott, a group of 16 to 18 people gathered at the Mt. Zion AME Zion Church to discuss boycott strategies. At that time, [0] was introduced but not asked to speak, despite a standing ovation and calls from a group of 16 to 18 people for [0] to speak; when [0] asked if [0] should say something, the reply was, \"Why, [0]'ve said enough.\" This movement also sparked riots leading up to the 1956 Sugar Bowl.a group of 16 to 18 people agreed that a new organization was needed to lead a bus boycott if a bus boycott were to continue. Rev. Ralph Abernathy suggested the name \"Montgomery Improvement Association\" (MIA).:\u200a432\u200a the name \"Montgomery Improvement Association\" (MIA) was adopted, and the name \"Montgomery Improvement Association\" (MIA) was formed. the name \"Montgomery Improvement Association\" (MIA)'s elected as Its members's president Martin Luther King Jr., a relative newcomer to Montgomery, who was a young and mostly unknown minister of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church.That Monday night, 50 leaders of the African-American community gathered to discuss actions to respond to Parks's arrest. Edgar Nixon, the president of the NAACP, said, \"My God, look what segregation has put in Edgar Nixon, the president of the NAACP,'s hands!\" [0] was considered the ideal plaintiff for a test case against city and state segregation laws, as [0] was seen as a responsible, mature woman with a good reputation. [0] was securely married and employed, was regarded as possessing a quiet and dignified demeanor, and was politically savvy.

Holding together a boycott for years would have been a great strain. In the end, Black residents of Montgomery continued a bus boycott for 381 days. Dozens of public buses stood idle for months, severely damaging the bus transit company's finances, until Montgomery repealed its law requiring segregation on public buses following the US Supreme Court ruling in Browder v. Gayle that it was unconstitutional. [0] was not included as a plaintiff in the US Supreme Court ruling in Browder v. Gayle that it was unconstitutional because the attorney Fred Gray concluded the courts would perceive they were attempting to circumvent [0]'s prosecution on [0]'s charges working their way through the Alabama state court system.[0] played an important part in raising international awareness of the plight of African Americans and the civil rights struggle.
