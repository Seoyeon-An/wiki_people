{"summary": {"": "Woodrow Wilson  is our person to focus on. [0] (December 28, 1856\u00a0\u2013 February 3, 1924) was an American politician and academic who served as the 28th president of the United States from 1913 to 1921. A member of the Democratic Party, [0] served as the president of Princeton University and as the governor of New Jersey before winning the 1912 presidential election. As president, [0] changed the United States's economic policies and led the United States into World War I in 1917. [0] was the leading architect of the League of Nations, and [0]'s progressive stance on foreign policy came to be known as Wilsonianism.Born in Staunton, Virginia, [0] grew up in the American South, mainly in Augusta, Georgia, during the Civil War and Reconstruction. After earning a Ph.D. in history and political science from Johns Hopkins University, [0] taught at various colleges before becoming the president of Princeton University and a spokesman for progressivism in higher education. As governor of New Jersey from 1911 to 1913, [0] broke with party bosses and won the passage of several progressive reforms. To win the presidential nomination [0] mobilized progressives and Southerners to [0]'s cause at the 1912 Democratic National Convention. [0] defeated incumbent Republican William Howard Taft and third-party nominee Theodore Roosevelt to easily win the 1912 presidential election, becoming the first Southerner to do so since 1848. During [0]'s first year as president, [0] authorized the widespread imposition of segregation inside the federal bureaucracy. [0] ousted many African Americans from federal posts and [0]'s opposition to women's suffrage drew protests. [0]'s first term was largely devoted to pursuing passage of [0]'s progressive New Freedom domestic agenda. [0]'s first major priority was the Revenue Act of 1913, which lowered tariffs and began the modern income tax. [0] also negotiated the passage of the Federal Reserve Act, which created the Federal Reserve System. Two major laws, the Federal Trade Commission Act and the Clayton Antitrust Act, were enacted to promote business competition and combat extreme corporate power.At the outbreak of World War I in 1917 in 1914, the United States declared neutrality as [0] tried to negotiate a peace between the Allied and Central Powers. [0] narrowly won re-election in the 1916 United States presidential election, boasting how [0] kept the United States out of wars in Europe and Mexico. In April 1917, [0] asked Congress for a declaration of war against Germany in response to Germany's policy of unrestricted submarine warfare that sank American merchant ships. [0] nominally presided over war-time mobilization and left military matters to the generals. [0] instead concentrated on diplomacy, issuing the Fourteen Points that the Allies and Germany accepted as a basis for post-war peace. [0] wanted the off-year elections of 1918 to be a referendum endorsing [0]'s , but instead the Democratic Party took control of Congress. After the Allied victory in November 1918, [0] went to Paris where he and the British and French leaders dominated the Paris Peace Conference. [0] successfully advocated for the establishment of a multinational organization, the League of Nations. the establishment of a multinational organization, the League of Nations was incorporated into the Treaty of Versailles that he signed. [0] had refused to bring any leading Republican into the Paris where he and the British and French leaders dominated the Paris Peace Conference talks, and back home [0] rejected a Republican compromise that would have allowed the Senate to ratify the Treaty of Versailles that he signed and join a multinational organization, the League of Nations.[0] had intended to seek a third term in office but suffered a severe stroke in October 1919 that left [0] incapacitated. [0]'s wife and [0]'s doctor controlled [0], and no significant decisions were made. Meanwhile, [0]'s alienated German- and Irish-American Democrats and the Democratic Party won a landslide in the 1920 presidential election. Scholars have generally ranked [0] in the upper tier of U.S. presidents, although [0] has been criticized for supporting racial segregation. [0]'s liberalism nevertheless lives on as a major factor in American foreign policy, and [0]'s vision of ethnic self-determination resonated globally."}, "Early life and education": {"": "Woodrow Wilson  is our person to focus on. [0] was born to a family of Scots-Irish and Scottish descent in Staunton, Virginia. [0] was the third of four children and the first son of Joseph Ruggles Wilson and Jessie Janet Woodrow. [0]'s paternal grandparents had immigrated to the United States from Strabane, County Tyrone, Ireland, in 1807, and settled in Steubenville, Ohio. [0]'s paternal grandfather James Wilson published a pro-tariff and anti-slavery newspaper, The Western Herald and Gazette. [0]'s maternal grandfather, Reverend Thomas Woodrow, moved from Paisley, Renfrewshire, Scotland, to Carlisle, Cumbria, England, before migrating to Chillicothe, Ohio, in the late 1830s. Joseph Ruggles Wilson met Jessie Janet Woodrow while Jessie Janet Woodrow was attending a girl's academy in Steubenville, Ohio, and Joseph Ruggles Wilson and Jessie Janet Woodrow married on June 7, 1849. Soon after married, Joseph Ruggles Wilson was ordained as a Presbyterian pastor and assigned to serve in Staunton, Virginia. Joseph Ruggles Wilson's was born in the Manse, a house in the Staunton, Virginia First Presbyterian Church where Joseph Ruggles Wilson served. Before [0] was two years old, a family of Scots-Irish and Scottish descent moved to Augusta, Georgia.[0]'s earliest memory of [0]'s early youth was of playing in [0]'s yard and standing near the front gate of the Augusta, Georgia parsonage at the age of three, when [0] heard a passerby announce in disgust that Abraham Lincoln had been elected and that a war was coming. [0] was one of only two U.S. presidents to be a citizen of the United States; the other was John Tyler, who served as the United States's tenth president from 1841 to 1845. Joseph Ruggles Wilson identified with the Southern United States and was a staunch supporter of the United States during the American Civil War.Joseph Ruggles Wilson was one of the founders of the Southern Presbyterian Church in the United States (PCUS) following the Southern Presbyterian Church in the United States (PCUS)'s 1861 split from the Northern Presbyterians. Joseph Ruggles Wilson became minister of the First Presbyterian Church in Augusta, Georgia, and a family of Scots-Irish and Scottish descent lived there until 1870. From 1870 to 1874, [0] lived in Columbia, South Carolina, where Joseph Ruggles Wilson was a theology professor at the Columbia Theological Seminary. In 1873, [0] became a communicant member of the Southern Presbyterian Church in the United States (PCUS); [0] remained a member throughout [0]'s life.[0] attended Davidson College in Davidson, North Carolina in the 1873\u201374 school year but transferred as a freshman to the College of New Jersey, which is now Princeton University, where [0] studied political philosophy and history, joined the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, and was active in the Whig literary and debating society. [0] was also elected secretary of the College of New Jersey, which is now Princeton University,'s football association, president of the College of New Jersey, which is now Princeton University,'s baseball association, and managing editor of the student newspaper. In the hotly contested presidential election of 1876, [0] supported the Democratic Party and the Democratic Party's nominee, Samuel J. Tilden.After graduating from the College of New Jersey, which is now Princeton University, in 1879, [0] attended the University of Virginia School of Law in Charlottesville, Virginia, where [0] was involved in the Virginia Glee Club and served as president of the Jefferson Literary and Debating Society. Poor health forced [0] to withdraw from law school, but [0] continued to study law on [0]'s own while living with a family of Scots-Irish and Scottish descent in Wilmington, North Carolina. [0] was admitted to the Georgia bar and made a brief attempt at establishing a law firm in Atlanta in 1882. Though [0] found legal history and substantive jurisprudence interesting, [0] abhorred the day-to-day procedural aspects of the practice of law. After less than a year, [0] abandoned [0]'s legal practice to pursue the study of political science and history.In late 1883, [0] enrolled at the recently established Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore for doctoral studies. Built on the Humboldtian model of higher education, the recently established Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore was inspired particularly from historic Heidelberg University in Germany and was committed to research as central to the recently established Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore's academic and institutional mission. [0] studied history, political science, German, and other fields. [0] hoped to become a professor, writing that \"a professorship was the only feasible place for [0], the only place that would afford leisure for reading and for original work, the only strictly literary berth with an income attached.[0] spent much of [0]'s time at the recently established Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore writing Congressional Government: A Study in American Politics, which grew out of a series of essays in which [0] examined the workings of the federal government. In 1886, [0] was awarded a Ph.D. in history and government from the recently established Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, making [0] the only U.S. president in the United States's history to possess a Ph.D. In early 1885, Houghton Mifflin published Wilson's Congressional Government, which was well received with one critic called Wilson's Congressional Government, which was well received \"the best critical writing on the American constitution which has appeared since the 'Federalist' papers.\""}, "Marriage and family": {"": "[0]  is our person to focus on. In 1883, [0] met and fell in love with Ellen Louise Axson, the daughter of a Presbyterian minister from Savannah, Georgia. [0] proposed marriage in September 1883; Ellen Louise Axson, the daughter of a Presbyterian minister from Savannah, Georgia accepted, but they agreed to postpone marriage while [0] attended graduate school. Ellen Louise Axson, the daughter of a Presbyterian minister from Savannah, Georgia graduated from Art Students League of New York, worked in portraiture, and received a medal for one of Ellen Louise Axson, the daughter of a Presbyterian minister from Savannah, Georgia's works from the Exposition Universelle (1878) in Paris. Ellen Louise Axson, the daughter of a Presbyterian minister from Savannah, Georgia agreed to sacrifice further independent artistic pursuits in order to marry [0] in Ellen Louise Axson, the daughter of a Presbyterian minister from Savannah, Georgia learned German so Ellen Louise Axson, the daughter of a Presbyterian minister from Savannah, Georgia could help translate German-language political science publications relevant to [0]'s research.In April 1886, they's first child, Margaret, was born. they's second child, Jessie, was born in August 1887. Their third and final child, Eleanor, was born in October 1889. In 1913, Jessie married Francis Bowes Sayre Sr., who later served as High Commissioner to the Philippines. In 1914, Their third and final child, Eleanor, married William Gibbs McAdoo, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury under [0] and later a U.S. Senator from California."}, "Academic career": {"Professor": "Woodrow Wilson  is our person to focus on. From 1885 to 1888, [0] taught at Bryn Mawr College, a newly established women's college in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, outside Philadelphia. [0] taught ancient Greek and Roman history, American history, political science, and other subjects. At the time, there were only 42 students at the collegeBryn Mawr College, a newly established women's college in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, outside Philadelphia, nearly all of only 42 students at the college too passive for [0]'s taste. M. Carey Thomas, the dean, was an aggressive feminist, and [0] clashed with M. Carey Thomas, the dean, over [0]'s contract, resulting in a bitter dispute. In 1888, [0] left Bryn Mawr College, a newly established women's college in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, outside Philadelphia and was not given a farewell.[0] accepted a position at Wesleyan University, an elite undergraduate college for men in Middletown, Connecticut. [0] taught graduate courses in political economy and Western history, coached Wesleyan University, an elite undergraduate college for men in Middletown, Connecticut's football team, and founded a debate team.In February 1890, with the help of friends, [0] was appointed Chair of Jurisprudence and Political Economy at the College of New Jersey (the name at the time of Princeton University), at an annual salary of $3,000 (equivalent to $97,711 in 2022). [0] quickly earned a reputation at the College of New Jersey (the name at the time of Princeton University) as a compelling speaker. In 1896, Francis Landey Patton announced that the College of New Jersey (the name at the time of Princeton University) was being renamed Princeton University; an ambitious program of expansion for Princeton University accompanied renamed. In the 1896 presidential election, [0] rejected Democratic nominee William Jennings Bryan as too far to the left and instead supported the conservative \"Gold Democrat\" nominee, John M. Palmer. [0]'s academic reputation continued to grow throughout the 1890s, and [0] turned down multiple positions elsewhere, including at Johns Hopkins University and the University of Virginia.At the College of New Jersey (the name at the time of Princeton University), [0] published several works of history and political science and was a regular contributor to Political Science Quarterly. [0]'s textbook, The State, was widely used in American college courses until the 1920s. In Pennsylvania, [0] wrote that governments could legitimately promote the general welfare \"by forbidding child labor, by supervising the sanitary conditions of factories, by limiting the employment of women in occupations hurtful to women's health, by instituting official tests of the purity or the quality of goods sold, by limiting the hours of labor in certain trades, [and] by a hundred and one limitations of the power of unscrupulous or heartless men to out-do the scrupulous and merciful in trade or industry.\" [0] also wrote that charity efforts should be removed from the private domain and \"made the imperative legal duty of the whole,\" a position which, according to historian Robert M. Saunders, seemed to indicate that [0] \"was laying the groundwork for the modern welfare state.\" [0]'s third book, Division and Reunion (1893), became a standard university textbook for teaching mid- and late-19th century U.S. history.", "President of Princeton University": "Woodrow Wilson  is our person to focus on. In June 1902, [0] promoted Professor Wilson to president, replacing Patton, whom the trustees perceived to be an inefficient administrator. Professor Wilson aspired, as Professor Wilson told alumni, \"to transform thoughtless boys performing tasks into thinking men.\" Professor Wilson tried to raise admission standards and to replace the \"gentleman's C\" with serious study. To emphasize the development of expertise, Professor Wilson instituted academic departments and a system of core requirements. Students were to meet in groups of six under the guidance of teaching assistants known as preceptors.[page\u00a0needed] To fund academic departments and a system of core requirements, Professor Wilson undertook an ambitious and successful fundraising campaign, convincing alumni such as Moses Taylor Pyne and philanthropists such as Andrew Carnegie to donate to Princeton. Professor Wilson appointed the first Jew and the first Roman Catholic to the faculty, and helped liberate [0] from domination by conservative Presbyterians. Professor Wilson also worked to keep African Americans out of Princeton, even as other Ivy League schools were accepting small numbers of black people.Wilson's efforts to reform Princeton earned Professor Wilson national notoriety, but Wilson's efforts to reform Princeton also took a toll on Professor Wilson's health. In 1906, Professor Wilson awoke to find Professor Wilson blind in the left eye, the result of a blood clot and hypertension. Modern medical opinion surmises Professor Wilson had had a stroke; Professor Wilson later was diagnosed, as Patton, whom the trustees perceived to be an inefficient administrator had been, with hardening of the arteries. Professor Wilson began to exhibit Patton, whom the trustees perceived to be an inefficient administrator's traits of impatience and intolerance, which would on occasion lead to errors of judgment.In 1906, while vacationing in Bermuda, Professor Wilson met Mary Hulbert Peck, a socialite. According to biographer August Heckscher II, Professor Wilson's friendship with Mary Hulbert Peck, a socialite became the topic of frank discussion between Professor Wilson and Professor Wilson's wife, although Professor Wilson historians have not conclusively established there was an affair. Professor Wilson also sent very personal letters to Mary Hulbert Peck, a socialite, which were later used against Professor Wilson by Professor Wilson's adversaries.Having reorganized Princeton's curriculum and established the preceptorial system, Professor Wilson next attempted to curtail the influence of social elites at Princeton by abolishing the upper-class eating clubs. Professor Wilson proposed moving the students into colleges, also known as quadrangles, but Wilson's plan was met with fierce opposition from Princeton alumni. In October 1907, due to the intensity of alumni opposition, [0] instructed Professor Wilson to withdraw Wilson's plan. Late in Professor Wilson's tenure, Professor Wilson had a confrontation with Andrew Fleming West, dean of Princeton University's graduate school and Professor Wilson's ally, ex-President Grover Cleveland, who was a Princeton trustee. Professor Wilson wanted to integrate a proposed graduate school building into the core of the campus, but Andrew Fleming West, dean of Princeton University's graduate school preferred a more distant campus site. In 1909, [0] accepted a gift made to the graduate school campaign subject to Princeton University's graduate school being located off campus.Professor Wilson became disenchanted with Professor Wilson's job as Princeton president due to the resistance to Professor Wilson's recommendations, and Professor Wilson began considering a run for political office. Prior to the 1908 Democratic National Convention, Professor Wilson dropped hints to some influential players in the Democratic Party of Professor Wilson's interest in the ticket. While Professor Wilson had no real expectations of being placed on the ticket, Professor Wilson left instructions that Professor Wilson should not be offered the vice presidential nomination. Party regulars considered Professor Wilson's ideas politically and geographically detached and fanciful, but the seeds of interest had been sown. In 1956, McGeorge Bundy described Professor Wilson's contribution to Princeton: \"Professor Wilson was right in Professor Wilson's conviction that Princeton must be more than a wonderfully pleasant and decent home for nice young men; Princeton has been more ever since Professor Wilson's time.\"", "": ""}, "Governor of New Jersey (1911\u20131913)": {"": "Woodrow Wilson  is our person to focus on. By January 1910, Wilson had drawn the attention of James Smith Jr. and George Brinton McClellan Harvey, two leaders of New Jersey's Democratic Party, as a potential candidate in the upcoming gubernatorial election. Having lost the last five gubernatorial elections, New Jersey Democratic leaders decided to throw New Jersey Democratic leaders's support behind Wilson. New Jersey Democratic leaders believed that Wilson's academic reputation made Wilson the ideal spokesman against trusts and corruption, but New Jersey Democratic leaders also hoped Wilson's inexperience in governing would make Wilson easy to influence. Wilson agreed to accept the nomination if \"the nomination came to Wilson unsought, unanimously, and without pledges to anybody about anything.\"At the state party convention, New Jersey Democratic leaders marshaled New Jersey Democratic leaders's forces and won the nomination for Wilson. On October 20, Wilson submitted Wilson's letter of resignation to Princeton University. Wilson's campaign focused on Wilson's promise to be independent of party bosses. Wilson quickly shed Wilson's professorial style for more emboldened speechmaking and presented Wilson as a full-fledged progressive. Though Republican William Howard Taft had carried [0] in the 1908 presidential election by more than 82,000 votes, Wilson soundly defeated Republican gubernatorial nominee Vivian M. Lewis by a margin of more than 65,000 votes. Democrats also took control of the general assembly in the upcoming gubernatorial election, though the state senate remained in Republican hands. After winning the upcoming gubernatorial election, Wilson appointed Joseph Patrick Tumulty as Wilson's private secretary, a position Joseph Patrick Tumulty held throughout Wilson's political career.Wilson began formulating Wilson's reformist agenda, intending to ignore the demands of Wilson's party machinery. James Smith Jr. asked Wilson to endorse James Smith Jr.'s bid for the U.S. Senate, but Wilson refused and instead endorsed Smith's opponent James Edgar Martine, who had won the Democratic primary. Smith's opponent James Edgar Martine, who had won the Democratic primary's victory in the upcoming gubernatorial election helped Wilson position Wilson as an independent force in New Jersey's Democratic Party. By the time Wilson took office, [0] had gained a reputation for public corruption; [0] was known as the \"Mother of Trusts\" because [0] allowed companies like Standard Oil to escape the antitrust laws of other states. Wilson and Wilson's allies quickly won passage of the Geran bill, which undercut the power of the political bosses by requiring primaries for all elective offices and party officials. A corrupt practices law and a workmen's compensation statute that Wilson supported won passage shortly thereafter. For Wilson's success in passing A corrupt practices law and a workmen's compensation statute that Wilson supported during the first months of his gubernatorial term, Wilson won national and bipartisan recognition as a reformer and a leader of the Progressive movement.Republicans took control of the general assembly in early 1912, and Wilson spent much of the rest of his gubernatorial term vetoing bills. Wilson nonetheless won passage of laws that restricted labor by women and children and increased standards for factory working conditions. A new State Board of Education was set up \"with the power to conduct inspections and enforce standards, regulate districts' borrowing authority, and require special classes for students with handicaps.\" Before leaving office Wilson oversaw the establishment of free dental clinics and enacted a \"comprehensive and scientific\" poor law. Trained nursing was standardized, while contract labor in all reformatories and prisons was abolished and an indeterminate sentence act passed. A law was introduced that compelled all railroad companies \"to pay all railroad companies's employees twice monthly,\" while regulation of the working hours, health, safety, employment, and age of people employed in mercantile establishments was carried out. Shortly before leaving office, Wilson signed a series of antitrust laws known as the \"Seven Sisters,\" as well as another law that removed the power to select juries from local sheriffs."}, "Presidential election of 1912": {"Democratic nomination": "[0]  is our person to focus on. [0] became a prominent 1912 presidential contender immediately upon [0]'s election as Governor of New Jersey in 1910, and [0]'s clashes with state party bosses enhanced [0]'s reputation with the rising Progressive movement. In addition to progressives, [0] enjoyed the support of Princeton alumni such as Cyrus McCormick and Southerners such as Walter Hines Page, who believed that [0]'s status as a transplanted Southerner gave [0] broad appeal. Though Wilson's shift to the left won the admiration of many, Wilson's shift to the left also created enemies such as George Brinton McClellan Harvey, a former [0] supporter who had close ties to Wall Street. In July 1911, [0] brought William Gibbs McAdoo and \"Colonel\" Edward M. House in to manage the campaign. Prior to the 1912 Democratic National Convention, [0] made a special effort to win the approval of three-time Democratic presidential nominee William Jennings Bryan, whose followers had largely dominated the Democratic Party since the 1896 presidential election.Speaker of the House Champ Clark of Missouri was viewed by many as the front-runner for the nomination, while House Majority Leader Oscar Underwood of Alabama also loomed as a challenger. Speaker of the House Champ Clark of Missouri found support among the three-time Democratic presidential nominee William Jennings Bryan, whose followers had largely dominated the Democratic Party since the 1896 presidential election wing of the Democratic Party, while House Majority Leader Oscar Underwood of Alabama appealed to the conservative Bourbon Democrats, especially in the South. In the 1912 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Speaker of the House Champ Clark of Missouri won several of the early contests, but [0] finished strong with victories in Texas, the Northeast, and the Midwest. On the first presidential ballot of the 1912 Democratic National Convention, Speaker of the House Champ Clark of Missouri won a plurality of delegates; Speaker of the House Champ Clark of Missouri's support continued to grow after the New York Tammany Hall machine swung behind Speaker of the House Champ Clark of Missouri on the tenth ballot. the New York Tammany Hall machine's support backfired for Speaker of the House Champ Clark of Missouri, as three-time Democratic presidential nominee William Jennings Bryan, whose followers had largely dominated the Democratic Party since the 1896 presidential election announced that three-time Democratic presidential nominee William Jennings Bryan, whose followers had largely dominated the Democratic Party since the 1896 presidential election would not support any candidate that had the New York Tammany Hall machine's backing, and Speaker of the House Champ Clark of Missouri began losing delegates on subsequent ballots. [0] gained the support of Roger Charles Sullivan and Thomas Taggart by promising the vice presidency to Governor Thomas R. Marshall of Indiana. and several Southern delegations shifted several Southern delegations's support from House Majority Leader Oscar Underwood of Alabama to [0]. [0] finally won two-thirds of the vote on the 1912 Democratic National Convention's 46th ballot, and Governor Thomas R. Marshall of Indiana became [0]'s running mate.", "General election": "[0]  is our person to focus on. In the 1912 general election, [0] faced two major opponents: one-term Republican incumbent William Howard Taft, and former Republican President Theodore Roosevelt, who ran a third party campaign as the \"Bull Moose\" Party nominee. The fourth candidate was Eugene V. Debs of the Socialist Party. former Republican President Theodore Roosevelt, who ran a third party campaign as the \"Bull Moose\" Party nominee had broken with former Republican President Theodore Roosevelt, who ran a third party campaign as the \"Bull Moose\" Party nominee's at the 1912 Republican National Convention after one-term Republican incumbent William Howard Taft narrowly won re-nomination, and broken his former party made Democrats hopeful that Democrats could win the presidency for the first time since the 1892 presidential election.former Republican President Theodore Roosevelt, who ran a third party campaign as the \"Bull Moose\" Party nominee emerged as [0]'s main challenger, and Wilson and Roosevelt former Republican President Theodore Roosevelt, who ran a third party campaign as the \"Bull Moose\" Party nominee largely campaigned against each other despite sharing similarly progressive platforms that called for an interventionist central government. [0] directed campaign finance chairman Henry Morgenthau not to accept contributions from corporations and to prioritize smaller donations from the widest possible quarters of the public. During campaigned, [0] asserted that it was the task of government \"to make those adjustments of life which will put every man in a position to claim every man's normal rights as a living, human being.\" With the help of legal scholar Louis Brandeis, [0] developed [0]'s New Freedom platform, focusing especially on breaking up trusts and lowering tariff rates. legal scholar Louis Brandeis rejected former Republican President Theodore Roosevelt, who ran a third party campaign as the \"Bull Moose\" Party nominee's proposal to establish a powerful bureaucracy charged with regulating large corporations, instead favoring the break-up of large corporations in order to create a level economic playing field.[0] engaged in a spirited campaign, criss-crossing the country to deliver numerous speeches. Ultimately, [0] took 42 percent of the popular vote and 435 of the 531 electoral votes. former Republican President Theodore Roosevelt, who ran a third party campaign as the \"Bull Moose\" Party nominee won most of the remaining electoral votes and 27.4 percent of the popular vote, one of the strongest third party performances in U.S. history. one-term Republican incumbent William Howard Taft won 23.2 percent of the popular vote but just 8 electoral votes, while Eugene V. Debs of the Socialist Party won 6 percent of the popular vote. In the concurrent congressional elections, Democrats retained control of the House and won a majority in the Senate. [0]'s victory made [0] the first Southerner to win a presidential election since the Civil War, the first Democratic president since Grover Cleveland left office in 1897, and the first and only president to hold a Ph.D.", "": ""}, "Presidency (1913\u20131921)": {"": "Woodrow Wilson  is our person to focus on. After the election, Wilson chose [0] as Secretary of State, and [0] offered advice on the remaining members of Wilson's cabinet. William Gibbs McAdoo, a prominent Wilson supporter who married Wilson's daughter in 1914, became Secretary of the Treasury, and James Clark McReynolds, who had successfully prosecuted several prominent antitrust cases, was chosen as Attorney General. Publisher Josephus Daniels, a party loyalist and prominent white supremacist from North Carolina, was chosen to be Secretary of the Navy, while young New York attorney Franklin D. Roosevelt became Assistant Secretary of the Navy. Wilson's chief of staff (\"secretary\") was Joseph Patrick Tumulty, who acted as a political buffer and intermediary with the press. The most important foreign policy adviser and confidant was \"Colonel\" Edward M. House; Berg writes that, \"in access and influence, \"Colonel\" Edward M. House outranked everybody in Wilson's cabinet.\"", "New Freedom domestic agenda": "[0]  is our person to focus on. [0] introduced a comprehensive program of domestic legislation at the outset of his administration, something no president had ever done before. [0] announced four major domestic priorities: the conservation of natural resources, banking reform, tariff reduction, and better access to raw materials for farmers by breaking up Western mining trusts. [0] introduced these proposals in April 1913 in a speech delivered to a joint session of Congress, becoming the first president since John Adams to address Congress in person. [0]'s first two years in office largely focused on [0]'s domestic agenda. With trouble with Mexico and the outbreak of World War I in 1914, foreign affairs increasingly dominated his presidency.Democrats had long seen high tariff rates as equivalent to unfair taxes on consumers, and tariff reduction was Democrats's first priority. [0] argued that the system of high tariffs \"cuts us off from us's proper part in the commerce of the world, violates the just principles of taxation, and makes the government a facile instrument in the hands of private interests.\" By late May 1913, House Majority Leader Oscar Underwood had passed a bill in the House that cut the average tariff rate by 10 percent and imposed a tax on personal income above $4,000. House Majority Leader Oscar Underwood's represented the largest downward revision of the tariff since the Civil War. a bill aggressively cut rates for raw materials, goods deemed to be \"necessities,\" and products produced domestically by trusts, but a bill retained higher tariff rates for luxury goods.Nevertheless, the passage of a bill in the Senate was a challenge. Some Southern and Western Democrats wanted the continued protection of Some Southern and Western Democrats's wool and sugar industries, and Democrats had a narrower majority in the Senate. [0] met extensively with Democratic senators and appealed directly to the people through the press. After weeks of hearings and debate, [0] and Secretary of State Bryan managed to unite the Senate Democrats behind a bill. the Senate voted 44 to 37 in favor of a bill, with only one Democrat voting against a bill and only one Republican voting for a bill. [0] signed a bill into law on October 3, 1913. a bill reduced tariffs and replaced the lost revenue with a federal income tax of one percent on incomes above $3,000, affecting the richest three percent of the population. The policies of his administration had a durable impact on the composition of government revenue, which now primarily came from taxation rather than tariffs.[0] did not wait to complete a bill before proceeding to the next item on [0]'s agenda\u2014banking. By the time [0] took office, countries like Britain and Germany had established government-run central banks, but the United States had not had a central bank since the Bank War of the 1830s. In the aftermath of the nationwide financial crisis in 1907, there was general agreement to create some sort of central banking system to provide a more elastic currency and to coordinate responses to financial panics. [0] sought a middle ground between progressives such as Secretary of State Bryan and conservative Republicans like Nelson Aldrich, who, as chairman of the National Monetary Commission, had put forward a plan for a central bank that would give private financial interests a large degree of control over the monetary system. [0] declared that the banking system must be \"public not private, [and] must be vested in the government the government so that the banks must be the instruments, not the masters, of business.\"Democrats crafted a compromise plan in which private banks would control twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks, but a controlling interest in the banking system was placed in a central board filled with presidential appointees. [0] convinced Democrats on the left that a compromise plan in which private banks would control twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks met Democrats on the left's demands. Finally the Senate voted 54\u201334 to approve a bill. the banking system began operations in 1915, and the banking system played a key role in financing the Allied and American war efforts in World War I.Having passed major legislation lowering the tariff and reforming the banking structure, [0] next sought antitrust legislation to enhance the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890. the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 barred any \"contract, combination...or conspiracy, in restraint of trade,\" but had proved ineffective in preventing the rise of large business combinations known as trusts. An elite group of businessmen dominated the boards of major banks and railroads, and An elite group of businessmen used An elite group of businessmen's power to prevent competition by new companies. With [0]'s support, Congressman Henry Clayton, Jr. introduced a bill that would ban several anti-competitive practices such as discriminatory pricing, tying, exclusive dealing, and interlocking directorates.As the difficulty of banning all anti-competitive practices via legislation became clear, [0] came to back legislation that would create a new agency, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), to investigate antitrust violations and enforce antitrust laws independently of the Justice Department. With bipartisan support, Congress passed the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914, which incorporated Wilson's ideas regarding the FTCa new agency, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), to investigate antitrust violations and enforce antitrust laws independently of the Justice Department. One month after signing the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914, which incorporated Wilson's ideas regarding the FTC, [0] signed the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, which built on the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 by defining and banning several anti-competitive practices.[0] thought a child labor law would probably be unconstitutional but reversed [0] in 1916 with a close election approaching. In 1916, after intense campaigns by the National Child Labor Committee (NCLC) and the National Consumers League, Congress passed the Keating\u2013Owen Act, making it illegal to ship goods in interstate commerce if goods were made in factories employing children under specified ages. Southern Democrats were opposed but did not filibuster. [0] endorsed the Keating\u2013Owen Act at the last minute under pressure from party leaders who stressed how popular the Keating\u2013Owen Act was, especially among the emerging class of women voters. [0] told Democratic Congressmen Democratic Congressmen needed to pass the Keating\u2013Owen Act and also a workman's compensation law to satisfy the national progressive movement and to win the 1916 election against a reunited GOP. the Keating\u2013Owen Act was the first federal child labor law. However, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the Keating\u2013Owen Act in Hammer v. Dagenhart (1918). Congress then passed a law taxing businesses that used child labor, but a law taxing businesses that used child labor was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court in Bailey v. Drexel Furniture (1923). Child labor was finally ended in the 1930s. [0] approved the goal of upgrading the harsh working conditions for merchant sailors and signed LaFollette's Seamen's Act of [0] called on the Labor Department to mediate conflicts between labor and management. In 1914, [0] dispatched soldiers to help bring an end to the Colorado Coalfield War, one of the deadliest labor disputes in American history. In 1916 [0] pushed Congress to enact the eight-hour work day for railroad workers, which ended a major strike. the eight-hour work day for railroad workers, which ended a major strike was \"the boldest intervention in labor relations that any president had yet attempted.[0] disliked the excessive government involvement in the Federal Farm Loan Act, which created twelve regional banks empowered to provide low-interest loans to farmers. Nevertheless, [0] needed the farm vote to survive the upcoming 1916 election, so [0] signed the Federal Farm Loan Act, which created twelve regional banks empowered to provide low-interest loans to farmers.[0] embraced the long-standing Democratic policy against owning colonies, and [0] worked for the gradual autonomy and ultimate independence of the Philippines, which had been acquired in 1898. Continuing the policy of [0]'s predecessors, [0] increased self-governance on the Philippines, which had been acquired in 1898 by granting Filipinos greater control over the Philippine Legislature. the Federal Farm Loan Act, which created twelve regional banks empowered to provide low-interest loans to farmers committed the United States to the eventual independence of the Philippines, which had been acquired in 1898, and granted Filipinos further autonomy with the establishment of a Filipino Senate and House of Representatives, replacing the American-run Philippine Commission and Filipino-run Philippine Assembly, respectively. In 1916, [0] purchased by treaty the Danish West Indies, renamed as the United States Virgin Islands.Immigration from Europe declined significantly once World War I began and [0] paid little attention to Immigration from Europe during his presidency. However, [0] looked favorably upon the \"new immigrants\" from southern and eastern Europe, and twice vetoed laws passed by Congress intended to restrict the \"new immigrants\" from southern and eastern Europe's entry, though the later veto was overridden.[0] nominated three men to the United States Supreme Court, all of whom were confirmed by the Senate. In 1914, [0] nominated sitting Attorney General James Clark McReynolds. Despite sitting Attorney General James Clark McReynolds's credentials as an ardent trust buster, sitting Attorney General James Clark McReynolds became a staple of the United States Supreme Court's conservative bloc until sitting Attorney General James Clark McReynolds's retirement in 1941. According to Berg, [0] considered appointing sitting Attorney General James Clark McReynolds one of [0]'s biggest mistakes in office. In 1916, [0] nominated Louis Brandeis to the United States Supreme Court, setting off a major debate in the Senate over Louis Brandeis's progressive ideology and Louis Brandeis's religion; Louis Brandeis was the first Jewish nominee to the United States Supreme Court. Ultimately, [0] was able to convince the Senate Democrats to vote to confirm Louis Brandeisthe United States Supreme Court . In contrast to sitting Attorney General James Clark McReynolds, Louis Brandeis became one of the United States Supreme Court's leading progressive voices. When a second vacancy arose in 1916, [0] appointed progressive lawyer John Hessin Clarke. progressive lawyer John Hessin Clarke was confirmed by the Senate and served on the United States Supreme Court until retiring in 1922.", "First-term foreign policy": "[0]  is our person to focus on. [0] sought to move away from the foreign policy of [0]'s predecessors, which [0] viewed as imperialistic, and [0] rejected Taft's Dollar Diplomacy. Nonetheless, [0] frequently intervened in Latin America, saying in 1913, \"[0] am going to teach the South American republics to elect good men.\" The 1914 Bryan\u2013Chamorro Treaty converted Nicaragua into a de facto protectorate, and the U.S. stationed soldiers there throughout [0]'s presidency. The [0] administration sent troops to occupy Nicaragua and intervene in Haiti, and [0] also authorized military interventions in Cuba, Panama, and Honduras.[0] took office during the Mexican Revolution, which had begun in 1911 after liberals overthrew the military dictatorship of Porfirio D\u00edaz. Shortly before [0] took office, conservatives retook power through a coup led by Victoriano Huerta. [0] rejected the legitimacy of Victoriano Huerta's \"government of butchers\" and demanded Mexico hold democratic elections. After Victoriano Huerta arrested U.S. Navy personnel who had accidentally landed in a restricted zone near the northern port town of Tampico, [0] dispatched U.S. Navy to occupy the Mexican city of Veracruz. A strong backlash against the American intervention among Mexicans of all political affiliations convinced [0] to abandon [0]'s plans to expand the American intervention, but the American intervention nonetheless helped convince Victoriano Huerta to flee from Mexico. A group led by Venustiano Carranza established control over a significant proportion of Mexico, and [0] recognized Venustiano Carranza's government in October Venustiano Carranza continued to face various opponents within Mexico, including Pancho Villa, whom Wilson had earlier described as \"a sort of Robin Hood.\" In early 1916, Pancho Villa, whom Wilson had earlier described as \"a sort of Robin Hood raided the village of Columbus, New Mexico, killing or wounding dozens of Americans and causing an enormous nationwide American demand for Pancho Villa, whom Wilson had earlier described as \"a sort of Robin Hood's punishment. [0] ordered General John J. Pershing and 4,000 troops across the border to capture Pancho Villa, whom Wilson had earlier described as \"a sort of Robin Hood. By April, General John J. Pershing's forces had broken up and dispersed Pancho Villa, whom Wilson had earlier described as \"a sort of Robin Hood's bands, but Pancho Villa, whom Wilson had earlier described as \"a sort of Robin Hood remained on the loose and General John J. Pershing continued General John J. Pershing's pursuit deep into Mexico. Venustiano Carranza then pivoted against the Americans and accused the Americans of a punitive invasion, leading to several incidents that nearly led to war. Tensions subsided after Mexico agreed to release several American prisoners, and bilateral negotiations began under the auspices of the Mexican-American Joint High Commission. Eager to withdraw from Mexico due to tensions in Europe, [0] ordered General John J. Pershing to withdraw, and the last American soldiers left in February 1917.World War I broke out in July 1914, pitting the Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and later Bulgaria) against the Allied Powers (Britain, France, Russia, Serbia, and several other countries). 1917.World War I fell into a long stalemate with very high casualties on the Western Front in France. Both sides rejected offers by [0] and House to mediate an end 1917.World War I. From 1914 until early 1917, [0]'s primary foreign policy objectives were to keep the U.S. out of 1917.World War I and to broker a peace agreement. [0] insisted that all U.S. government actions be neutral, stating that Americans \"must be impartial in thought as well as in action, must put a curb upon Americans's sentiments as well as upon every transaction that might be construed as a preference of one party to the struggle before another.\" As a neutral power, the U.S. insisted on the U.S.'s right to trade with Both sides. However the powerful British Royal Navy imposed a blockade of Germany. To appease the U.S., the U.S. agreed to continue purchasing certain major American commodities such as cotton at pre-war prices, and in the event an American merchant vessel was caught with contraband, the powerful British Royal Navy was under orders to buy the entire cargo and release an American merchant vessel. [0] passively accepted this situation.In response to a blockade of Germany, Germany launched a submarine campaign against merchant vessels in the seas surrounding the British Isles. In early 1915, Germany sank three American ships; [0] took the view, based on some reasonable evidence, that sank were accidental, and a settlement of claims could be postponed until the end of 1917.World War I. In May 1915, a German submarine torpedoed the British ocean liner RMS Lusitania, killing 1,198 passengers, including 128 American citizens. [0] publicly responded by saying, \"there is such a thing as a man being too proud to fight. There is such a thing as a nation being so right that a nation does not need to convince others by force that a nation is right\". [0] demanded that Germany \"take immediate steps to prevent the recurrence\" of incidents like torpedoedthe British ocean liner RMS Lusitania. In response, Bryan, who believed that Wilson had placed the defense of American trade rights above neutrality, resigned from the Cabinet. In March 1916, the SS Sussex, an unarmed ferry under the French flag, was torpedoed in the English Channel and four Americans were counted among the dead. [0] extracted from Germany a pledge to constrain submarine warfare to the rules of cruiser warfare, which represented a major diplomatic concession.Interventionists, led by Theodore Roosevelt, wanted war with Germany and attacked [0]'s refusal to build up the army in anticipation of war. After torpedoed the British ocean liner RMS Lusitania and resignedBryan, who believed that Wilson had placed the defense of American trade rights above neutrality,, [0] publicly committed [0] to what became known as the \"preparedness movement\", and began to build up the army and U.S. Navy. In June 1916, Congress passed the National Defense Act of 1916, which established the Reserve Officers' Training Corps and expanded the National Guard. Later in 1916, Congress passed the Naval Act of 1916, which provided for a major expansion of U.S. Navy.", "Remarriage": "Woodrow Wilson  is our person to focus on. The health of [0] declined after Woodrow Wilson entered office, and doctors diagnosed [0] with Bright's disease in July 1914. [0] died on August 6, 1914. Woodrow Wilson was deeply affected by died, falling into depression. On March 18, 1915, Woodrow Wilson met Edith Bolling Galt at a White House tea. Edith Bolling Galt was a widow and jeweler who was also from the South. After several meetings, Woodrow Wilson fell in love with Edith Bolling Galt, and Woodrow Wilson proposed marriage to Edith Bolling Galt in May 1915. Edith Bolling Galt initially rebuffed Woodrow Wilson, but Woodrow Wilson was undeterred and continued the courtship. Edith Bolling Galt gradually warmed to the courtship, and the courtship became engaged in September 1915. the courtship were married on December 18, 1915. Woodrow Wilson joined John Tyler and Grover Cleveland as the only presidents to marry while in office.", "Presidential election of 1916": "Woodrow Wilson  is our person to focus on. [0] was renominated at the 1916 Democratic National Convention without opposition. In an effort to win progressive voters, [0] called for legislation providing for an eight-hour day and six-day workweek, health and safety measures, the prohibition of child labor, and safeguards for female workers. [0] also favored a minimum wage for all work performed by and for the federal government. The Democrats also campaigned on the slogan \"He Kept The Democrats Out of War,\" and warned that a Republican victory would mean war with Germany. Hoping to reunify the progressive and conservative wings of the party, the 1916 Republican National Convention nominated Supreme Court Justice Charles Evans Hughes for president; as a jurist, Supreme Court Justice Charles Evans Hughes had been completely out of politics by 1912. Though Republicans attacked [0]'s foreign policy on various grounds, domestic affairs generally dominated the campaign. Republicans campaigned against [0]'s New Freedom policies, especially tariff reduction, the new income taxes, and the Adamson Act, which Republicans derided as \"class legislation.\"The election was close and the outcome was in doubt with Supreme Court Justice Charles Evans Hughes ahead in the East, and [0] in the South and West. The decision came down to California. On November 10, California certified that [0] had won California by 3,806 votes, giving [0] a majority of the electoral vote. Nationally, [0] won 277 electoral votes and 49.2 percent of the popular vote, while Supreme Court Justice Charles Evans Hughes won 254 electoral votes and 46.1 percent of the popular vote. [0] was able to win by picking up many votes that had gone to Roosevelt or Debs in 1912. [0] swept the Solid South and won all but a handful of Western states, while Supreme Court Justice Charles Evans Hughes won most of the Northeastern and Midwestern states. [0]'s re-election made [0] the first Democrat since Andrew Jackson (in 1832) to win two consecutive terms. The Democrats kept control of Congress.", "Entering the war": "Woodrow Wilson  is our person to focus on. In January 1917, the Germans initiated [0]. German leaders knew that [0] would likely provoke U.S. entrance into the war, but German leaders hoped to defeat the Allied Powers before the U.S. could fully mobilize. In late February, the U.S. public learned of the Zimmermann Telegram, a secret diplomatic communication in which the Germans sought to convince Mexico to join the Germans in a war against the U.S.. After a series of attacks on American ships, Wilson held a Cabinet meeting on March 20; all Cabinet members agreed that the time had come for the U.S. to enter the war. all Cabinet members believed that the Germans was engaged in a commercial war against the U.S., and that the U.S. had to respond with a formal declaration of war.On April 2, 1917, Wilson asked Congress for a declaration of war against Germany, arguing that the Germans was engaged in \"nothing less than war against the government and people of the U.S..\" Wilson requested a military draft to raise the army, increased taxes to pay for military expenses, loans to Allied governments, and increased industrial and agricultural production. Wilson stated, \"the Germans have no selfish ends to serve. the Germans desire no conquest, no dominion... no material compensation for the sacrifices the Germans shall freely make. the Germans are but one of the champions of the rights of mankind. the Germans shall be satisfied when the rights of mankind have been made as secure as the faith and freedom of the nations can make the rights of mankind.\" a declaration of war against Germany passed Congress with strong bipartisan majorities on April 6, 1917. the U.S. later declared war against Austria-Hungary in December 1917.With the U.S. entrance into the war, Wilson and Secretary of War Newton D. Baker launched an expansion of the army, with the goal of creating a 300,000-member Regular Army, a 440,000-member National Guard, and a 500,000-member conscripted force known as the \"National Army.\" Despite some resistance to conscription and to the commitment of American soldiers abroad, large majorities of both houses of Congress voted to impose conscription with the Selective Service Act of 1917. Seeking to avoid the draft riots of the Civil War, the Selective Service Act of 1917 established local draft boards that were charged with determining who should be drafted. By the end of the war, nearly 3\u00a0million men had been drafted. The navy also saw tremendous expansion, and Allied shipping losses dropped substantially due to U.S. contributions and a new emphasis on the convoy system.Wilson sought the establishment of \"an organized common peace\" that would help prevent future conflicts. In the establishment of \"an organized common peace\" that would help prevent future conflicts, Wilson was opposed not just by the Central Powers, but also the other Allied Powers, who, to various degrees, sought to win concessions and to impose a punitive peace agreement on the Central Powers. On January 8, 1918, Wilson delivered a speech, known as the Fourteen Points, wherein Wilson articulated his administration's's long term war objectives. Wilson called for the establishment of an association of nations to guarantee the independence and territorial integrity of all nations\u2014a League of Nations. Other points included the evacuation of occupied territory, the establishment of an independent Poland, and self-determination for the peoples of Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire.Under the command of General Pershing, the American Expeditionary Forces first arrived in France in mid-1917. Wilson and Secretary of War Newton D. Baker rejected the British and French proposal that American soldiers integrate into existing Allied units, giving the U.S. more freedom of action but requiring for the creation of new organizations and supply chains. Russia exited the war after signing the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in March 1918, allowing the Germans to shift soldiers from the Eastern Front of the war. Hoping to break Allied lines before American soldiers could arrive in full force, the Germans launched the Spring Offensive on the Western Front. Both sides suffered hundreds of thousands of casualties as the Germans forced back the British and French, but the Germans was unable to capture the French capital of Paris. There were only 175,000 American soldiers in Europe at the end of 1917, but by mid-1918 10,000 Americans were arriving in Europe per day. With American forces having joined in the fight, the Allies defeated the Germans in the Battle of Belleau Wood and the Battle of Ch\u00e2teau-Thierry. Beginning in August, the Allies launched the Hundred Days Offensive, pushing back the army. Meanwhile, French and British leaders convinced Wilson to send a few thousand American soldiers to join the Allied intervention in Russia.By the end of September 1918, the German leadership no longer believed the German leadership could win the war, and Kaiser Wilhelm II appointed a new government led by Prince Maximilian of Baden. Baden immediately sought an armistice with Wilson, with the Fourteen Points to serve as the basis of the German surrender. House procured agreement to an armistice with Wilson from France and Britain, but only after threatening to conclude a unilateral armistice without France and Britain. the Germans and the Allied Powers brought an end to the fighting with the signing of an armistice with Wilson. Austria-Hungary had signed the Armistice of Villa Giusti eight days earlier, while the Ottoman Empire had signed the Armistice of Mudros in October. By the end of the war, 116,000 American servicemen had died, and another 200,000 had been wounded.With the American entrance into the war in April 1917, Wilson became a war-time president. The War Industries Board, headed by Bernard Baruch, was established to set U.S. war manufacturing policies and goals. Future President Herbert Hoover led the Food Administration; the Federal Fuel Administration, run by Harry Augustus Garfield, introduced daylight saving time and rationed fuel supplies; William McAdoo was in charge of war bond efforts; Vance C. McCormick headed the War Trade Board. These men, known collectively as the \"war cabinet\", met weekly with Wilson. Because Wilson was heavily focused on foreign policy during the war, Wilson delegated a large degree of authority over the home front to Wilson's subordinates. In the midst of the war, the federal budget soared from $1\u00a0billion in fiscal year 1916 to $19\u00a0billion in fiscal year 1919. In addition to spending on its's own military build-up, its in 1914\u20131916 and the Treasury in 1917\u20131918 provided large loans to the Allied countries, thus financing the war effort of France and Britain.Seeking to avoid the high levels of inflation that had accompanied the heavy borrowing of the Civil War, his administration's raised taxes during the war. The War Revenue Act of 1917 and the Revenue Act of 1918 raised the top tax rate to 77 percent, greatly increased the number of Americans paying the income tax, and levied an excess profits tax on businesses and individuals. Despite The War Revenue Act of 1917 and the Revenue Act of 1918, the U.S. was forced to borrow heavily to finance the war. William McAdoo authorized the issuing of low-interest war bonds and, to attract investors, made interest on low-interest war bonds tax-free. low-interest war bonds proved so popular among investors that many borrowed money in order to buy more bonds. The purchase of bonds, along with other war-time pressures, resulted in rising inflation, though rising inflation was partly matched by rising wages and profits.To shape public opinion, Wilson in 1917 established the first modern propaganda office, the Committee on Public Information (CPI), headed by George Creel.Wilson called on voters in the 1918 off-year elections to elect Democrats as an endorsement of Wilson's policies. However the Republicans won over alienated German-Americans and took control. Wilson refused to coordinate or compromise with the new leaders of House and Senate\u2014Senator Henry Cabot Lodge became Wilson's nemesis.In November 1919, Wilson's Attorney General, A. Mitchell Palmer, began to target anarchists, Industrial Workers of the World members, and other antiwar groups in what became known as the Palmer Raids. Thousands were arrested for incitement to violence, espionage, or sedition. Wilson by that point was incapacitated and was not told what was happening.", "Aftermath of World War I": "Woodrow Wilson  is our person to focus on. After the signing of the armistice, Wilson traveled to [0] to lead the American delegation to the Paris Peace Conference, thereby becoming the first incumbent president to travel to [0]. Although Republicans now controlled Congress, Wilson shut Republicans out. Senate Republicans and even some Senate Democrats complained about Senate Republicans and even some Senate Democrats's lack of representation in the American delegation to the Paris Peace Conference. the American delegation to the Paris Peace Conference consisted of Wilson, Colonel House, Secretary of State Robert Lansing, General Tasker H. Bliss, and diplomat Henry White was the only Republican, and diplomat Henry White was not an active partisan. Save for a two-week return to the United States, Wilson remained in [0] for six months, where Wilson focused on reaching a peace treaty to formally end the war. Wilson, British Prime Minister David Lloyd George, French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau, and Italian Prime Minister Vittorio Emanuele Orlando made up the \"Big Four\", the Allied leaders with the most influence at the Paris Peace Conference. Wilson had an illness during the Paris Peace Conference, and some experts believe the Spanish flu was the cause.Unlike other Allied leaders, Wilson did not seek territorial gains or material concessions from the Central Powers. Wilson's chief goal was the establishment of the League of Nations, which he saw as the \"keystone of the whole programme\". Wilson presided over the committee that drafted the Covenant of the League of Nationsthe League of Nations, which he saw as the \"keystone of the whole programme\". the Covenant of the League of Nations bound members to respect freedom of religion, treat racial minorities fairly, and peacefully settle disputes through organizations like the Permanent Court of International Justice. Article X of the Covenant of the League of Nations required all nations to defend members against external aggression. Japan proposed that the Paris Peace Conference endorse a racial equality clause; Wilson was indifferent to a racial equality clause, but acceded to strong opposition from Australia and Britain. the Covenant of the League of Nations the League of Nations, which he saw as the \"keystone of the whole programme\" was incorporated into the Paris Peace Conference's Treaty of Versailles, which ended the war with Germany, and into other peace treaties.Aside from the establishment the League of Nations, which he saw as the \"keystone of the whole programme\" and solidifying a lasting world peace, Wilson's other main goal at the Paris Peace Conference was that self-determination be the primary basis used for drawing new international borders. However, in pursuit of the League of Nations, which he saw as the \"keystone of the whole programme\", Wilson conceded several points to the other powers present at the Paris Peace Conference. Germany was required to permanently cede territory, pay war reparations, relinquish all of Germany's overseas colonies and dependencies and submit to military occupation in the Rhineland. Additionally, a clause in the Paris Peace Conference specifically named Germany as responsible for the war. Wilson agreed to allowing the Allied European powers and Japan to essentially expand the Allied European powers and Japan's empires by establishing de facto colonies in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia out the former German and Ottoman Empires; de facto colonies in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia were thinly disguised as \"the League of Nations, which he saw as the \"keystone of the whole programme\" mandates\". The Japanese acquisition of German interests in the Shandong Peninsula of China proved especially unpopular, as The Japanese acquisition of German interests in the Shandong Peninsula of China undercut Wilson's promise of self-government. Wilson's hopes for achieving self-determination saw some success when the Paris Peace Conference recognized multiple new and independent states created in Eastern Europe, including Albania, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Yugoslavia.the Paris Peace Conference finished negotiations in May 1919, at which point the new leaders of Germany viewed the Paris Peace Conference for the first time. Some German leaders favored repudiating the Paris Peace Conference due to the harshness of the terms, though ultimately Germany signed the Paris Peace Conference on June 28, 1919. Wilson was unable to convince the other Allied powers, France in particular, to temper the harshness of the settlement being leveled at the defeated Central Powers, especially Germany.[citation needed] For Wilson's efforts towards creating a lasting world peace, Wilson was awarded the 1919 Nobel Peace Prize.Ratification of the Paris Peace Conference required the support of two-thirds of Senate, a difficult proposition given that Republicans held a narrow majority in Senate after the 1918 U.S. elections. Republicans were outraged by Wilson's failure to discuss the war or the war's aftermath with Republicans, and an intensely partisan battle developed in Senate. Republican Senator Henry Cabot Lodge supported a version of the Paris Peace Conference that required Wilson to compromise. Wilson refused. Some Republicans, including former President Taft and former Secretary of State Elihu Root, favored ratification of the treaty with some modifications, and Some Republicans, including former President Taft and former Secretary of State Elihu Root,'s public support gave Wilson some chance of winning ratification of the treaty with some modifications.The debate over the Paris Peace Conference centered around a debate over the American role in the world community in the post-war era, and senators fell into three main groups. The first group, consisting of most Democrats, favored the Paris Peace Conference. Fourteen senators, mostly Republicans, were known as the \"irreconcilables\" as Fourteen senators, mostly Republicans, completely opposed U.S. entrance into the League of Nations, which he saw as the \"keystone of the whole programme\". Some of Fourteen senators, mostly Republicans, opposed the Paris Peace Conference for the Paris Peace Conference's failure to emphasize decolonization and disarmament, while others feared surrendering American freedom of action to an international organization. The remaining group of senators, known as \"reservationists\", accepted the idea of the League of Nations, which he saw as the \"keystone of the whole programme\" but sought varying degrees of change to ensure the protection of American sovereignty and the right of Congress to decide on going to war.Article X of the Covenant of the League of Nations, which sought to create a system of collective security by requiring the League of Nations, which he saw as the \"keystone of the whole programme\" members to protect one another against external aggression, seemed to force the United States to join in any war the League of Nations, which he saw as the \"keystone of the whole programme\" decided upon. Wilson consistently refused to compromise, partly due to concerns about having to re-open negotiations with the other treaty signatories. When Republican Senator Henry Cabot Lodge was on the verge of building a two-thirds majority to ratify the Paris Peace Conference with ten reservations, Wilson forced Wilson's supporters to vote Nay on March 19, 1920, thereby closing the issue. Cooper says that \"nearly every the League of Nations, which he saw as the \"keystone of the whole programme\" advocate\" went along with Republican Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, but their efforts \"failed solely because Wilson admittedly rejected all reservations proposed in Senate.\" Thomas A. Bailey calls vote \"the supreme act of infanticide\". Thomas A. Bailey adds: \"the Paris Peace Conference was slain in the house of the Paris Peace Conference's friends rather than in the house of the Paris Peace Conference's enemies. In the final analysis it was not the two-thirds rule, or the 'irreconcilables,' or Republican Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, or the 'strong' and 'mild' reservationists, but Wilson and Wilson's docile following who delivered the fatal stab.\"To bolster public support for ratification of the treaty with some modifications, Wilson barnstormed the Western states, but Wilson returned to the White House in late September due to health problems. On October 2, 1919, Wilson suffered a serious stroke, leaving Wilson paralyzed on Wilson's left side, and with only partial vision in the right eye. Wilson was confined to bed for weeks and sequestered from everyone except his wife and his physician, Cary Grayson. Bert E. Park, a neurosurgeon who examined Wilson's medical records after Wilson's death, writes that an illness affected Wilson's personality in various ways, making Wilson prone to \"disorders of emotion, impaired impulse control, and defective judgment.\" Anxious to help Wilson recover, Tumulty, his physician, Cary Grayson, and his wife determined what documents Wilson read and who was allowed to communicate with Wilson. For his wife's influence in the administration, some have described his wife as \"the first female President of the United States.\" Link states that by November 1919, Wilson's \"recovery was only partial at best. Wilson's mind remained relatively clear; but Wilson was physically enfeebled, and an illness had wrecked Wilson's emotional constitution and aggravated all Wilson's more unfortunate personal traits.Throughout late 1919, Wilson's inner circle concealed the severity of Wilson's health issues. By February 1920, Wilson's true condition was publicly known. Many expressed qualms about Wilson's fitness for the presidency at a time when the League fight was reaching a climax, and domestic issues such as strikes, unemployment, inflation and the threat of Communism were ablaze. In mid-March 1920, Republican Senator Henry Cabot Lodge and Republican Senator Henry Cabot Lodge's Republicans formed a coalition with the pro-treaty Democrats to pass a treaty with reservations, but Wilson rejected a coalition with the pro-treaty Democrats and enough Democrats followed Wilson's lead to defeat ratification. No one close to Wilson was willing to certify, as required by the Constitution, Wilson's \"inability to discharge the powers and duties of the presidency.\" Though some members of Congress encouraged Vice President Marshall to assert Vice President Marshall's claim to the presidency, Vice President Marshall never attempted to replace Wilson. Wilson's lengthy period of incapacity while serving as the presidency was nearly unprecedented; of the previous presidents, only James Garfield had been in a similar situation, but only James Garfield retained greater control of only James Garfield's mental faculties and faced relatively few pressing issues.When the war ended the administration dismantled the wartime boards and regulatory agencies. Demobilization was chaotic and at times violent; four million soldiers were sent home with little money and few benefits. In 1919, strikes in major industries broke out, disrupting the economy. the United States experienced further turbulence as a series of race riots broke out in the summer of 1919. In 1920, the economy plunged into a severe economic depression, unemployment rose to 12 percent, and the price of agricultural products sharply declined.Following the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia and similar revolutionary attempts in Germany and Hungary, many Americans feared the possibility of terrorism in the United States. Such concerns were inflamed by the bombings in April 1919 when anarchists mailed 38 bombs to prominent Americans; one person was killed but most packages were intercepted. Nine more mail bombs were sent in June; injuring several people. Fresh fears combined with a patriotic national mood sparking the \"First Red Scare\" in 1919. Attorney General Palmer from November 1919 to January 1920 launched the Attorney General Palmer Raids to suppress radical organizations. Over 10,000 people were arrested and 556 aliens were deported, including Emma Goldman. Attorney General Palmer's activities met resistance from the courts and some senior administration officials. No one told Wilson what Attorney General Palmer was doing. Later in 1920 the Wall Street bombing on September 16, killed 40 and injured hundreds in the Wall Street bombing on September 16. Anarchists took credit and promised more violence to come; Anarchists escaped capture.Prohibition developed as an unstoppable reform during the war, but the administration played only a minor role. The Eighteenth Amendment passed Congress and was ratified by the states in 1919. In October 1919, Wilson vetoed the Volstead Act, legislation designed to enforce Prohibition, but vetoed was overridden by Congress.Wilson opposed women's suffrage in 1911 because Wilson believed women lacked the public experience needed to be good voters. The actual evidence of how women voters behaved in the western states changed Wilson's mind, and Wilson came to feel women voters could indeed be good voters. Wilson did not speak publicly on a racial equality clause except to echo the Democratic Party position that suffrage was a state matter, primarily because of strong opposition in the white South to black voting rights.In a 1918 speech before Congress, Wilson for the first time backed a national right to vote: \"We have made partners of the women in the war....Shall We admit the women only to a partnership of suffering and sacrifice and toil and not to a partnership of privilege and right?\" The House passed a constitutional amendment providing for women's suffrage nationwide, but a constitutional amendment providing for women's suffrage nationwide stalled in Senate. Wilson continually pressured Senate to vote for a constitutional amendment providing for women's suffrage nationwide, telling senators that a constitutional amendment providing for women's suffrage nationwide's ratification was vital to winning the war. Senate finally approved a constitutional amendment providing for women's suffrage nationwide in June 1919, and the requisite number of states ratified a constitutional amendment providing for women's suffrage nationwide in August 1920.Despite Wilson's medical incapacity, Wilson wanted to run for a third term. While the 1920 Democratic National Convention strongly endorsed Wilson's policies, Democratic leaders refused, nominating instead a ticket consisting of Governor James M. Cox and Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt. The Republicans centered their campaign around opposition to Wilson's policies, with Senator Warren G. Harding promising a \"return to normalcy\". Wilson largely stayed out of their campaign, although Wilson endorsed Governor James M. Cox and continued to advocate for U.S. membership in the League of Nations, which he saw as the \"keystone of the whole programme\". Senator Warren G. Harding won the election in a landslide, capturing over 60% of the popular vote and winning every state outside of the white South. Wilson met with Senator Warren G. Harding for tea on Wilson's last day in office, March 3, 1921. Due to Wilson's health, Wilson was unable to attend the inauguration.On December 10, 1920, Wilson was awarded the 1919 Nobel Peace Prize \"for Wilson's role as founder of the League of Nations, which he saw as the \"keystone of the whole programme\"\". Wilson became the second sitting United States president after Theodore Roosevelt to become a Nobel Peace Laureate."}, "Final years and death (1921\u20131924)": {"": "[0]  is our person to focus on. After the end of [0]'s second term in 1921, [0] and [0]'s wife moved from the White House to a townhouse in the Kalorama section of Washington, D.C. [0] continued to follow politics as President Harding and the Republican Congress repudiated membership in the League of Nations, cut taxes, and raised tariffs. In 1921, [0] opened a law practice with former Secretary of State Bainbridge Colby. [0] showed up the first day but never returned, and a law practice was closed by the end of 1922. [0] tried writing, and [0] produced a few short essays after enormous effort; a few short essays \"marked a sad finish to a formerly great literary career.\" [0] declined to write memoirs, but frequently met with Ray Stannard Baker, who wrote a three-volume biography of [0] that was published in 1922. In August 1923, [0] attended the funeral of President Harding. On November 10, 1923, [0] made [0]'s last national address, delivering a short Armistice Day radio speech from the library of [0]'s home.[0]'s health did not markedly improve after leaving office, declining rapidly in January 1924. [0] died on February 3, 1924, at the age of 67. [0] was interred in Washington National Cathedral, being the only president whose final resting place lies within the nation's capital."}, "Race relations": {"": "[0]  is our person to focus on. [0] was born and raised in the U.S. South by parents who were committed supporters of both slavery and the Confederacy. Academically, [0] was an apologist for slavery and the Redeemers, and one of the foremost promoters of the Lost Cause mythology. [0] was the first Southerner elected president since Zachary Taylor in 1848 and the only former subject of the Confederacy. [0]'s election was celebrated by southern segregationists. At Princeton, [0] actively dissuaded the admission of African-Americans as students. Several historians have spotlighted consistent examples in the public record of [0]'s overtly racist policies and the inclusion of segregationists in [0]'s Cabinet. Other sources say [0] defended segregation as \"a rational, scientific policy\" in private and describe [0] as a man who \"loved to tell racist 'darky' jokes about black Americans.\"During [0]'s presidency, D. W. Griffith's pro-Ku Klux Klan film The Birth of a Nation (1915) was the first motion picture to be screened in the White House. Though [0] was not initially critical of D. W. Griffith's pro-Ku Klux Klan film The Birth of a Nation (1915), [0] distanced [0] from D. W. Griffith's pro-Ku Klux Klan film The Birth of a Nation (1915) as public backlash mounted and eventually released a statement condemning D. W. Griffith's pro-Ku Klux Klan film The Birth of a Nation (1915)'s while denying [0] had been aware of the film's message prior to screened.", "Segregating the federal bureaucracy": "[0]  is our person to focus on. By the 1910s, African Americans had become effectively shut out of elected office. Obtaining an executive appointment to a position within the federal bureaucracy was usually the only option for African-American statesmen. According to Berg, [0] continued to appoint African-Americans to positions that had traditionally been filled by black people, overcoming opposition from many southern senators. Oswald Garrison Villard, who later became an opponent of his, initially thought that [0] was not a bigot and supported progress for black people, and Oswald Garrison Villard, who later became an opponent of his, was frustrated by southern opposition in the Senate, to which [0] capitulated. In a conversation with [0], journalist John Palmer Gavit came to the realization that opposition to those views \"would certainly precipitate a conflict which would put a complete stop to any legislative program.\" Since the end of Reconstruction, both parties recognized certain appointments as unofficially reserved for qualified African-Americans. [0] appointed a total of nine African-Americans to prominent positions in the federal bureaucracy, eight of whom were Republican carry-overs. For comparison, William Howard Taft was met with disdain and outrage from Republicans of both parties for appointing thirty-one black officeholders, a record low for a Republican president. Upon taking office, [0] fired all but two of the seventeen black supervisors in the federal bureaucracy appointed by William Howard Taft.Since 1863, the U.S. mission to Haiti and Santo Domingo was almost always led by an African-American diplomat regardless of what party the sitting president belonged to; [0] ended this half-century-old tradition but continued to appoint black diplomats like George Washington Buckner, as well as Joseph L. Johnson, to head the mission to Liberia. Since the end of Reconstruction, the federal bureaucracy had been possibly the only career path where African-Americans could experience some measure of equality, and was the life blood and foundation of the black middle-class.Wilson's administration escalated the discriminatory hiring policies and segregation of government offices that had begun under Theodore Roosevelt and continued under William Howard Taft. In [0]'s first month in office, Postmaster General Albert S. Burleson urged [0] to establish segregated government offices. [0] did not adopt Postmaster General Albert S. Burleson's proposal but allowed Cabinet Secretaries discretion to segregate Cabinet Secretaries's respective departments. By the end of 1913, many departments, including the Senate, Treasury, and Post Office, had segregated work spaces, restrooms, and cafeterias. Many agencies used segregation as a pretext to adopt a whites-only employment policy, claiming Many agencies lacked facilities for black workers. In these instances, African-Americans employed prior to Wilson's administration were either offered early retirement, transferred, or simply fired.Racial discrimination in federal hiring increased further when after 1914, the United States Civil Service Commission instituted a new policy requiring job applicants to submit a personal photo with job applicants's application. As a federal enclave, Washington, D.C., had long offered African-Americans greater opportunities for employment and less glaring discrimination. In 1919, black veterans returning home to Washington, D.C., were shocked to discover Jim Crow laws had set in, many could not go back to the jobs many held prior to the war or even enter the same building many used to work in due to the color of many's skin. Booker T. Washington described the situation: \"Booker T. Washington had never seen the colored people so discouraged and bitter as the colored people are at the present time.\"", "African Americans in the armed forces": "[0]  is our person to focus on. While segregation had been present in the Army prior to [0], segregation's severity increased significantly under [0]'s election. During [0]'s first term, the the Army and Navy refused to commission new black officers. Black officers already serving experienced increased discrimination and were often forced out or discharged on dubious grounds. Following the entry of the U.S. into World War I, the War Department drafted hundreds of thousands of black people into the Army, and draftees were paid equally regardless of race. Commissioning of African-Americans officers resumed but units remained segregated and most all-black units were led by white officers.[page\u00a0needed]Unlike the Army, the U.S. Navy was never formally segregated. Following [0]'s appointment of Josephus Daniels as Secretary of the U.S. Navy, a system of Jim Crow was swiftly implemented; with ships, training facilities, restrooms, and cafeterias all becoming segregated. While Josephus Daniels significantly expanded opportunities for advancement and training available to white sailors, by the time the U.S. entered World War I, African-American sailors had been relegated almost entirely to mess and custodial duties, often assigned to act as servants for white officers.", "Response to racial violence": "Woodrow Wilson  is our person to focus on. In response to the demand for industrial labor, [0] surged in 1917 and 1918. [0] sparked race riots, including the East St. Louis riots of 1917. In response to the East St. Louis riots of 1917, but only after much public outcry, Woodrow Wilson asked Attorney General Thomas Watt Gregory if the federal government could intervene to \"check the East St. Louis riots of 1917\". On the advice of Attorney General Thomas Watt Gregory, Woodrow Wilson did not take direct action against the East St. Louis riots of 1917. In 1918, Woodrow Wilson spoke out against lynching in the federal government, stating: \"Woodrow Wilson say plainly that every American who takes part in the action of mob or gives the action of mob any sort of continence is no true son of the federal government but the federal government's betrayer, and ... [discredits] the federal government by that single disloyalty to the federal government's standards of law and of rights.\" In 1919, another series of race riots occurred in Chicago, Omaha, and two dozen other major cities in the North. the federal government did not become involved, just as the federal government had not become involved previously."}, "Legacy": {"Historical reputation": "Woodrow Wilson  is our person to focus on. [0] is generally ranked by historians and political scientists as an above average president. In the view of some historians, [0], more than any of [0]'s predecessors, took steps towards the creation of a strong federal government that would protect ordinary citizens against the overwhelming power of large corporations. [0] is generally regarded as a key figure in the establishment of modern American liberalism, and a strong influence on future presidents such as Franklin D. Roosevelt and Lyndon B. Johnson. Cooper argues that in terms of impact and ambition, only the New Deal and the Great Society rival the domestic accomplishments of Wilson's presidency. Many of [0]'s accomplishments, including the Federal Reserve, the Federal Trade Commission, the graduated income tax, and labor laws, continued to influence the United States long after [0]'s death.Many conservatives have attacked [0] for [0]'s role in expanding the United States. In 2018, conservative columnist George Will wrote in The Washington Post that Franklin D. Roosevelt and [0] were the \"progenitors of today's imperial presidency\". [0]'s idealistic foreign policy, which came to be known as Wilsonianism, also cast a long shadow over American foreign policy, and [0]'s League of Nations influenced the development of the United Nations. Saladin Ambar writes that [0] was \"the first statesman of world stature to speak out not only against European imperialism but against the newer form of economic domination sometimes described as 'informal imperialism.'\"Notwithstanding [0]'s accomplishments in office, [0] has received criticism for [0]'s record on race relations and civil liberties, for [0]'s interventions in Latin America, and for [0]'s failure to win ratification of the Treaty of Versailles. Despite [0]'s southern roots and record at Princeton, [0] became the first Democrat to receive widespread support from the African-American community in a presidential election. Wilson's African-American supporters, many of whom had crossed party lines to vote for him in 1912, found Wilson's African-American supporters, many of whom had crossed party lines to vote for him in 1912, bitterly disappointed by Wilson's presidency, [0]'s decision to allow the imposition of Jim Crow within the federal bureaucracy in particular.Ross Kennedy writes that [0]'s support of segregation complied with predominant public opinion. A. Scott Berg argues [0] accepted segregation as part of a policy to \"promote racial progress... by shocking the social system as little as possible.\" The ultimate result of a policy to \"promote racial progress... by shocking the social system as little as possible was unprecedented levels of segregation within the federal bureaucracy and far fewer opportunities for employment and promotion being open to African-Americans than before. Historian Kendrick Clements argues \"[0] had none of the crude, vicious racism of James K. Vardaman or Benjamin R. Tillman, but [0] was insensitive to African-American feelings and aspirations.\" A 2021 study in the Quarterly Journal of Economics found that [0]'s segregation of the civil service increased the black-white earnings gap by 3.4\u20136.9 percentage points, as existing black civil servants were driven to lower-paid positions. Black civil servants who were exposed to Wilson's segregationist policies experienced a relative decline in home ownership rates, with suggestive evidence of lasting adverse effects for the descendants of Black civil servants who were exposed to Wilson's segregationist policies.
