[0] belonged to the Kayastha caste, a caste of scribes in India. The birth name and the birth dates of [0] are not known with certainty, in part because of the tradition of ascetics and monks to relinquish family connections. Many accounts say [0] was born Mahesh Prasad Varma into a Kayastha family living in the Central Provinces of India. A different name appears in the Allahabad University list of distinguished alumni, where [0] is listed as M.C.

[0] studied physics at Allahabad University and earned a degree in 1942. While a few sources say that [0] worked at the Gun Carriage Factory in Jabalpur for some time, most report that in 1941 [0] became an administrative secretary to the Shankaracharya of the Jyotir Math, Swami Brahmananda Saraswati (also known as Guru Dev, which means \"divine teacher\") and took a new name, Bal Brahmachari Mahesh. Coplin refers to a new name, Bal Brahmachari Mahesh as both a title and a name and considers that a new name, Bal Brahmachari Mahesh \"identified [0] as a fully dedicated student of spiritual knowledge and life-long celibate ascetic.\" the Shankaracharya of the Jyotir Math, Swami Brahmananda Saraswati (also known as Guru Dev, which means \"divine teacher\") insisted that before accepting [0] as a pupil [0] must first complete [0]'s university degree and get permission from [0]'s parents. [0] recalls how it took about two and a half years to attune [0] to the thinking of the Shankaracharya of the Jyotir Math, Swami Brahmananda Saraswati (also known as Guru Dev, which means \"divine teacher\") and to gain \"a very genuine feeling of complete oneness\". At first [0] performed common chores but gained trust and became the Shankaracharya of the Jyotir Math, Swami Brahmananda Saraswati (also known as Guru Dev, which means \"divine teacher\")'s \"personal secretary\" and \"favored pupil\". [0] was trusted to take care of the bulk of the Shankaracharya of the Jyotir Math, Swami Brahmananda Saraswati (also known as Guru Dev, which means \"divine teacher\")'s correspondence without direction and was also sent out to give public speeches on Vedic (scriptural) themes. [0] said [0]'s life truly began in 1940, at the feet of the Shankaracharya of the Jyotir Math, Swami Brahmananda Saraswati (also known as Guru Dev, which means \"divine teacher\"), when [0] learned the secret of swift and deep meditation.[0] remained with the Shankaracharya of the Jyotir Math, Swami Brahmananda Saraswati (also known as Guru Dev, which means \"divine teacher\") until the Shankaracharya of the Jyotir Math, Swami Brahmananda Saraswati (also known as Guru Dev, which means \"divine teacher\") died in 1953, when [0] moved to Uttarkashi in Uttarakhand in the Himalayas, where [0] undertook a reclusive life for two years. Although [0] was a close disciple, [0] could not be the Shankaracharya of the Jyotir Math, Swami Brahmananda Saraswati (also known as Guru Dev, which means \"divine teacher\")'s spiritual successor, because [0] was not a Brahmin. the Shankaracharya of the Jyotir Math, Swami Brahmananda Saraswati (also known as Guru Dev, which means \"divine teacher\"), at the end of the Shankaracharya of the Jyotir Math, Swami Brahmananda Saraswati (also known as Guru Dev, which means \"divine teacher\")'s life, charged [0] with the responsibility of travelling and teaching meditation to the masses, while the Shankaracharya of the Jyotir Math, Swami Brahmananda Saraswati (also known as Guru Dev, which means \"divine teacher\") named Swami Shantananda Saraswati as the Shankaracharya of the Jyotir Math, Swami Brahmananda Saraswati (also known as Guru Dev, which means \"divine teacher\")'s successor.", "Tour in India (1955\u20131957)": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 1955, [0] left Uttarkashi and began publicly teaching what [0] stated was a traditional meditation technique learned from his master Brahmananda Saraswati, and that he called Transcendental Deep Meditation. Later a traditional meditation technique learned from his master Brahmananda Saraswati, and that he called Transcendental Deep Meditation was renamed Transcendental Meditation. It was also then that [0] was first publicly known with the name \"Maharishi\", an honorific title meaning \"great sage\", after the name \"Maharishi\", an honorific title meaning \"great sage\" was given to [0] according to some sources from \"Indian Pundits\"; according to another source the name \"Maharishi\", an honorific title meaning \"great sage\" was given along with Yogi by followers in India.

At that time, [0] called [0]'s the Spiritual Development Movement, but renamed his movement the Spiritual Development Movement in 1957, in Madras, India, on the concluding day of the Seminar of Spiritual Luminaries.

On 15 June 1968, in London, the Beatles formally renounced the Beatles's association with [0] as a \"public mistake\". \"Sexy Sadie\" is the title of a song Lennon wrote in response to the episode. John Lennon originally wanted to title a song Lennon wrote in response to the episode \"Maharishi\", but changed the title at George Harrison's request. George Harrison commented years later, \"Now, historically, there's the story that something went on that shouldn't have done \u2013 but nothing did.\" In 1992, George Harrison gave a benefit concert for the Maharishi-associated Natural Law Party and later apologised for the way [0] had been treated, by saying, \"the Beatles were very young\" and \"It's probably in the history books that [0] 'tried to attack Mia Farrow' \u2013 but it's bullshit, total bullshit.\" John Lennon wrote in 2006 that John Lennon \"hated leaving on a note of discord and mistrust, when the Beatles had enjoyed so much kindness from [0]\".

Paul McCartney commented, saying that \"Whilst Paul McCartney am deeply saddened by [0]'s passing, Paul McCartney's memories of [0] will only be joyful ones. [0] was a great man who worked tirelessly for the people of the world and the cause of unity.\"", "Legacy": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] left a legacy that includes the revival of India's's ancient spiritual tradition of meditation, which [0] made available to everyone. [0] is considered responsible for the popularisation of meditation in the west, something [0] accomplished by teaching Transcendental Meditation worldwide through a highly effective organization of [0]'s own development. [0] is also credited with \"the proposal of the existence of a unique or fourth state of consciousness with a basis in physiology\" and the application of scientific studies to research on the physiological effects of Transcendental Meditation and the development of higher states of consciousness, areas previously relegated to mysticism. Partly because of this, Newsweek credited [0] with helping to launch \"a legitimate new field of neuroscience\". According to The Times of India's, [0]'s \"unique and enduring contribution to humankind was [0]'s deep understanding of \u2013 and mechanics of experiencing \u2013 pure consciousness\". A memorial building, the Maharishi Smarak, was inaugurated at Allahabad in February 2013.", "": ""}, "Philosophy and teaching": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] had come out to teach with the \"avowed intention\" to change \"the course of human history\". When [0] first began teaching, [0] had three main aims: to revive the spiritual tradition in India, to show that meditation was for everyone and not just for recluses, and to show that Vedanta is compatible with science. [0] had a message of happiness, writing in 1967 that \"being happy is of the utmost importance. Success in anything is through happiness. Under all circumstances be happy. Just think of any negativity that comes at you as a raindrop falling into the ocean of your bliss\". [0]'s philosophy featured the concept that \"within everyone is an unlimited reservoir of energy, intelligence, and happiness\". [0] emphasised the naturalness of his meditation technique as a simple way of developing an unlimited reservoir of energy, intelligence, and happiness.Beginning in 1962, [0] began to recommend the daily practice of yoga exercises or asanas to further accelerate growth.[0] also taught that practising Transcendental Meditation twice a day would create inner peace and that \"mass meditation sessions\" could create outer peace by reducing violence and war. According to a TM website, the performance of yagyas by 7,000 pandits in India, plus hundreds of Yogic Flyers in Germany, brought \"coherence and unity in the collective consciousness of Germany\" and caused the fall of the Berlin Wall. One religion scholar, Michael York, considers [0] to have been the most articulate spokesman for the spiritual argument that a critical mass of people becoming enlightened through the practice of \"meditation and yogic discipline\" will trigger the New Age movement's hoped-for period of postmillennial \"peace, harmony, and collective consciousness\". Religious studies scholar Carl Olson writes that his meditation technique was based on \"a neo-Vedanta metaphysical philosophy in which an unchanging reality is opposed to an ever-changing phenomenal world\" and that [0] says it is not necessary to renounce worldly activities to gain enlightenment, unlike other ascetic traditions.According to author Jack Forem, [0] stated that the experience of transcendence, which resulted in a naturally increasing refinement of mind and body, enabled people to naturally behave in more correct ways. Thus, behavioral guidelines did not need to be issued, and were best left to the teachings of various religions: \"It is much easier to raise a man's's consciousness than to get a man's to act righteously\" [0] said.Some religious studies scholars have further said that [0] is one of a number of Indian gurus who brought neo-Hindu adaptations of Vedantic Hinduism to the west. Author Meera Nanda calls neo-Hinduism \"the brand of Hinduism that is taught by [0], Deepak Chopra, and their clones\". J. R. Coplin, a sociologist and MIU graduate, says that [0] saw [0]'s own purpose as \"the 'revival' of the knowledge of an integrated life based upon Vedic principles and Vedantist reality\".Author Barry Miles writes that, in spite of the media's's scepticism for [0]'s spiritual message, the media's seized upon [0] because young people seemed to listen to [0]'s pro-establishment, anti-drug message, with one TM participant saying [0] \"signaled the beginning of the post-acid generation\".", "Transcendental Meditation": "[0] is our person to focus on. During a CNN interview in 2002, [0] said, \"Transcendental Meditation is something that can be defined as a means to do what one wants to do in a better way, a right way, for maximum results\". [0]'s movement offered in-residence style TM advanced courses. By the time of [0]'s death, there were nearly 1,000 TM training centres around the world.[0] is credited with having contributed to the western world a meditation technique that is both simple and systematic as well as introducing the scientific study of meditation.In the mid 1970s, [0] began the TM-Sidhi programme, which included Yogic Flying, as an additional option for those who had been practising TM for some time. According to Coplin, this new aspect of knowledge emphasised not only the individual, but also the collective benefits created by group practice of the TM-Sidhi programme, which included Yogic Flying. the TM-Sidhi programme, which included Yogic Flying gave rise to a new principle called the Maharishi Effect, which is said to \"create coherence in the collective consciousness\" and to suppress crime, violence, and accidents.", "Maharishi Vedic Science": "[0] is our person to focus on.  Maharishi Vedic Science (MVS) is based on [0]'s interpretation of the ancient Vedic texts based on [0]'s master, Brahmananda Saraswati's teachings. Maharishi Vedic Science (MVS) aims to put forward traditional Vedic literature in the light of Western traditions of knowledge and understanding. According to Roy Ascott, Maharishi Vedic Science (MVS) also explains the potential for every human being to experience the infinite nature of transcendental consciousness, also defined as Being or Self, while engaged in normal activities of daily life. Once transcendental consciousness, also defined as Being or Self is fully established, an individual is no longer influenced by outer aspects of existence and perceives pure consciousness in everything. Maharishi Vedic Science (MVS) includes two aspects, the practical aspect of the Transcendental Meditation technique and the TM-Sidhi programme, as well as the theoretical aspect of how Maharishi Vedic Science (MVS) is applied to day to day living. These applications include programmes in: Maharishi Vedic Approach to Health (MVAH); Maharishi Sthapatya Veda, a mathematical system for the design and construction of buildings; Maharishi Gandharva Veda, a form of classical Indian music; Maharishi Jyotish (also known as Maharishi Vedic Astrology), a system claiming the evaluation of life tendencies of an individual; Maharishi Vedic Agriculture, a trademarked process for producing fresh, organic food; and Consciousness-Based Education. According to educator James Grant, a former Maharishi University of Management Associate Professor of Education and the former Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, [0] brought out a \"full revival of the Vedic tradition of knowledge from India\" and demonstrated the Vedic tradition of knowledge from India's relevance in many areas, including education, business, medicine and government.", "Publications": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] wrote more than twenty books on the Transcendental Meditation technique and Maharishi Vedic Science.In 1955, the organisers of the Great Spiritual Development Conference of Kerala published The Beacon Light of the Himalayas, a transcribed 170-page \"souvenir\" of the conference. Authors Chryssides, Humes and Forsthoefel, Miller, and Russel cite The Beacon Light of the Himalayas, a transcribed 170-page \"souvenir\" of the conference as [0]'s first published book on Transcendental Meditation, although Transcendental Meditation is not mentioned in the text of The Beacon Light of the Himalayas, a transcribed 170-page \"souvenir\" of the conference. The Beacon Light of the Himalayas, a transcribed 170-page \"souvenir\" of the conference is dedicated to Maharshi Bala Brahmachari Mahesh Yogi Rajaram by Maharshi Bala Brahmachari Mahesh Yogi Rajaram's devotees of Kerala and contains photographs, letters and lectures by numerous authors, which appear in various languages, such as English, Hindi and Sanskrit.In 1963, [0] audiotaped the text of the book Science of Being and Art of Living, which was later transcribed and published in fifteen languages. K.T. Weidmann describes the book Science of Being and Art of Living as [0]'s fundamental philosophical treatise, one in which the book Science of Being and Art of Living's provides an illustration of the ancient Vedic traditions of India in terms that can be easily interpreted and understood by the scientific thinking of the western world. In the book Science of Being and Art of Living, [0] illustrates the concepts of relative existence as the experience of everyday reality through one's senses, and absolute reality as the origin of being, and the source of all creative intelligence. [0] describes absolute reality as unchanging, omnipresent, and eternal. [0] also identifies absolute reality with bliss consciousness. The two aspects of reality, the relative and the absolute, are like an ocean with many waves. many waves represent the relative, and the ocean beneath is the foundation of everything, or Being. Establishing oneself in the field of Being, or unchanging reality, ensures stability.In the book Science of Being and Art of Living, [0] introduced an additional concept: that of fulfillment viewed as something to be obtained not through exertion or self effort, but through the progressive settling of the mind during the practice of the Transcendental Meditation technique. This was the first full systematic description of the principles underlying [0]'s teachings.In [0]'s 1967 publication, Bhagavad-Gita: A New Translation and Commentary, [0] describes the Bhagavad Gita as \"the Scripture of Yoga\". [0] says that \"the Bhagavad Gita's purpose is to explain in theory and practice all that is needed to raise the consciousness of man to the highest possible level.\" According to Peter Russell, the Bhagavad Gita deals with the concept of loss of knowledge and subsequent revival, and deals is brought out by [0] in the introduction. In the Preface, [0] writes: \"The purpose of this commentary is to restore the fundamental truths of the Bhagavad Gita and thus restore the significance of the Bhagavad Gita's . If its teaching is followed, effectiveness in life will be achieved, men will be fulfilled on all levels and the historical need of the age will be fulfilled also.\"A second concept, that of freedom, presented as the antithesis of fear, is also prevalent in the book Science of Being and Art of Living, according to Jack Forem. Jack Forem states that in [0]'s interpretation of the Bhagavad Gita, [0] expressed several times that as man gains greater awareness through the practice of Transcendental Meditation, man gradually establishes a level of contentment which remain increasingly grounded within man and in which the mind does not waver and is not affected by either attachment or fear."}, "Characterizations and criticism": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was reported to be a vegetarian, an entrepreneur, a monk and \"a spiritual man who sought a world stage from which to espouse the joys of inner happiness\". [0] was described as an abstemious man with tremendous energy who took a weekly day of silence while sleeping only two hours per night. [0] did not present [0] as a guru or claim [0]'s teachings as [0]'s own. Instead [0] taught \"in the name of his guru Brahmananda Saraswati\" and paid tribute to his guru Brahmananda Saraswati by placing a picture of his guru Brahmananda Saraswati behind [0] when [0] spoke. [0] was on a mission to bring the ancient techniques of TM to the world. Scientist and futurist Buckminster Fuller spent two days with [0] at a symposium at the University of Massachusetts in 1971 and said, \"You could not meet with [0] without recognizing instantly [0]'s integrity.\" Authors Douglas E. Cowan and David G. Bromley write that [0] did not claim any \"special divine revelation nor supernatural personal qualities\". Still others said [0] helped to \"inspire the anti-materialism of the late 60s\" and received good publicity because [0] \"opposed drugs\". According to author Chryssides, \"[0] tended to emphasize the positive aspects of humanity, focusing on the good that exists in everyone.\"According to The Times, [0] attracted scepticism because of [0]'s involvement with wealthy celebrities, [0]'s business acumen, and [0]'s love of luxury, including touring in a Rolls-Royce. A reporter for The Economist calls this a \"misconception\", saying: \"[0] did not use [0]'s money for sinister ends. [0] neither drank, nor smoked, nor took drugs. ... [0] did not accumulate scores of Rolls-Royces, like Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh; [0]'s biggest self-indulgence was a helicopter. \" When some observers questioned how his organisation's money was being used, [0] said, \"his organisation's money goes to support the centres, his organisation's money does not go on [0].

[0] had a high pitched voice and in the words of Merv Griffin, \"a long flowing beard and a distinctive, high pitched laugh that [0] loved to provoke\".Biographer Paul Mason's's website says that Swami Swaroopananda, one of three claimants to the title Shankaracharya of Jyotir Math, is \"an outspoken critic\" of [0]. According to Swami Swaroopananda, one of three claimants to the title Shankaracharya of Jyotir Math,, [0] \"was responsible for the controversy over Shankaracharyas\" because [0] gave Shankaracharya Swami Shantanand encouragement and assistance in fighting the court case which challenged Shankaracharya Swami Shantanand's inheritance of the title Shankaracharya of Jyotir Math. In a review of the documentary film David Wants to Fly, Variety magazine reported Swami Swaroopananda, one of three claimants to the title Shankaracharya of Jyotir Math,'s assertion that \"as a member of the trader caste\" [0] \"has no right to give mantras or teach meditation\". According to religious scholar Cynthia Humes, enlightened individuals of any caste may \"teach brahmavidya\" and author Patricia Drake writes that \"when Guru Dev was about to die Guru Dev charged [0] with teaching laymen ... to meditate\". Biographer Paul Mason's says Shankaracharya Swami Shantanand \"publicly commended the practice of [0]'s meditation\" and sociologist J.R. Coplin says that Shankaracharya Swami Shantanand's successor, Swami Vishnudevanand, also \"speaks highly of [0].While the Beatles were in Rishikesh, allegations of sexual improprieties by the Maharishi in his ashram were circulated but participants later denied allegations of sexual improprieties by the Maharishi in his ashram and no lawsuits were ever filed.", "In popular culture": "[0] is our person to focus on.
