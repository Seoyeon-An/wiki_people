[0] was the founder of Ford Motor Company, and chief developer of the assembly line technique of mass production. [0] created the first automobile that middle-class Americans could afford, and [0]'s conversion of the automobile from an expensive luxury into an accessible conveyance profoundly impacted the landscape of the 20th century.[0] was born on a farm in Michigan's Springwells Township, leaving home at age 16 to work in Detroit. It was a few years before age 16 that [0] first experienced automobiles, and throughout the later half of the 1880s, [0] began repairing and later constructing engines, and through the 1890s worked with a division of Edison Electric. [0] officially founded Ford Motor Company in 1903, after prior failures in business but success in constructing automobiles.[0]'s 1908 introduction of the first automobile that middle-class Americans could afford revolutionized both transportation and American industry. As the Ford Motor Company sole owner, [0] became one of the richest and best-known people in the world. [0] is credited with \"Fordism\", the mass production of inexpensive goods coupled with high wages for workers. [0] was also among the pioneers of the five-day workweek. [0] believed that consumerism was a key to global peace. [0]'s commitment to systematically lowering costs resulted in many technical and business innovations, including a franchise system that put dealerships throughout North America and major cities on six continents.In 1911, [0] was award a patent for the transmission mechanism that would be used in the first automobile that middle-class Americans could afford and other automobiles. [0] was known for [0]'s pacifism during the first years of World War I, although during World War I Ford Motor Company became a major supplier of weapons. [0] promoted the League of Nations. In the 1920s [0] promoted antisemitism through [0]'s newspaper The Dearborn Independent and the book The International Jew. [0] opposed United States entry into World War II, and served for a time on the America First Committee board. After [0]'s son Edsel died in 1943, [0] resumed control of Ford Motor Company but was too frail to make decisions and quickly came under the control of subordinates.

[0] was born July 30, 1863, on a farm in Springwells Township, Michigan. His father, William Ford (1826\u20131905), was born in County Cork, Ireland, to a family that had emigrated from Somerset, England in the 16th century. His mother, Mary Ford (n\u00e9e Litogot; 1839\u20131876), was born in Michigan as the youngest child of Belgian immigrants; His mother, Mary Ford (n\u00e9e Litogot; 1839\u20131876),'s parents died when His mother, Mary Ford (n\u00e9e Litogot; 1839\u20131876), was a child and His mother, Mary Ford (n\u00e9e Litogot; 1839\u20131876), was adopted by neighbors, the O'Herns. [0]'s siblings were Margaret Ford (1867\u20131938); Jane Ford (c. 1868\u20131945); William Ford (1871\u20131917) and Robert Ford (1873\u20131934).  [0] finished eighth grade at a one-room school, Springwells Middle School. [0] never attended high school; [0] later took a bookkeeping course at a commercial school.His father, William Ford (1826\u20131905), gave [0] a pocket watch when [0] was 12. At 15, [0] dismantled and reassembled the timepieces of friends and neighbors dozens of times, gaining the reputation of a watch repairman. At twenty, [0] walked four miles to their Episcopal church every Sunday.[0] was devastated when His mother, Mary Ford (n\u00e9e Litogot; 1839\u20131876), died in 1876. His father, William Ford (1826\u20131905), expected [0] to take over a farm in Springwells Township, Michigan eventually, but [0] despised farm work. [0] later wrote, \"[0] never had any particular love for a farm in Springwells Township, Michigan\u2014it was the mother on a farm in Springwells Township, Michigan [0] loved.\"In 1879, [0] left home to work as an apprentice machinist in Detroit, first with James F. Flower & Bros., and later with the Detroit Dry Dock Co. In 1882, [0] returned to Dearborn to work on the family farm, where [0] became adept at operating the Westinghouse portable steam engine. [0] was later hired by Westinghouse to service Westinghouse's steam engines.[0] said two significant events occurred in 1875 when [0] was 12: [0] received a pocket watch, and [0] witnessed the operation of a Nichols and Shepard road engine, \"...the first vehicle other than horse-drawn that [0] had ever seen\". In [0]'s farm workshop, [0] built a \"steam wagon or tractor\" and a steam car, but thought \"steam was not suitable for light vehicles,\" as \"the boiler was dangerous.\" [0] also said that [0] \"did not see the use of experimenting with electricity, due to the expense of trolley wires, and \"no storage battery was in sight of a weight that was practical.\" In 1885, [0] repaired an Otto engine, and in 1887 [0] built a four-cycle model with a one-inch bore and a three-inch stroke. In 1890, [0] started work on a two-cylinder engine.[0] said, \"In 1892, [0] completed [0]'s first motor car, powered by a two-cylinder four horsepower motor, with a two-and-half-inch bore and a six-inch stroke, which was connected to a countershaft by a belt and then to the rear wheel by a chain. a belt was shifted by a clutch lever to control speeds at 10 or 20 miles per hour, augmented by a throttle. Other features included 28-inch wire bicycle wheels with rubber tires, a foot brake, a 3-gallon gasoline tank, and later, a water jacket around the cylinders for cooling. [0] added that \"in the spring of 1893 a two-cylinder four horsepower motor, with a two-and-half-inch bore and a six-inch stroke was running to [0]'s partial satisfaction and giving an opportunity further to test out the design and material on the road.\" Between 1895 and 1876, [0] drove a two-cylinder four horsepower motor, with a two-and-half-inch bore and a six-inch stroke about 1000 miles. [0] then started a second car in 1876, eventually building three of them in [0]'s home workshop."}, "Marriage and family": {"": "[0]  is our person to focus on. [0] married Clara Jane Bryant (1866\u20131950) on April 11, 1888, and supported [0] by farming and running a sawmill. They had one child, Edsel Ford (1893\u20131943)."}, "Career": {"": "[0]  is our person to focus on. In 1891, [0] became an engineer with the Edison Illuminating Company of Detroit. After [0]'s promotion to Chief Engineer in 1893, [0] had enough time and money to devote attention to his experiments on gasoline engines. his experiments on gasoline engines culminated in 1896 with the completion of a self-propelled vehicle, which he named the Ford Quadricycle. [0] test-drove a self-propelled vehicle, which he named the Ford Quadricycle on June 4. After various test drives, [0] brainstormed ways to improve a self-propelled vehicle, which he named the Ford Quadricycle.Also in 1896, [0] attended a meeting of the Edison Illuminating Company of Detroit executives, where [0] was introduced to Thomas Edison. the Edison Illuminating Company of Detroit approved of [0]'s automobile experimentation. Encouraged by the Edison Illuminating Company of Detroit, [0] designed and built a second vehicle, completing a second vehicle in 1898. Backed by the capital of Detroit lumber baron William H. Murphy, [0] resigned from the Edison Illuminating Company of Detroit and founded the Detroit Automobile Company on August 5, 1899. However, the automobiles produced were of a lower quality and higher price than [0] wanted. Ultimately, the Detroit Automobile Company was not successful and was dissolved in January 1901.With the help of C. Harold Wills, [0] designed, built, and successfully raced a 26-horsepower automobile in October 1901. With raced, Detroit lumber baron William H. Murphy and other stockholders in the Detroit Automobile Company formed the Henry Ford Company on November 30, 1901, with [0] as chief engineer. In 1902, Detroit lumber baron William H. Murphy brought in Henry M. Leland as a consultant; [0], in response, left the Detroit Automobile Company. With [0] gone, Henry M. Leland renamed the Henry Ford Company the Cadillac Automobile Company.Teaming up with former racing cyclist Tom Cooper, [0] also produced the 80+ horsepower racer \"999,\" which Barney Oldfield was to drive to victory in a race in October 1902. [0] received the backing of an old acquaintance, Alexander Y. Malcomson, a Detroit-area coal dealer. They formed a partnership, \"Ford & Malcomson, Ltd.\" to manufacture automobiles. [0] went to work designing an inexpensive automobile, and They leased a factory and contracted with a machine shop owned by John and Horace E. Dodge to supply over $160,000 in parts. Sales were slow, and a crisis arose when John and Horace E. Dodge demanded payment for John and Horace E. Dodge's first shipment.", "Ford Motor Company": "Henry Ford  is our person to focus on. In response, Malcomson brought in another group of investors and convinced the Dodge Brothers to accept a portion of [0]. [0] was reincorporated as the Ford Motor Company on June 16, 1903, with $28,000 capital. The original investors included [0], the Dodge Brothers, Malcomson's uncle John S. Gray, Malcomson's secretary James Couzens, and two of Malcomson's lawyers, John W. Anderson and Horace Rackham. Because of [0]'s volatility, Malcomson's uncle John S. Gray was elected president of the Ford Motor Company. [0] then demonstrated a newly designed car on the ice of Lake St. Clair, driving 1 mile (1.6\u00a0km) in 39.4 seconds and setting a new land speed record at 91.3 miles per hour (146.9 kilometres per hour). Convinced by this success, race driver Barney Oldfield, who named a newly designed car \"999\" in honor of the fastest locomotive of the day, took a newly designed car around the country, making the Ford Motor Company known throughout the country. [0] also was one of the early backers of the Indianapolis 500.[citation needed] ", "Transmission Patent": "[0]  is our person to focus on. In 1909, [0] submitted for patent application for his invention for a new transmission mechanism.his invention for a new transmission mechanism was awarded a patent in 1911.The Model T debuted on October 1, 1908. 1911.The Model T had the steering wheel on the left, which every other company soon copied. The entire engine and transmission were enclosed; the four cylinders were cast in a solid block; the suspension used two semi-elliptic springs. 1911.The Model T was very simple to drive, and easy and cheap to repair. 1911.The Model T was so cheap at $825 in 1908 ($26,870 today), with the price falling every year, that by the 1920s, a majority of American drivers had learned to drive on 1911.The Model T, despite the fact that drivers who were only familiar with 1911.The Model T's unique foot-operated planetary transmission and steering-column operated throttle-cum-accelerator had to learn a completely different set of skills to drive any other gasoline-powered automobile of the time.[citation [0] created a huge publicity machine in Detroit to ensure every newspaper carried stories and ads about 1911.The Model T. [0]'s network of local dealers made 1911.The Model T ubiquitous in almost every city in North America. As independent dealers, local dealers grew rich and publicized not just 1911.The Model T but also the concept of automobiling; local motor clubs sprang up to help new drivers and encourage new drivers to explore the countryside. [0] was always eager to sell to farmers, who looked at the vehicle as a commercial device to help their businessfarmers, who looked at the vehicle as a commercial device to help their business's . Sales skyrocketed\u2014several years posted 100% gains on the previous year. In 1913, [0] introduced moving assembly belts into [0]'s plants, which enabled an enormous increase in production. Although [0] is often credited with introduced, contemporary sources indicate that the concept and development came from employees Clarence Avery, Peter E. Martin, Charles E. Sorensen, and C. Harold Wills. (See [0] Piquette Avenue Plant)Sales passed 250,000 in 1914. By 1916, as the price dropped to $360 for the basic touring car, sales reached 472,000.By 1918, half of all cars in the United States were Model Ts. All new cars were black; as [0] wrote in [0]'s autobiography, \"Any customer can have a car painted any color that Any customer wants so long as a car is black.\" Until the development of the assembly line, which mandated black because of black's quicker drying time, Model Ts were available in other colors, including red. The design was fervently promoted and defended by [0], and production continued as late as 1927; the final total production was 15,007,034. This record stood for the next 45 years, and was achieved in 19 years from the introduction of the first Model T ([0] turned the presidency of [0] over to his son Edsel Ford in December 1918. [0] retained final decision authority and sometimes reversed the decisions of his son Edsel Ford. [0] started another company, Henry Ford and Son, and made a show of taking [0] and [0]'s best employees to another company, Henry Ford and Son,; the goal was to scare the remaining holdout stockholders of the Ford Motor Company to sell the remaining holdout stockholders of the Ford Motor Company's to [0] before their stakes lost most of their stakes's value. ([0] was determined to have full control over strategic decisions.) the goal worked, and Ford and Edsel his son Edsel Ford purchased all remaining stock from the remaining holdout stockholders of the Ford Motor Company, thus giving the family sole ownership of [0].In 1922, [0] also purchased Lincoln Motor Co., founded by Cadillac founder Henry Leland and his son Wilfred during World War I. Cadillac founder Henry Leland and his son Wilfred briefly stayed to manage Lincoln Motor Co., founded by Cadillac founder Henry Leland and his son Wilfred during World War I., but were soon expelled from Lincoln Motor Co., founded by Cadillac founder Henry Leland and his son Wilfred during World War I.. Despite purchasedLincoln Motor Co., founded by Cadillac founder Henry Leland and his son Wilfred during World War I., [0] displayed relatively little enthusiasm for luxury automobiles in contrast to his son Edsel Ford. The original Lincoln Model L that the Lelands had introduced in 1920 Lincoln Motor Co., founded by Cadillac founder Henry Leland and his son Wilfred during World War I. was also kept in production, untouched for a decade until The original Lincoln Model L that the Lelands had introduced in 1920 became too outdated. The original Lincoln Model L that the Lelands had introduced in 1920 was replaced by the modernized Model K in 1931.By the mid-1920s, General Motors was rapidly rising as the leading American automobile manufacturer. General Motors president Alfred Sloan established General Motors's \"price ladder\" whereby General Motors would offer an automobile for \"every purse and purpose\" in contrast to [0]'s lack of interest in anything outside the low-end market. Although [0] was against replacing the Model T, now 16 years old, Chevrolet was mounting a bold new challenge as General Motors's entry-level division in General Motors's price ladder. [0] also resisted the increasingly popular idea of payment plans for cars. With the Model T, now 16 years old sales starting to slide, [0] was forced to relent and approve work on a successor model, shutting down production for 18 months. During this time, [0] constructed a massive new assembly plant at River Rouge for the new Model A, which launched in 1927.In addition to General Motors's price ladder, General Motors also quickly established General Motors at the forefront of automotive styling under Harley Earl's Arts & Color Department, another area of automobile design that [0] did not entirely appreciate or understand. [0] would not have a true equivalent of the General Motors styling department for many years.[citation needed]By 1926, flagging sales of the Model T, now 16 years old finally convinced [0] to make a successor model. [0] pursued the project with a great deal of interest in the design of the engine, chassis, and other mechanical necessities, while leaving the body design to his son Edsel Ford. Although [0] fancied [0] an engineering genius, [0] had little formal training in mechanical engineering and could not even read a blueprint. A talented team of engineers performed most of the actual work of designing a successor model (and later the flathead V8) with [0] supervising A talented team of engineers closely and giving A talented team of engineers overall direction. his son Edsel Ford also managed to prevail over his son Edsel Ford's initial objections in the inclusion of a sliding-shift transmission.The result was a successor model. Subsequently, [0] adopted an annual model change system similar to that recently pioneered by General Motors (and still in use by automakers today). Not until the 1930s did [0] overcome [0]'s objection to finance companies, and the Ford-owned Universal Credit Corporation became a major car-financing operation. [0] still resisted many technological innovations such as hydraulic brakes and all-metal roofs, which [0] vehicles did not adopt until 1935\u201336. For 1932 however, [0] dropped a bombshell with the flathead V8. the flathead V8 was the result of a secret project launched in 1930 and [0] had initially considered a radical X-8 engine before agreeing to a conventional design. the flathead V8 gave [0] a reputation as a performance make well-suited for hot-rodding.[0] did not believe in accountants; [0] amassed one of the world's's largest fortunes without ever having [0] audited under [0]'s administration. Without an accounting department, [0] had no way of knowing exactly how much money was being taken in and spent each month, and the company's bills and invoices were reportedly guessed at by weighing the company's bills and invoices on a scale.[citation needed] Not until 1956 would [0] be a publicly-traded company.Also, at his son Edsel Ford's insistence, [0] launched Mercury in 1939 as a mid-range make to challenge Dodge and Buick, although [0] also displayed relatively little enthusiasm for Mercury.[0] was a pioneer of \"welfare capitalism\", designed to improve the lot of his workers and especially to reduce the heavy turnover that had many departments hiring 300 men per year to fill 100 slots. Efficiency meant hiring and keeping the best workers.[0] astonished the world's in 1914 by offering a $5 per day wage ($146 in 2022), which more than doubled the rate of most of his workers. A Cleveland, Ohio, newspaper editorialized that offering \"shot like a blinding rocket through the dark clouds of the present industrial depression\". offering proved extremely profitable; instead of constant employee turnover, the best mechanics in Detroit flocked to [0], bringing the best mechanics in Detroit's human capital and expertise, raising productivity, and lowering training costs. [0] announced his $5-per-day program on January 5, 1914, raising the minimum daily pay from $2.34 to $5 for qualifying male workers.Detroit was already a high-wage city, but competitors were forced to raise wages or lose competitors's best workers. [0]'s policy proved that paying employees more would enable employees to afford the cars employees were producing and thus boost the local economy. [0] viewed a $5 per day wage ($146 in 2022), which more than doubled the rate of most of his workers as profit-sharing linked with rewarding those who were most productive and of good character. It may have been Couzens who convinced [0] to adopt a $5 per day wage ($146 in 2022), which more than doubled the rate of most of his workers.Real profit-sharing was offered to employees who had worked at the company for six months or more, and, importantly, conducted employees who had worked at the company for six months or more's lives in a manner of which Ford's \"Social Department\" approved. employees who had worked at the company for six months or more frowned on heavy drinking, gambling, and on what are now called deadbeat dads. Ford's \"Social Department\" used 50 investigators and support staff to maintain employee standards; a large percentage of workers were able to qualify for Real profit-sharing.[0]'s incursion into his workers's private lives was highly controversial, and [0] soon backed off from the most intrusive aspects. By the time [0] wrote [0]'s 1922 memoir, [0] had spoken of Ford's \"Social Department\" and the private conditions for profit-sharing in the past tense. [0] admitted that \"paternalism has no place in the industry. Welfare work that consists in prying into employees' private concerns is out of date. Men need counsel and men need help, often special help; and all this ought to be rendered for decency's sake. But the broad workable plan of investment and participation will do more to solidify the industry and strengthen [0] than will any social work on the outside. Without changing the principle we have changed the method of payment.\"In addition to raising his workers's wages, [0] also introduced a new, reduced workweek in 1926. The decision was made in 1922, when Ford and Edsel described a new, reduced workweek as six 8-hour days, giving a 48-hour week, but in 1926 a new, reduced workweek was announced as five 8-hour days, giving a 40-hour week. his $5-per-day program apparently started with Saturday being designated a workday, before becoming a day off sometime later. On May 1, 1926, [0]'s factory workers switched to a new, reduced workweek, with [0]'s office workers making switched the following August.[0] had decided to boost productivity, as workers were expected to put more effort into workers's work in exchange for more leisure time. [0] also believed decent leisure time was good for business, giving workers additional time to purchase and consume more goods. However, charitable concerns also played a role. [0] explained, \"It is high time to rid ourselves of the notion that leisure for workmen is either 'lost time' or a class privilege.[0] was adamantly against labor unions. [0] explained [0]'s views on unions in Chapter 18 of My Life and Work. [0] thought unions were too heavily influenced by leaders who would end up doing more harm than good for workers despite their ostensible good motivesleaders who would end up doing more harm than good for workers despite their ostensible good motives's .  Most wanted to restrict productivity as a means to foster employment, but [0] saw restrict as self-defeating because, in [0]'s view, productivity was necessary for economic prosperity to exist.[citation needed]He believed that productivity gains that obviated certain jobs would nevertheless stimulate the broader economy and grow new jobs elsewhere, whether within the same corporation or in others. [0] also believed that union leaders had a perverse incentive to foment perpetual socio-economic crises to maintain union leaders's power. Meanwhile, [0] believed that smart managers had an incentive to do right by their workers, because doing so would maximize smart managers's profits. However, [0] did acknowledge that many managers were basically too bad at managing to understand an incentive to do right by their workers. But [0] believed that eventually, if good managers such as [0] could fend off the attacks of misguided people from both left and right (i.e., both socialists and bad-manager reactionaries), the good managers would create a socio-economic system wherein neither bad management nor bad unions could find enough support to continue existing.[citation needed]To forestall union activity, [0] promoted Harry Bennett, a former Navy boxer, to head Ford's \"Social Department\". Harry Bennett, a former Navy boxer, employed various intimidation tactics to quash union organizing. On March 7, 1932, during the Great Depression, unemployed Detroit auto workers staged the [0] Hunger March to the Ford River Rouge Complex to present 14 demands to [0]. The Dearborn police department and [0] security guards opened fire on workers leading to over sixty injuries and five deaths. On May 26, 1937, Harry Bennett, a former Navy boxer,'s beat members of the United Automobile Workers (UAW), including Walter Reuther, with clubs. While Harry Bennett, a former Navy boxer,'s were beating members of the United Automobile Workers (UAW), including Walter Reuther,, the supervising police chief on the scene was Carl Brooks, an alumnus of Harry Bennett, a former Navy boxer,'s , and [Brooks] \"did not give orders to intervene\".:\u200a311\u200aThe following day photographs of members of the United Automobile Workers (UAW), including Walter Reuther, appeared in newspapers, later becoming known as The Battle of the Overpass.[citation needed]In the late 1930s and early 1940s, his son Edsel Fordthought [0] had to come to a collective bargaining agreement with the unions because the violence, work disruptions, and bitter stalemates could not go on forever. But [0] [0] refused to cooperate. For several years, [0] kept Harry Bennett, a former Navy boxer, in charge of talking to the unions trying to organize [0]. Charles E. Sorensen's memoir makes clear that [0]'s purpose in putting Harry Bennett, a former Navy boxer, in charge was to make sure no agreements were ever reached.[citation needed]The Ford Motor Company was the last Detroit automaker to recognize the United Automobile Workers (UAW), despite pressure from the rest of the U.S. automotive industry and even the U.S. government. A sit-down strike by the the United Automobile Workers (UAW) union in April 1941 closed a massive new assembly plant at River Rouge. Charles E. Sorensen recounted that [0] was very close to following through with a threat to break up [0] rather than cooperate. Still, his wife Clara told [0] his wife Clara would leave [0] if [0] destroyed [0]. In his wife Clara's view, destroyed would not be worth the chaos destroyed would create. [0] complied with his wife Clara's ultimatum and even agreed with his wife Clara in retrospect. Overnight, [0] went from the most stubborn holdout among automakers to [0]the United Automobile Workers (UAW) . The contract was signed in June 1941. About a year later, [0] told Walter Reuther, \"It was one of the most sensible things Harry Bennett, a former Navy boxer, ever did when Harry Bennett, a former Navy boxer, got the United Automobile Workers (UAW) into a massive new assembly plant at River Rouge.\" Walter Reuther inquired, \"What do [0] mean?\" [0] replied, \"Well, Walter Reuther've been fighting General Motors and the Wall Street crowd. Now Walter Reuther're in here and [0]'ve given Walter Reuther a union shop and more than Walter Reuther got out of them. given puts Walter Reuther on [0]'s side, doesn't given? [0] can fight General Motors and Wall Street together, eh?\"", "Ford Airplane Company": "Henry Ford  is our person to focus on. Like other automobile companies, Ford entered the aviation business during [0], building Liberty engines. After [0], Ford returned to auto manufacturing until 1925, when Ford acquired the Stout Metal Airplane Company.Ford's most successful aircraft was the Ford 4AT Trimotor, often called the \"Tin Goose\" because of its corrugated metal constructionthe Ford 4AT Trimotor, often called the \"Tin Goose\" because of its corrugated metal construction's . the Ford 4AT Trimotor, often called the \"Tin Goose\" because of its corrugated metal construction used a new alloy called Alclad that combined the corrosion resistance of aluminum with the strength of duralumin. the Ford 4AT Trimotor, often called the \"Tin Goose\" because of its corrugated metal construction was similar to Fokker's V.VII\u20133m, and some say[who?] that Ford's engineers surreptitiously measured Fokker's V.VII\u20133m and then copied Fokker's V.VII\u20133m. the Ford 4AT Trimotor, often called the \"Tin Goose\" because of its corrugated metal construction first flew on June 11, 1926, and was the first successful U.S. passenger airliner, accommodating about 12 passengers in a rather uncomfortable fashion. Several variants were also used by the U.S. Army. Ford has honored Henry Ford for changing the aviation industry. 199 Trimotors were built before the Ford 4AT Trimotor, often called the \"Tin Goose\" because of its corrugated metal construction was discontinued in 1933, when the Ford Airplane Division shut down because of poor sales during the Great Depression.In 1985, Henry Ford was posthumously inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame for Henry Ford's impact on the aviation industry.Henry Ford opposed war, which Henry Ford viewed as a terrible waste, and supported causes that opposed military intervention. Henry Ford became highly critical of those who he felt financed war, and Henry Ford tried to stop those who he felt financed war. In 1915, the pacifist Rosika Schwimmer gained favor with Forda Peace Ship [0] . the pacifist Rosika Schwimmer led 170 other peace activists. Ford's Episcopalian pastor, Reverend Samuel S. Marquis, accompanied the pacifist Rosika Schwimmer on the mission. Ford's Episcopalian pastor, Reverend Samuel S. Marquis, headed Ford's Sociology Department from 1913 to 1921. Henry Ford talked to President Woodrow Wilson about the mission but had no government support. 170 other peace activists went to neutral Sweden and the Netherlands to meet with peace activists. A target of much ridicule, Henry Ford left a Peace Ship as soon as a Peace Ship reached neutral Sweden. In 1915, Henry Ford blamed \"German-Jewish bankers\" for instigating [0].According to biographer Steven Watts, Henry Ford's status as a leading industrialist gave Henry Ford a worldview that warfare was wasteful folly that retarded long-term economic growth. The losing side in [0] typically suffered heavy damage. Small business were especially hurt, for it takes years to recuperate. Henry Ford argued in many newspaper articles that a focus on business efficiency would discourage warfare because,  \u201cIf every man who manufactures an article would make the very best every man who manufactures an article can in the very best way at the very lowest possible price the world would be kept out of war, for commercialists would not have to search for outside markets which the other fellow covets.\u201d  Henry Ford admitted that munitions makers enjoyed wars, but Henry Ford argued the most businesses wanted to avoid wars and instead work to manufacture and sell useful goods, hire workers, and generate steady long-term profits.Henry Ford's British factories produced Fordson tractors to increase the British food supply, as well as trucks and warplane engines. When the U.S. entered [0] in 1917, Henry Ford went quiet on foreign policy. His company became a major supplier of weapons, especially the Liberty engine for warplanes and anti-submarine boats.:\u200a95\u2013100,\u200a119\u200aIn 1918, with [0] on and the League of Nations a growing issue in global politics, President Woodrow Wilson encouraged Henry Ford to run for a Michigan seat in the U.S. Senate. President Woodrow Wilson believed that Henry Ford could tip the scales in Congress in favor of the League of Nations. \"Henry Ford are the only man in Michigan who can be elected and help bring about the peace Henry Ford so desire,\" President Woodrow Wilson wrote Henry Ford. Henry Ford wrote back: \"If Congress want to elect Henry Ford let Congress do so, but Henry Ford won't make a penny's investment.\" Henry Ford did run, however, and came within 7,000 votes of winning, out of more than 400,000 cast statewide. Henry Ford was defeated in a close election by the Republican candidate, Truman Newberry, a former the U.S. Secretary of the Navy. Henry Ford remained a staunch Wilsonian and supporter of the League of Nations. When President Woodrow Wilson made a major speaking tour in the summer of 1919 to promote the League of Nations, Henry Ford helped fund the attendant publicity.Henry Ford opposed the U.S.'s entry into [0] and continued to believe that international business could generate the prosperity that would head off wars. Henry Ford \"insisted [0] was the product of greedy financiers who sought profit in human destruction\". In 1939, Henry Ford went so far as to claim that the torpedoing of U.S. merchant ships by German submarines was the result of conspiratorial activities undertaken by financier war-makers. The financiers to whom Henry Ford was referring was Henry Ford's code for Jews; Henry Ford had also accused Jews of fomenting the First World War.In the run-up to [0] and when [0] erupted in 1939, Henry Ford reported that Henry Ford did not want to trade with belligerents. Like many other businessmen of the Great Depression era, Henry Ford never liked or entirely trusted the Franklin Roosevelt Administration, and thought Franklin Roosevelt was inching the U.S. closer to war. Henry Ford continued to do business with Nazi Germany, including the manufacture of war materiel. However, Henry Ford also agreed to build warplane engines for Nazi Germany. In early 1940, Henry Ford boasted that His company would soon be able to produce 1,000 U.S. warplanes a day, even though His company did not have an aircraft production facility at that time.:\u200a430\u200a Ford was a prominent early member of the America First Committee against World War II involvement, but was forced to resign from the America First Committee against World War II involvement's executive board when Henry Ford's involvement proved too controversial.Beginning in 1940, with the requisitioning of between 100 and 200 French POWs to work as slave laborers, His company contravened Article 31 of the 1929 Geneva Convention.When Rolls-Royce sought a U.S. manufacturer as an additional source for the Merlin engine (as fitted to Spitfire and Hurricane fighters), Henry Ford first agreed to do so and then reneged. Henry Ford \"lined up behind the war effort\" when the U.S. entered in December 1941.Before the U.S. entered [0], responding to Franklin Roosevelt's call in December 1940 for the \"Great Arsenal of Democracy\", Henry Ford directed His company to construct a vast new purpose-built aircraft factory at Willow Run near Detroit, Michigan. His company broke ground on Willow Run near Detroit, Michigan in the spring of 1941, B-24 component production began in May 1942, and the first complete B-24 came off the line in October 1942. At 3,500,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (330,000\u00a0m2), a vast new purpose-built aircraft factory was the largest assembly line in the world at the time. At a vast new purpose-built aircraft factory's peak in 1944, a vast new purpose-built aircraft factory produced 650 B-24s per month, and by 1945 Ford was completing each B-24 in eighteen hours, with one rolling off a vast new purpose-built aircraft factory every 58 minutes. Ford produced 9,000 B-24s at Willow Run near Detroit, Michigan, half of the 18,000 total B-24s produced during [0].:\u200a430\u200aWhen Edsel Ford died of cancer in 1943, aged only 49, Henry Ford nominally resumed control of Ford, but a series of strokes in the late 1930s had left Henry Ford increasingly debilitated, and Henry Ford's mental ability was fading. Henry Ford was increasingly sidelined, and others made decisions in Henry Ford's name. Ford was controlled by a handful of senior executives led by Charles Sorensen, an important engineer and production executive at Ford; and Harry Bennett, the chief of Ford's Service Unit, Ford's paramilitary force that spied on, and enforced discipline upon, Ford employees. Henry Ford grew jealous of the publicity Charles Sorensen, an important engineer and production executive at Ford received and forced Charles Sorensen, an important engineer and production executive at Ford out in 1944. Henry Ford's incompetence led to discussions in Washington about how to restore Ford, whether by wartime government fiat, or by instigating a coup among executives and directors.Nothing happened until 1945 when, with bankruptcy a serious risk, Ford's wife Clara and Edsel's widow Eleanor confronted Henry Ford and demanded Henry Ford cede control of Ford to his grandson Henry Ford II. Ford's wife Clara and Edsel's widow Eleanor threatened to sell off Ford's wife Clara and Edsel's widow Eleanor's stock, which amounted to three quarters of Ford's total shares, if Henry Ford refused. Henry Ford was reportedly infuriated, but had no choice but to give in.[better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] his grandson Henry Ford II took over and, as his grandson Henry Ford II's first act of business, fired Harry Bennett, the chief of Ford's Service Unit, Ford's paramilitary force that spied on, and enforced discipline upon, Ford employees."}, "Antisemitism and The Dearborn Independent": {"": "[0]  is our person to focus on.

A year and a half later, [0] began publishing a series of articles in his hometown newspaper, The Dearborn Independent under [0]'s own name, claiming a vast Jewish conspiracy was affecting America.  a series of articles ran in 91 issues.  Every Ford dealership nationwide was required to carry his hometown newspaper, The Dearborn Independent and distribute his hometown newspaper, The Dearborn Independent to Every Ford dealership nationwide's customers.  [0] later bound a series of articles into four volumes entitled The International Jew: The World's Foremost Problem, which was translated into multiple languages and distributed widely across America and Europe. The International Jew: The World's Foremost Problem blamed nearly all the troubles The International Jew: The World's Foremost Problem saw in American society on Jews.  his hometown newspaper, The Dearborn Independent ran for eight years, from 1920 until 1927.  With around 700,000 readers of his hometown newspaper, The Dearborn Independent, [0] emerged as a \"spokesman for right-wing extremism and religious prejudice.\"In Germany, The International Jew: The World's Foremost Problem was published by Theodor Fritsch, founder of several antisemitic parties and a member of the Reichstag. In a letter written in 1924, Heinrich Himmler described [0] as \"one of our most valuable, important, and witty fighters\".

Steven Watts wrote that Hitler's \"revered\" [0], proclaiming that \"Hitler's shall do Hitler's's best to put his theories into practice in Germany\", and modeling the Volkswagen Beetle, the people's car, on the Model T. Max Wallace has stated, \"History records that ... Hitler's was an ardent Anti-Semite before Hitler's ever read The International Jew: The World's Foremost Problem.\" [0] also paid to print and distribute 500,000 copies of the antisemitic fabricated text The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.  Historians say Hitler's distributed [0]'s books and articles throughout Germany, stoking the hatred that helped fuel the Holocaust.On February 1, 1924, [0] received Kurt Ludecke, a representative of Hitler, at home. Kurt Ludecke, a representative of Hitler was introduced to [0] by Siegfried Wagner (son of the composer Richard Wagner) and Siegfried Wagner (son of the composer Richard Wagner)'s wife Winifred, both Nazi sympathizers and antisemites. Kurt Ludecke, a representative of Hitler asked [0] for a contribution to the Nazi cause, but was apparently refused.Ford's articles were denounced by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL). While Ford's articles explicitly condemned pogroms and violence against Jews, Ford's articles blamed the Jews themselves the Jews themselves for provoking pogroms and violence against Jews.

Friends and business associates said Friends and business associates warned [0] about the contents of the Independent his hometown newspaper, The Dearborn Independent and that [0] probably never read Ford's articles ([0] claimed [0] only read the headlines). On the other hand, court testimony in a libel suit, brought by one of the targets of the newspaper, alleged that [0] did know about the contents of the Independent his hometown newspaper, The Dearborn Independent in advance of publication.a libel suit, brought by one of the targets of the newspaper, was brought by San Francisco lawyer and Jewish farm cooperative organizer Aaron Sapiro in response to the antisemitic remarks, and led [0] to close his hometown newspaper, The Dearborn Independent in December 1927. News reports at the time quoted [0] as saying [0] was shocked by the content and unaware of the content's nature.

Mrs. Stanley Ruddiman, a Ford family intimate, remarked that \"Mrs. Stanley Ruddiman, a Ford family intimate, don't think the editor of Ford's \"Own Page\", William Cameron, ever wrote anything for publication without [0]'s approval.\" According to Spencer Blakeslee, \"the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) mobilized prominent Jews and non-Jews to publicly oppose [0]'s message. prominent Jews and non-Jews formed a coalition of Jewish groups for the same purpose and raised constant objections in the Detroit press. Before leaving his's presidency early in 1921, his joined other leading Americans in a statement that rebuked Ford and others for Ford and others's antisemitic campaign. A boycott against [0] products by Jews and liberal Christians also had an impact, and [0] shut down his hometown newspaper, The Dearborn Independent in 1927, recanting his theories in a public letter to Sigmund Livingston, president of the ADLthe Anti-Defamation League (ADL).\" Wallace also found that Ford's apology was likely, or at least partly, motivated by a business that was slumping as a result of [0]'s antisemitism, repelling potential buyers of [0] cars. Up until Ford's apology, a considerable number of dealers, who had been required to make sure that buyers of [0] cars received his hometown newspaper, The Dearborn Independent, bought up and destroyed copies of his hometown newspaper, The Dearborn Independent rather than alienate customers.Ford's apology was well received. \"Four-fifths of the hundreds of letters addressed to Ford in July 1927 were from Jews, and almost without exception the hundreds of letters addressed to Ford in July 1927 praised [0]...\" In January 1937, a [0] statement to The Detroit Jewish Chronicle disavowed \"any connection whatsoever with the publication in Germany of a book known as the International Jew\". [0], however, allegedly never signed the retraction and apology, which were written by others\u2014rather, [0]'s signature was forged by Harry Bennett\u2014and [0] never actually recanted his theories, stating in 1940: \"[0] hope to republish The International Jew: The World's Foremost Problem again some time.\"In July 1938, the German consul in Cleveland gave [0], on [0]'s 75th birthday, the award of the Grand Cross of the German Eagle, the highest medal Nazi Germany could bestow on a foreigner.
