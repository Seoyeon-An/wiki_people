{"summary": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] (/ke\u026anz/ KAYNZ; 5 June 1883 \u2013 21 April 1946) was an English economist and philosopher whose ideas fundamentally changed the theory and practice of macroeconomics and the economic policies of governments. Originally trained in mathematics, [0] built on and greatly refined earlier work on the causes of business cycles. [0]the 20th century, [0] produced writings that are the basis for the school of thought known as Keynesian economics, and the school of thought known as Keynesian economics's various offshoots. [0]'s ideas, reformulated as New Keynesianism, are fundamental to mainstream macroeconomics. [0] is known as the \"father of macroeconomics\".During the Great Depression of the 1930s, [0] spearheaded a revolution in economic thinking, challenging the ideas of neoclassical economics that held that free markets would, in the short to medium term, automatically provide full employment, as long as workers were flexible in workers's wage demands. [0] argued that aggregate demand (total spending in the economy) determined the overall level of economic activity, and that inadequate aggregate demand could lead to prolonged periods of high unemployment, and since wages and labour costs are rigid downwards the economy will not automatically rebound to full employment. [0] advocated the use of fiscal and monetary policies to mitigate the adverse effects of economic recessions and depressions. [0] detailed these ideas in [0]'s magnum opus, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, published in late 1936. By the late 1930s, leading Western economies had begun adopting [0]'s policy recommendations. Almost all capitalist governments had done so by the end of the two decades following [0]'s death in 1946. As a leader of the British delegation, [0] participated in the design of the international economic institutions established after the end of World War II but was overruled by the American delegation on several aspects.[0]'s influence started to wane in the 1970s, partly as a result of the stagflation that plagued the Anglo-American economies during the 1970s, and partly because of criticism of Keynesian policies by Milton Friedman and other monetarists, who disputed the ability of government to favourably regulate the business cycle with fiscal policy. The advent of the global financial crisis of 2007\u20132008 sparked a resurgence in Keynesian thought. Keynesian economics provided the theoretical underpinning for economic policies undertaken in response to the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008 by President Barack Obama of the United States, Prime Minister Gordon Brown of the United Kingdom, and other heads of governments.When Time magazine included [0] among Time magazine's Most Important People of the 20th century in 1999, Time magazine reported that \"[0]'s radical idea that governments should spend money governments don't have may have saved capitalism\". The Economist has described [0] as \"Britain's most famous 20th-century economist\". In addition to being an economist, [0] was also a civil servant, a director of the Bank of England, and a part of the Bloomsbury Group of intellectuals."}, "Early life and education": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was born in Cambridge, England, in June 1883 to an upper-middle-class family. His father, John Neville Keynes, was an economist and a lecturer in moral sciences at the University of Cambridge and his mother, Florence Ada Keynes, a local social reformer. [0] was the first born, and was followed by two more children\u00a0\u2013 Margaret Neville Keynes in 1885 and Geoffrey Keynes in 1887. Geoffrey Keynes became a surgeon and Margaret Neville Keynes married the Nobel Prize-winning physiologist Archibald Hill.According to the economic historian and biographer Robert Skidelsky, Keynes's parents were loving and attentive. Keynes's parents attended a Congregational Church and remained in the same house throughout Keynes's parents's lives, where [0] were always welcome to return. [0] received considerable support from His father, John Neville Keynes,, including expert coaching to help [0] pass [0]'s scholarship exams and financial help both as a young man and when [0]'s assets were nearly wiped out at the onset of Great Depression in 1929. his mother, Florence Ada Keynes, a local social reformer made his mother, Florence Ada Keynes, a local social reformer's interests his mother, Florence Ada Keynes, a local social reformer's own, and according to the economic historian and biographer Robert Skidelsky, \"because his mother, Florence Ada Keynes, a local social reformer could grow up with his mother, Florence Ada Keynes, a local social reformer's , [0] never outgrew home\".In January 1889, at the age of five and a half, [0] started at the kindergarten of the Perse School for Girls for five mornings a week. [0] quickly showed a talent for arithmetic, but [0]'s health was poor leading to several long absences. [0] was tutored at home by a governess, Beatrice Mackintosh, and his mother, Florence Ada Keynes, a local social reformer. In January 1892, at eight and a half, [0] started as a day pupil at St Faith's preparatory school. By 1894, [0] was top of [0]'s class and excelling at mathematics. In 1896, St Faith's preparatory school's headmaster, Ralph Goodchild, wrote that [0] was \"head and shoulders above all the other boys in St Faith's preparatory school\" and was confident that [0] could get a scholarship to Eton.In 1897, [0] won a King's Scholarship to Eton[0] : in 1901, [0] was awarded the Tomline Prize for mathematics. At Eton, [0] experienced the first \"love of [0]'s life\" in Dan Macmillan, older brother of the future Prime Minister Harold Macmillan. Despite [0]'s middle-class background, [0] mixed easily with upper-class pupils.In 1902, [0] left Eton for King's College, Cambridge, after receiving a scholarship for this also, to read mathematics. Alfred Marshall begged [0] to become an economist, although [0]'s own inclinations drew [0] towards philosophy, especially the ethical system of G. E. Moore. [0] was elected to the University Pitt Club and was an active member of the semi-secretive Cambridge Apostles society, a debating club largely reserved for the brightest students. Like many members, [0] retained a bond to the semi-secretive Cambridge Apostles society, a debating club largely reserved for the brightest students after graduating and continued to attend occasional meetings throughout [0]'s life. Before leaving Cambridge, England,, [0] became the president of the Cambridge Union Society and Cambridge University Liberal Club. [0] was said to be an atheist.In May 1904, [0] received a first-class BA in mathematics. Aside from a few months spent on holidays with family and friends, [0] continued to involve [0] with King's College, Cambridge over the next two years. [0] took part in debates, further studied philosophy and attended economics lectures informally as a graduate student for one term, which constituted [0]'s only formal education in economics. [0] took civil service exams in 1906.The economist Harry Johnson wrote that the optimism imparted by [0]'s early life is a key to understanding [0]'s later thinking.[0] was always confident [0] could find a solution to whatever problem [0] turned [0]'s attention to and retained a lasting faith in the ability of government officials to do good.[0]'s optimism was also cultural, in two senses: [0] was of the last generation raised by an empire still at the height of its power an empire still at the height of its power's and was also of the last generation who felt entitled to govern by culture, rather than by expertise. According to the economic historian and biographer Robert Skidelsky, the sense of cultural unity current in Britain from the 19th century to the end of World War I provided a framework with which the well-educated could set various spheres of knowledge in relation to each other and life, enabling the well-educated to confidently draw from different fields when addressing practical problems."}, "Career": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. In October 1906 [0] began [0]'s Civil Service career as a clerk in the India Office. [0] enjoyed [0]'s work at first, but by 1908 had become bored and resigned [0]'s position to return to Cambridge and work on probability theory, through a lectureship in economics at first funded personally by economists Alfred Marshall and Arthur Pigou; [0] became a fellow of King's College in 1909.By 1909 [0] had also published [0]'s first professional economics article in The Economic Journal, about the effect of a recent global economic downturn on India. [0] founded the Political Economy Club, a weekly discussion group. [0]'s earnings rose further as [0] began to take on pupils for private tuition.In 1911 [0] was made the editor of The Economic Journal. By 1913 [0] had published his first book, Indian Currency and Finance. [0] was then appointed to the Royal Commission on Indian Currency and Finance\u00a0\u2013 the same topic as his first book, Indian Currency and Finance\u2013 where [0] showed considerable talent at applying economic theory to practical problems. [0]'s written work was published under the name \"J M Keynes\", though to [0]'s family and friends [0] was known as Maynard. (His father, John Neville Keynes, was also always known by His father, John Neville Keynes,'s middle name).", "First World War": "[0] is our person to focus on. The British Government called on [0]'s expertise during the First World War. While [0] did not formally re-join the civil service in 1914, [0] travelled to London at The British Government's request a few days before hostilities started. Bankers had been pushing for the suspension of specie payments\u00a0\u2013 the gold equivalent of banknotes\u00a0\u2013 but with [0]'s help the Chancellor of the Exchequer (then Lloyd George) was persuaded that the suspension of specie payments\u00a0\u2013 the gold equivalent of banknotes would be a bad idea, as it would hurt the future reputation of London if payments were suspended before payments was necessary.In January 1915 [0] took up an official government position at the Treasury. Among [0]'s responsibilities were the design of terms of credit between Britain and Britain's continental allies during the First World War and the acquisition of scarce currencies. According to economist Robert Lekachman, [0]'s \"nerve and mastery became legendary\" because of [0]'s performance of these duties, as in the case where [0] managed to assemble\u00a0\u2013 with difficulty\u00a0\u2013 a small supply of Spanish pesetas.The secretary of the Treasury was delighted to hear [0] had amassed enough to provide a temporary solution for The British Government. But [0] did not hand Spanish pesetas over, choosing instead to sell Spanish pesetas to break the market: [0]'s boldness paid off, as pesetas then became much less scarce and expensive.On the introduction of military conscription in 1916, [0] applied for exemption as a conscientious objector, which was effectively granted conditional upon continuing [0]'s government work.In the 1917 King's Birthday Honours, [0] was appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath for [0]'s wartime work, and [0]'s success led to the appointment that had a huge effect on [0]'s life and career; [0] was appointed financial representative for the Treasury to the 1919 Versailles peace conference. [0] was also appointed Officer of the Belgian Order of Leopold.", "Versailles peace conference": "[0] is our person to focus on. Keynes's experience at Versailles was influential in shaping [0]'s future outlook, yet Keynes's experience at Versailles was not a successful one. [0]'s main interest had been in trying to prevent Germany's's compensation payments being set so high it would traumatise innocent German people, damage Germany's's ability to pay and sharply limit Germany's's ability to buy exports from other countries\u00a0\u2013 thus hurting not just Germany's's economy but that of the wider world.Unfortunately for [0], conservative powers in the coalition that emerged from the 1918 coupon election were able to ensure that both Keynes himself and the Treasury were largely excluded from formal high-level talks concerning reparations. both Keynes himself and the Treasury's place was taken by the Heavenly Twins\u00a0\u2013 the judge Lord Sumner and the banker Lord Cunliffe, whose nickname derived from the \"astronomically\" high war compensation both Keynes himself and the Treasury wanted to demand from Germany's. [0] was forced to try to exert influence mostly from behind the scenes.The three principal players at Versailles were Britain's Lloyd George, France's Clemenceau and America's President Wilson.It was Britain's Lloyd George to whom [0] had much direct access; until the 1918 election Britain's Lloyd George had some sympathy with [0]'s view but while campaigning had found Britain's Lloyd George's speeches were well received by the public only if Britain's Lloyd George promised to harshly punish Germany's, and had therefore committed Britain's Lloyd George's delegation to extracting high payments.Britain's Lloyd George did, however, win some loyalty from [0] with Britain's Lloyd George's actions at the Paris conference by intervening against the French to ensure the dispatch of much-needed food supplies to German civilians. France's Clemenceau also pushed for substantial reparations, though not as high as those proposed by the British, while on security grounds, France's argued for an even more severe settlement than Britain's.America's President Wilson initially favoured relatively lenient treatment of Germany's\u00a0\u2013 America's President Wilson feared too harsh conditions could foment the rise of extremism and wanted Germany's to be left sufficient capital to pay for imports. To [0]'s dismay, Britain's Lloyd George and France's Clemenceau were able to pressure America's President Wilson to agree to include pensions in the reparations bill.Towards the end of the Paris conference, [0] came up with a plan that he argued would not only help Germany and other impoverished central European powers but also be good for the world economy as a whole. a plan that he argued would not only help Germany and other impoverished central European powers but also be good for the world economy as a whole involved the radical writing down of war debts, which would have had the possible effect of increasing international trade all round, but at the same time thrown over two-thirds of the cost of European reconstruction on America's.Britain's Lloyd George agreed a plan that he argued would not only help Germany and other impoverished central European powers but also be good for the world economy as a whole might be acceptable to the British electorate. However, America's was against a plan that he argued would not only help Germany and other impoverished central European powers but also be good for the world economy as a whole; America's was then the largest creditor, and by this time America's President Wilson had started to believe in the merits of a harsh peace and thought that America's President Wilson's had already made excessive sacrifices. Hence despite [0]'s best efforts, the result of the Paris conference was a treaty which disgusted [0] both on moral and economic grounds and led to [0]'s resignation from the Treasury.In June 1919 [0] turned down an offer to become chairman of the British Bank of Northern Commerce, a job that promised a salary of \u00a32,000 in return for a morning per week of work.[0]'s analysis on the predicted damaging effects of the treaty appeared in the highly influential book, The Economic Consequences of the Peace, published in 1919. the highly influential book, The Economic Consequences of the Peace, published in 1919 has been described as [0]'s best book, where [0] was able to bring all [0]'s gifts to bear\u00a0\u2013 [0]'s passion as well as [0]'s skill as an economist. In addition to economic analysis, the highly influential book, The Economic Consequences of the Peace, published in 1919 contained appeals to the reader's sense of compassion:[0] cannot leave this subject as though this subject's just treatment wholly depended either on our pledges or on economic facts. The policy of reducing Germany to servitude for a generation, of degrading the lives of millions of human beings, and of depriving a whole nation of happiness should be abhorrent and detestable, \u2013 abhorrent and detestable, even if The policy of reducing Germany to servitude for a generation, of degrading the lives of millions of human beings, and of depriving a whole nation of happiness was possible, even if The policy of reducing Germany to servitude for a generation, of degrading the lives of millions of human beings, and of depriving a whole nation of happiness enriched ourselves, even if The policy of reducing Germany to servitude for a generation, of degrading the lives of millions of human beings, and of depriving a whole nation of happiness did not sow the decay of the whole civilized life of Europe. Also present was striking imagery such as \"year by year Germany's must be kept impoverished and Germany's's children starved and crippled\" along with bold predictions which were later justified by events:If we aim deliberately at the impoverishment of Central Europe, vengeance, [0] dare predict, will not limp. Nothing can then delay for very long that final war between the forces of Reaction and the despairing convulsions of Revolution, before which the horrors of the late German war will fade into nothing. [0]'s followers assert that [0]'s predictions of disaster were borne out when the German economy suffered the hyperinflation of 1923, and again by the collapse of the Weimar Republic and the outbreak of the Second World War. However, historian Ruth Henig claims that \"most historians of the Paris conference now take the view that, in economic terms, the treaty was not unduly harsh on Germany's and that, while obligations and damages were inevitably much stressed in the debates at Paris to satisfy electors reading the daily newspapers, the intention was quietly to give Germany's substantial help towards paying Germany's's bills, and to meet many of the German objections by amendments to the way the reparations schedule was in practice carried out\".Only a small fraction of reparations was ever paid. In fact, historian Stephen A. Schuker demonstrates in American 'Reparations' to Germany's, 1919\u201333, that the capital inflow from American loans substantially exceeded German out payments so that, on a net basis, Germany's received support equal to four times the amount of the post-Second World War Marshall Plan.historian Stephen A. Schuker also shows that, in the years after Versailles, [0] became an informal reparations adviser to Germany's, wrote one of the major German reparation notes, and supported the hyperinflation of 1923 on political grounds. Nevertheless, The Economic Consequences of the Peace gained [0] international fame, even though the Peace also caused [0] to be regarded as anti-establishment\u00a0\u2013 it was not until after the outbreak of the Second World War that [0] was offered a directorship of a major British Bank, or an acceptable offer to return to government with a formal job. However, [0] was still able to influence government policy making through [0]'s network of contacts, [0]'s published works and by serving on government committees; this included attending high-level policy meetings as a consultant.", "In the 1920s": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] had completed his A Treatise on Probability before the war but published his A Treatise on Probability in 1921. his A Treatise on Probability was a notable contribution to the philosophical and mathematical underpinnings of probability theory, championing the important view that probabilities were no more or less than truth values intermediate between simple truth and falsity. [0] developed the first upper-lower probabilistic interval approach to probability in chapters 15 and 17 of his A Treatise on Probability, as well as having developed the first decision weight approach with [0]'s conventional coefficient of risk and weight, c, in chapter 26. In addition to [0]'s academic work, the 1920s saw [0] active as a journalist selling [0]'s work internationally and working in London as a financial consultant. In 1924 [0] wrote an obituary for his former tutor Alfred Marshall which Joseph Schumpeter called \"the most brilliant life of a man of science Joseph Schumpeter have ever read\". his former tutor Alfred Marshall was \"entranced\" by the memorial, while Lytton Strachey rated the memorial as one of [0]'s \"best works\".In 1922 [0] continued to advocate reduction of German reparations with A Revision of the Treaty. [0] attacked the post-the war deflation policies with A Tract on Monetary Reform in 1923\u00a0\u2013 a trenchant argument that countries should target stability of domestic prices, avoiding deflation even at the cost of allowing countries's currency to depreciate. Britain suffered from high unemployment through most of the 1920s, leading [0] to recommend the depreciation of sterling to boost jobs by making British exports more affordable. From 1924 [0] was also advocating a fiscal response, where the government could create jobs by spending on public works. During the 1920s [0]'s pro stimulus views had only limited effect on policy makers and mainstream academic opinion\u00a0\u2013 according to Hyman Minsky one reason was that at this time [0]'s theoretical justification was \"muddled\". A Tract on Monetary Reform had also called for an end to the gold standard. [0] advised it was no longer a net benefit for countries such as Britain to participate in the gold standard, as the gold standard ran counter to the need for domestic policy autonomy. the gold standard could force countries to pursue deflationary policies at exactly the time when expansionary measures were called for to address rising unemployment. The Treasury and Bank of England were still in favour of the gold standard and in 1925 The Treasury and Bank of England were able to convince the then Chancellor Winston Churchill to re-establish the gold standard, which had a depressing effect on British industry. [0] responded by writing The Economic Consequences of the then Chancellor Winston Churchill and continued to argue against the gold standard until Britain finally abandoned the gold standard in 1931.", "During the Great Depression": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] had begun a theoretical work to examine the relationship between unemployment, money and prices back in the 1920s. a theoretical work to examine the relationship between unemployment, money and prices was published in 1930 in two volumes. A central idea of a theoretical work to examine the relationship between unemployment, money and prices was that if the amount of money being saved exceeds the amount being invested\u00a0\u2013 which can happen if interest rates are too high\u00a0\u2013 then unemployment will rise. rise is in part a result of people not wanting to spend too high a proportion of what employers pay out, making it difficult, in aggregate, for employers to make a profit. Another key theme of a theoretical work to examine the relationship between unemployment, money and prices is the unreliability of financial indices for representing an accurate\u00a0\u2013 or indeed meaningful\u00a0\u2013 indication of general shifts in purchasing power of currencies over time. In particular, [0] criticised the justification of Britain's's return to the gold standard in 1925 at pre-war valuation by reference to the wholesale price index. [0] argued that the wholesale price index understated the effects of changes in the costs of services and labour.[0] was deeply critical of the British government's's austerity measures during the Great Depression. [0] believed that budget deficits during recessions were a good thing and a natural product of an economic slump. [0] wrote, \"For Government borrowing of one kind or another is nature's remedy, so to speak, for preventing business losses from being, in so severe a slump as the present one, so great as to bring production altogether to a standstill.\"At the height of the Great Depression, in 1933, [0] published The Means to Prosperity, which contained specific policy recommendations for tackling unemployment in a global recession, chiefly counter-cyclical public spending. The Means to Prosperity, which contained specific policy recommendations for tackling unemployment in a global recession, chiefly counter-cyclical public spending contains one of the first mentions of the multiplier effect. While The Means to Prosperity, which contained specific policy recommendations for tackling unemployment in a global recession, chiefly counter-cyclical public spending was addressed chiefly to the British government's, The Means to Prosperity, which contained specific policy recommendations for tackling unemployment in a global recession, chiefly counter-cyclical public spending also contained advice for other nations affected by the global recession. A copy was sent to the newly elected President Franklin D. Roosevelt and other world leaders. The Means to Prosperity, which contained specific policy recommendations for tackling unemployment in a global recession, chiefly counter-cyclical public spending was taken seriously by both the American and British governments, and according to Robert Skidelsky, helped pave the way for the later acceptance of Keynesian ideas, though The Means to Prosperity, which contained specific policy recommendations for tackling unemployment in a global recession, chiefly counter-cyclical public spending had little immediate practical influence. In the 1933 London Economic Conference opinions remained too diverse for a unified course of action to be agreed upon.Keynesian-like policies were adopted by Sweden and Germany, but Sweden was seen as too small to command much attention, and [0] was deliberately silent about the successful efforts of Germany as [0] was dismayed by Germany's imperialist ambitions and Germany's treatment of Jews. Apart from Britain's, [0]'s attention was primarily focused on the United States. In 1931, [0] received considerable support for [0]'s views on counter-cyclical public spending in Chicago, then the United States's foremost center for economic views alternative to the mainstream. However, orthodox economic opinion remained generally hostile regarding fiscal intervention to mitigate the Great Depression, until just before the outbreak of war. In late 1933 [0] was persuaded by Felix Frankfurter to address the newly elected President Franklin D. Roosevelt directly, which [0] did by letters and face to face in 1934, after which the two men spoke highly of the two men. However, according to Robert Skidelsky, the consensus is that [0]'s efforts began to have a more than marginal influence on US economic policy only after 1939.Keynes's magnum opus, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money was published in 1936. 1939.Keynes's magnum opus, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money was researched and indexed by one of [0]'s favourite students, and later economist, David Bensusan-Butt. 1939.Keynes's magnum opus, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money served as a theoretical justification for the interventionist policies [0] favoured for tackling a recession. Although [0] stated in [0]'s preface that 1939.Keynes's magnum opus, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money was only secondarily concerned with the \"applications of 1939.Keynes's magnum opus, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money to practice,\" the circumstances of 1939.Keynes's magnum opus, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money's publication were such that [0]'s suggestions shaped the course of the 1930s. In addition, [0] introduced the world to a new interpretation of taxation: since the legal tender is now defined by the state, inflation becomes \"taxation by currency depreciation\". a new interpretation of taxation meant a) that the standard of value should be governed by deliberate decision; and (b) that it was possible to maintain a middle course between deflation and inflation. a new interpretation of taxation was inspired by the desperate search for control over the economy which permeated the academic world after the Great Depression. 1939.Keynes's magnum opus, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money challenged the earlier neoclassical economic paradigm, which had held that provided it was unfettered by government interference, it would naturally establish full employment equilibrium. In doing so [0] was partly setting [0] against [0]'s former teachers Marshall and Pigou. [0] believed the classical theory was a \"special case\" that applied only to the particular conditions present in the 19th century, 1939.Keynes's magnum opus, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money being the general one. Classical economists had believed in Say's law, which, simply put, states that \"supply creates its demand\", and that in a free-market workers would always be willing to lower workers's wages to a level where employers could profitably offer workers jobs.An innovation from [0] was the concept of price stickiness\u00a0\u2013 the recognition that in reality workers often refuse to lower workers's wage demands even in cases where a classical economist might argue that it is rational for workers to do so. Due in part to price stickiness, it was established that the interaction of \"aggregate demand\" and \"aggregate supply\" may lead to stable unemployment equilibria\u00a0\u2013 and in those cases, it is on the state, not the market, that economies must depend for economies's salvation. In contrast, [0] argued that demand is what creates supply and not the other way around. [0] questioned Say's law, which, simply put, states that \"supply creates its demand\" by asking what would happen if the money that is being given to individuals is not finding the money that is being given to individuals's way back into the economy and is saved instead. [0] suggested the result would be a recession. To tackle the fear of a recession Say's law, which, simply put, states that \"supply creates its demand\" suggests government intervention. government intervention can be used to prevent any further increase in savings in the form of a decreased interest rate. Decreasing the interest rate will encourage people to start spending and investing again, or so it is stated by Say's law, which, simply put, states that \"supply creates its demand\". The reason behind encourage is that when there is little investing, savings start to accumulate and reach a stopping point in the flow of money. During the normal economic activity, it would be justified to have savings because savings can be given out as loans but in this case, there is little demand for savings, so savings are doing no good for the economy. The supply of savings then exceeds the demand for loans and the result is lower prices or lower interest rates. Thus, the idea is that the money that was once saved is now re-invested or spent, assuming lower interest rates appeal to consumers. To [0], however, appeal was not always the case, and it couldn't be assumed that lower interest rates would automatically encourage investment and spending again since there is no proven link between investment and spending.The General Theory argues that demand, not supply, is the key variable governing the overall level of economic activity. Aggregate demand, which equals total un-hoarded income in a society, is defined by the sum of consumption and investment. In a state of unemployment and unused production capacity, one can enhance employment and total income only by first increasing expenditures for either consumption or investment. Without government intervention to increase expenditure, an economy can remain trapped in a low-employment equilibrium. The demonstration of remain has been described as the revolutionary formal achievement of 1939.Keynes's magnum opus, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money.a theoretical work to examine the relationship between unemployment, money and prices advocated activist economic policy by government to stimulate demand in times of high unemployment, for example by spending on public works. \"Let us be up and doing, using our idle resources to increase our wealth,\" [0] wrote in 1928. \"With men and plants unemployed, it is ridiculous to say that we cannot afford these new developments. It is precisely with these plants and these men that we shall afford these new developments.\"The General Theory is often viewed as the foundation of modern macroeconomics. Few senior American economists agreed with [0] through most of the 1930s.Yet [0]'s were soon to achieve widespread acceptance, with eminent American professors such as Alvin Hansen agreeing with 1939.Keynes's magnum opus, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money before the outbreak of World War II.Keynes himself had only limited participation in the theoretical debates that followed the publication of 1939.Keynes's magnum opus, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money as [0] suffered a heart attack in 1937, requiring [0] to take long periods of rest. Among others, Hyman Minsky and Post-Keynesian economists have argued that as result, [0]'s were diluted by those keen to compromise with classical economists or to render [0]'s with mathematical models like the IS\u2013LM model (which, Hyman Minsky and Post-Keynesian economists argue, distort [0]'s ). [0] began to recover in 1939, but for the rest of [0]'s life [0]'s professional energies were directed largely towards the practical side of economics: the problems of ensuring optimum allocation of resources for the war efforts, post-war negotiations with the United States, and the new international financial order that was presented at the 1933 London Economic Conference.In 1939.Keynes's magnum opus, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money and later, [0] responded to the socialists who argued, especially during the Great Depression of the 1930s, that capitalism caused war. [0] argued that if capitalism were managed domestically and internationally (with coordinated international Keynesian policies, an international monetary system that did not pit the interests of countries against one another, and a high degree of freedom of trade), then this system of managed capitalism could promote peace rather than conflict between countries. [0]'s plans during World War II.Keynes himself for post-war international economic institutions and policies (which contributed to the creation at Bretton Woods of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and later to the creation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and eventually the World Trade Organization) were aimed to give effect to this vision.Although [0] has been widely criticised\u00a0\u2013 especially by members of the Chicago school of economics\u00a0\u2013 for advocating irresponsible government spending financed by borrowing, in fact [0] was a firm believer in balanced budgets and regarded the proposals for programmes of public works during the Great Depression as an exceptional measure to meet the needs of exceptional circumstances.", "Second World War": "[0] is our person to focus on. During the Second World War, [0] argued in How to Pay for the Second World War, published in 1940, that the Second World War should be largely financed by higher taxation and especially by compulsory saving (essentially workers lending money to the government), rather than deficit spending, to avoid inflation. Compulsory saving would act to dampen domestic demand, assist in channelling additional output towards the Second World War, would be fairer than punitive taxation and would have the advantage of helping to avoid a post-war slump by boosting demand once workers were allowed to withdraw workers's savings. In September 1941 [0] was proposed to fill a vacancy in the Court of Directors of the Bank of England, and subsequently carried out a full term from the following April. In June 1942, [0] was rewarded for [0]'s service with a hereditary peerage in the King's Birthday Honours. On 7 July [0]'s title was gazetted as \"Baron Keynes, of Tilton, in the County of Sussex\" and [0] took [0]'s seat in the House of Lords on the Liberal Party benches.By contrast, in [0]'s capacity as advisor on the Indian Financial and Monetary Affairs for the British Government, there is evidence that [0] advocated \"profit inflation\" in order to finance war spending by the Allied forces in Bengal. \"profit inflation\" contributed to the 1943 Bengal famine.As the Allied victory began to look certain, [0] was heavily involved, as leader of the British delegation and chairman of the World Bank commission, in the mid-1944 negotiations that established the Bretton Woods system. The [0] plan, concerning an international clearing-union, argued for a radical system for the management of currencies. [0] proposed the creation of a common world unit of currency, the bancor and new global institutions\u00a0\u2013 a world central bank and the International Clearing Union. [0] envisaged new global institutions\u00a0\u2013 a world central bank and the International Clearing Union managing an international trade and payments system with strong incentives for countries to avoid substantial trade deficits or surpluses. The USA's greater negotiating strength, however, meant that the outcomes accorded more closely to the more conservative plans of Harry Dexter White. According to US economist J. Bradford DeLong, on almost every point where [0] was overruled by the Americans, [0] was later proven correct by events.The new global institutions\u00a0\u2013 a world central bank and the International Clearing Union were founded as a compromise that primarily reflected the American vision. There would be no incentives for states to avoid a large trade surplus; instead, the burden for correcting a trade imbalance would continue to fall only on the deficit countries, which Keynes had argued were least able to address the problem without inflicting economic hardship on their populationsthe deficit countries, which Keynes had argued were least able to address the problem without inflicting economic hardship on their populations's . Yet, [0] was still pleased when accepting the final agreement, saying that if new global institutions\u00a0\u2013 a world central bank and the International Clearing Union stayed true to new global institutions\u00a0\u2013 a world central bank and the International Clearing Union's founding principles, \"the brotherhood of man will have become more than a phrase.\"", "Postwar": "[0] is our person to focus on. After the war, [0] continued to represent the United Kingdom in international negotiations despite [0]'s deteriorating health. [0] succeeded in obtaining preferential terms from the United States for new and outstanding debts to facilitate the rebuilding of the British economy.Just before [0]'s death in 1946, [0] told Henry Clay, a professor of social economics and advisor to the Bank of England, of [0]'s hopes that Adam Smith's \"invisible hand\" could help the United Kingdom out of the economic hole the United Kingdom was in: \"[0] find [0] more and more relying for a solution of the United Kingdom's problems on Adam Smith's \"invisible hand\".\""}, "Influence and legacy": {"Keynesian ascendancy 1939\u201379": "[0] is our person to focus on. From the end of the Great Depression to the mid-1970s, [0] provided the main inspiration for economic policymakers in Europe, America and much of the rest of the world. While economists and policymakers had become increasingly won over to [0]'s way of thinking in the mid and late 1930s, it was only after the outbreak of World War II that governments started to borrow money for spending on a scale sufficient to eliminate unemployment. According to the economist John Kenneth Galbraith (then a US government official charged with controlling inflation), in the rebound of the economy from wartime spending, \"one could not have had a better demonstration of the Keynesian ideas\".The Keynesian Revolution was associated with the rise of modern liberalism in the West during the post-war period. Keynesian ideas became so popular that some scholars point to [0] as representing the ideals of modern liberalism, as Adam Smith represented the ideals of classical liberalism. After World War II, Winston Churchill attempted to check the rise of Keynesian policy-making in America and used rhetoric critical of the mixed economy in Winston Churchill's 1945 election campaign. Despite Winston Churchill's popularity as a war hero, Winston Churchill suffered a landslide defeat to Clement Attlee, whose government's economic policy continued to be influenced by [0]'s ideas.In the late 1930s and 1940s, economists (notably John Hicks, Franco Modigliani and Paul Samuelson) attempted to interpret and formalise [0]'s writings in terms of formal mathematical models. In what had become known as the neoclassical synthesis, economists (notably John Hicks, Franco Modigliani and Paul Samuelson) combined Keynesian analysis with neoclassical economics to produce neo-Keynesian economics, which came to dominate mainstream macroeconomic thought for the next 40 years.By the 1950s, Keynesian policies were adopted by almost the entire developed world and similar measures for a mixed economy were used by many developing nations. By then, [0]'s views on the economy had become mainstream in the world's universities. Throughout the late 1930s and 1940s, the developed and emerging free capitalist economies enjoyed exceptionally high growth and low unemployment. Professor Gordon Fletcher has written that the late 1930s and 1940s, appear in retrospect as a golden age of capitalism.In late 1965 Time magazine ran a cover article with a title comment from Milton Friedman (later echoed by US President Richard Nixon), \"We are all Keynesians now\". a cover article with a title comment described the exceptionally favourable economic conditions then prevailing and reported that \"Washington's economic managers scaled these heights by Washington's economic managers's adherence to [0]'s central theme: the modern capitalist economy does not automatically work at top efficiency, but can be raised to top efficiency by the intervention and influence of the government.\" a cover article with a title comment also states that [0] was one of the three most important economists who ever lived, and that [0]'s General Theory was more influential than the magna opera of other famous economists, such as Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations.The concept of the multiplier was first developed by R. F. Kahn in R. F. Kahn's article \"The relation of home investment to unemployment\" in The Economic Journal of June 1931. The R. F. Kahn multiplier was the employment multiplier; [0] took the idea from R. F. Kahn and formulated the investment multiplier.", "Keynesian economics out of favour 1979\u20132007": "[0] is our person to focus on. Keynesian economics were officially discarded by the British Government in 1979, but forces had begun to gather against Keynes's ideas over 30 years earlier. Friedrich Hayek had formed the Mont Pelerin Society in 1947, with the explicit intention of nurturing intellectual currents to one day displace Keynesianism and other similar influences. the Mont Pelerin Society's members included the Austrian School economist Ludwig von Mises along with the then young Milton Friedman. Initially the Mont Pelerin Society had little impact on the wider world\u00a0\u2013 according to Friedrich Hayek it was as if [0] had been raised to sainthood after [0]'s death and that people refused to allow [0]'s work to be questioned.the then young Milton Friedman, however, began to emerge as a formidable critic of Keynesian economics from the mid-1950s, and especially after the then young Milton Friedman's 1963 publication of A Monetary History of the United States.On the practical side of economic life, \"big government\" had appeared to be firmly entrenched in the 1950s, but the balance began to shift towards the power of private interests in the 1960s. [0] had written against the folly of allowing \"decadent and selfish\" speculators and financiers the kind of influence \"decadent and selfish\" speculators and financiers had enjoyed after World War I. For two decades after World War I. public opinion was strongly against private speculators, the disparaging label \"Gnomes of Zurich\" being typical of how private speculators were described during this period. International speculation was severely restricted by the capital controls in place after Bretton Woods. According to the journalists Larry Elliott and Dan Atkinson, 1968 was the pivotal year when power shifted in favour of private agents such as currency speculators. As the key 1968 event the journalists Larry Elliott and Dan Atkinson picked out the United States's suspension of the conversion of the dollar into gold except on request of foreign governments, which the journalists Larry Elliott and Dan Atkinson identified as the beginning of the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system.Criticisms of Keynes's ideas had begun to gain significant acceptance by the early 1970s, as Criticisms of Keynes's ideas were then able to make a credible case that Keynesian models no longer reflected economic reality. [0] included few formulas and no explicit mathematical models in [0]'s General Theory. For economists such as Hyman Minsky, [0]'s limited use of mathematics was partly the result of [0]'s scepticism about whether phenomena as inherently uncertain as economic activity could ever be adequately captured by mathematical models. Nevertheless, many models were developed by Keynesian economists, with a famous example being the Phillips curve which predicted an inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation. the Phillips curve which predicted an inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation implied that unemployment could be reduced by government stimulus with a calculable cost to inflation. In 1968, the then young Milton Friedman published a paper arguing that the fixed relationship implied by the Phillips curve which predicted an inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation did not exist.the then young Milton Friedman suggested that sustained Keynesian policies could lead to both unemployment and inflation rising at once\u00a0\u2013 rising. In the early 1970s stagflation appeared in both the United States and Britain just as the then young Milton Friedman had predicted, with economic conditions deteriorating further after the 1973 oil crisis. Aided by the prestige gained from the then young Milton Friedman's successful forecast, the then young Milton Friedman led increasingly successful criticisms against the Keynesian consensus, convincing not only academics and politicians but also much of the general public with the then young Milton Friedman's radio and television broadcasts. The academic credibility of Keynesian economics was further undermined by additional criticism from other monetarists trained in the Chicago school of economics, by the Lucas critique and by criticisms from Friedrich Hayek's Austrian School. So successful were these criticisms that by 1980 Lucas claimed economists would often take offence if described as Keynesians.Keynesian principles fared increasingly poorly on the practical side of economics\u00a0\u2013 by 1979 Keynesian principles had been displaced by monetarism as the primary influence on Anglo-American economic policy. However, many officials on both sides of the Atlantic retained a preference for [0], and in 1984 the Federal Reserve officially discarded monetarism, after which Keynesian principles made a partial comeback as an influence on policy making.Not all academics accepted the criticism against [0]\u00a0\u2013 Hyman Minsky has argued that Keynesian economics had been debased by excessive mixing with neoclassical ideas from the 1950s, and that it was unfortunate that Keynesian economics had even continued to be called \"Keynesian\". Writing in The American Prospect, Robert Kuttner argued it was not so much excessive Keynesian activism that caused the economic problems of the 1970s but the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system of capital controls, which allowed capital flight from regulated economies into unregulated economies in a fashion similar to Gresham's law phenomenon (where weak currencies undermine strong ones).Historian Peter Pugh has stated that a key cause of the economic problems afflicting the United States in the 1970s was the refusal to raise taxes to finance the Vietnam War, which was against Keynesian advice.A more typical response was to accept some elements of the criticisms while refining Keynesian economic theories to defend Keynesian economic theories against arguments that would invalidate the whole Keynesian framework\u00a0\u2013 the resulting body of work largely composing New Keynesian economics. In 1992 Alan Blinder wrote about a \"Keynesian Restoration\", as work based on Keynes's ideas had to some extent become fashionable once again in academia, though in the mainstream work based on Keynes's ideas was highly synthesised with monetarism and other neoclassical thinking. In the world of policy making, free market influences broadly sympathetic to monetarism have remained very strong at government level\u00a0\u2013 in powerful normative institutions like the World Bank, the IMF and US Treasury, and in prominent opinion-forming media such as the Financial Times and The Economist.", "Keynesian resurgence 2008\u201309": "John Maynard Keynes is our person to focus on. The global financial crisis of 2007\u201308 led to public skepticism about the free market consensus even from some on the economic right. In [0], Martin Wolf, chief economics commentator at the Financial Times, announced the death of the dream of global free-market capitalism. In [0] macroeconomist James K. Galbraith used the 25th Annual Milton Friedman Distinguished Lecture to launch a sweeping attack against the free market consensus and argued that Keynesian economics were far more relevant for tackling the emerging crises.Economist Robert J. Shiller had begun advocating robust government intervention to tackle the emerging crises, specifically citing John Maynard Keynes. Nobel laureate Paul Krugman also actively argued the case for vigorous Keynesian intervention in the economy in Nobel laureate Paul Krugman's columns for The New York Times.Other prominent economic commentators who have argued for Keynesian government intervention to mitigate the emerging crises include George Akerlof, J. Bradford DeLong, Robert Reich and Joseph Stiglitz.Newspapers and other media have also cited work relating to John Maynard Keynes by Hyman Minsky, Robert Skidelsky, Donald Markwell and Axel Leijonhufvud.A series of major bailouts were pursued during the emerging crises, starting on 7 September with the announcement that the US Government was to nationalise the two government-sponsored enterprises which oversaw most of the US subprime mortgage market\u00a0\u2013 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In October, Alistair Darling, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, referred to John Maynard Keynes as Alistair Darling, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, announced plans for substantial fiscal stimulus to head off the worst effects of recession, in accordance with Keynesian economic thought. Similar policies have been adopted by other governments worldwide.adopted is in stark contrast to the action imposed on Indonesia during the Asian financial crisis of 1997, when Indonesia was forced by the IMF to close 16 banks at the same time, prompting a bank run.Much of the post-crisis discussion reflected John Maynard Keynes's advocacy of international coordination of fiscal or monetary stimulus, and of international economic institutions such as the IMF and the World Bank, which many had argued should be reformed as a \"new Bretton Woods\", and should have been even before the emerging crises broke out.The the IMF and United Nations economists advocated a coordinated international approach to fiscal stimulus. Donald Markwell argued that in the absence of such an international approach, there would be a risk of worsening international relations and possibly even world war arising from economic factors similar to those present during the depression of the 1930s.By the end of December 2008, the Financial Times reported that \"the sudden resurgence of Keynesian policy is a stunning reversal of the orthodoxy of the past several decades.\"In December 2008, Nobel laureate Paul Krugman released Nobel laureate Paul Krugman's book The Return of Depression Economics and the Crisis of 2008, arguing that economic conditions similar to those that existed during the earlier part of the 20th century had returned, making Keynesian policy prescriptions more relevant than ever. In February 2009 Robert J. Shiller and George Akerlof published Animal Spirits, a book where Robert J. Shiller and George Akerlof argue the current US stimulus package is too small as the current US stimulus package does not take into account John Maynard Keynes's insight on the importance of confidence and expectations in determining the future behaviour of businesspeople and other economic agents.In the March 2009 speech entitled Reform the International Monetary System, Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the People's Bank of China, came out in favour of John Maynard Keynes's idea of a centrally managed global reserve currency. Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the People's Bank of China argued that it was unfortunate that part of the reason for the Bretton Woods system breaking down was the failure to adopt John Maynard Keynes's bancor. Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the People's Bank of China proposed a gradual move towards increased use of the IMF special drawing rights (SDRs).Although Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the People's Bank of China's ideas had not been broadly accepted, leaders meeting in April at the 2009 G-20 London summit agreed to allow $250\u00a0billion of special drawing rights to be created by the IMF, to be distributed globally. Stimulus plans were credited for contributing to a better-than-expected economic outlook by both the OECDand the IMF, in reports published in June and July 2009. both the OECDand the IMF warned global leaders that recovery was likely to be slow, so counter recessionary measures ought not be rolled back too early.While the need for stimulus measures was broadly accepted among policy makers, there had been much debate over how to fund stimulus measures. Some leaders and institutions, such as Angela Merkeland the European Central Bank,expressed concern over the potential impact on inflation, national debt and the risk that a too large stimulus will create an unsustainable recovery.Among professional economists the revival of Keynesian economics has been even more divisive. Although many economists, such as George Akerlof, Nobel laureate Paul Krugman, Robert Shiller and Joseph Stiglitz, supported Keynesian stimulus, others did not believe higher government spending would help the economy recover from the Great Recession. Some economists, such as Robert Lucas, questioned the theoretical basis for stimulus packages. Others, like Robert Barro and Gary Becker, say that empirical evidence for beneficial effects from Keynesian stimulus does not exist. However, there is a growing academic literature that shows that fiscal expansion helps an economy grow in the near term, and that certain types of fiscal stimulus are particularly effective.", "New Keynesian economics": "John Maynard Keynes is our person to focus on. [0] developed in the 1990s and early 2000s as a response to the critique that macroeconomics lacked microeconomic foundations. [0] developed models to provide microfoundations for Keynesian economics. [0] incorporated parts of new classical macroeconomics to develop the new neoclassical synthesis, which forms the basis for mainstream macroeconomics today.Two main assumptions define the New Keynesian approach to macroeconomics. Like the New Classical approach, New Keynesian macroeconomic analysis usually assumes that households and firms have rational expectations. However, the two schools differ in that New Keynesian analysis usually assumes a variety of market failures. In particular, New Keynesians assume that there is imperfect competition in price and wage setting to help explain why prices and wages can become \"sticky\", which means prices and wages do not adjust instantaneously to changes in economic conditions.Wage and price stickiness, and the other market failures present in New Keynesian models, imply that the economy may fail to attain full employment. Therefore, New Keynesians argue that macroeconomic stabilisation by the government (using fiscal policy) and the central bank (using monetary policy) can lead to a more efficient macroeconomic outcome than a laissez faire policy would.", "": ""}, "Overall views": {"Praise": "[0] is our person to focus on.

Yet after [0]'s death, Austrian School economist Friedrich Hayek wrote: \"[0] was the one really great man Austrian School economist Friedrich Hayek ever knew, and for whom Austrian School economist Friedrich Hayek had unbounded admiration. The world will be a very much poorer place without [0].\" A colleague Nicholas Davenport recalled, \"There were deep emotional forces about [0] ... One could sense [0]'s humanity. There was nothing of the cold intellectual about [0].\"Lionel Robbins, former head of the economics department at the London School of Economics, who engaged in many heated debates with Keynes in the 1930s, had this to say after observing [0] in early negotiations with the Americans while drawing up plans for Bretton Woods:early negotiations with the Americans went very well indeed.

As a man of the centre described by some as having the greatest impact of any 20th-century economist, [0] attracted considerable criticism from both sides of the political spectrum. In the 1920s, [0] was seen as anti-establishment and was mainly attacked from the right. In the \"red 1930s\", many young economists favoured Marxist views, even in Cambridge, and while [0] was engaging principally with the right to try to persuade the right of the merits of more progressive policy, the most vociferous criticism against [0] came from the left, who saw [0] as a supporter of capitalism. From the 1950s and onwards, most of the attacks against [0] have again been from the right.In 1931, Friedrich Hayek extensively critiqued [0]'s 1930 Treatise on Money. After reading Hayek's The Road to Serfdom, [0] wrote to Friedrich Hayek: \"Morally and philosophically [0] find [0] in agreement with virtually the whole of Hayek's The Road to Serfdom.\" [0] concluded wrote with the recommendation:What we need therefore, in [0]'s opinion, is not a change in our economic programmes, which would only lead in practice to disillusion with the results of your philosophy; but perhaps even the contrary, namely, an enlargement of the results of your philosophy. Friedrich Hayek's greatest danger is the probable practical failure of the application of your philosophy in the United States. On the pressing issue of the time, whether deficit spending could lift a country from depression, [0] replied to Friedrich Hayek's criticism in the following way:[0] should... conclude rather differently. [0] should say that what we want is not no planning, or even less planning, indeed [0] should say we almost certainly want more. But the planning should take place in a community in which as many people as possible, both leaders and followers wholly share your moral position. Moderate planning will be safe enough if those carrying it out are rightly oriented in those carrying it out's minds and hearts to the moral issue. Asked why [0] expressed \"moral and philosophical\" agreement with Hayek's The Road to Serfdom, Friedrich Hayek stated:Because [0] believed that [0] was fundamentally still a classical English liberal and wasn't quite aware of how far [0] had moved away from a classical English liberal. [0]'s basic ideas were still those of individual freedom. [0] did not think systematically enough to see the conflicts. [0] was, in a sense, corrupted by political necessity. According to some observers,[who?] Friedrich Hayek felt that the post-World War II \"Keynesian orthodoxy\" gave too much power to the state, and that such policies would lead toward socialism.While Milton Friedman described The General Theory as \"a great book\", Milton Friedman argues that The General Theory's implicit separation of nominal from real magnitudes is neither possible nor desirable. Macroeconomic policy, Milton Friedman argues, can reliably influence only the nominal. Milton Friedman and other monetarists have consequently argued that Keynesian economics can result in stagflation, the combination of low growth and high inflation that developed economies suffered in the early 1970s. More to Milton Friedman's taste was the Tract on Monetary Reform (1923), which he regarded as Keynes's best work because of its focus on maintaining domestic price stabilitythe Tract on Monetary Reform (1923), which he regarded as Keynes's best work because of its focus on maintaining domestic price stability's .Joseph Schumpeter was an economist of the same age as [0] and one of [0]'s main rivals. Joseph Schumpeter was among the first reviewers to argue that The General Theory was not a general theory, but a special case. Joseph Schumpeter said The General Theory expressed \"the attitude of a decaying civilisation\". After [0]'s death Joseph Schumpeter wrote a brief biographical piece [0]\u00a0\u2013 on a personal level Joseph Schumpeter was very positive about [0], praising [0]'s pleasant nature, courtesy and kindness. Joseph Schumpeter assessed some of [0]'s biographical and editorial work as among the best Joseph Schumpeter'd ever seen. Yet Joseph Schumpeter remained critical about [0]'s economics, linking [0]'s childlessness to what Joseph Schumpeter saw as an essentially short-term view. Joseph Schumpeter considered [0] to have a kind of unconscious patriotism that caused [0] to fail to understand the problems of other nations. For Joseph Schumpeter, \"Practical Keynesianism is a seedling which cannot be transplanted into foreign soil: Practical Keynesianism dies there and becomes poisonous as Practical Keynesianism dies.\" Joseph Schumpeter \"admired and envied [0], but when [0] died in 1946, Joseph Schumpeter's obituary gave [0] this same off-key, perfunctory treatment Joseph Schumpeter would later give Adam Smith in the History of Economic Analysis, the \"discredit of not adding a single innovation to the techniques of economic analysis.\"President Harry S. Truman was sceptical of Keynesian theorising. He told Leon Keyserling, a Keynesian economist who chaired Truman's Council of Economic Advisers: \"Nobody can ever convince Leon Keyserling, a Keynesian economist who chaired Truman's Council of Economic Advisers that government can spend a dollar that government's not got.\"", "Views on race": "[0] is our person to focus on. Some critics have sought to show that [0] had sympathies towards Nazism, and a number of writers have described [0] as antisemitic. [0]'s private letters contain portraits and descriptions, some of which can be characterised as antisemitic, while others as philosemitic.Scholars have suggested that portraits and descriptions, some of which can be characterised as antisemitic, while others as philosemitic reflect clich\u00e9s current at the time that [0] accepted uncritically, rather than any racism. On several occasions [0] used [0]'s influence to help [0]'s Jewish friends, most notably when [0] successfully lobbied for Ludwig Wittgenstein to be allowed residency in the United Kingdom, explicitly to rescue Ludwig Wittgenstein from being deported to Nazi-occupied Austria. [0] was a supporter of Zionism, serving on committees supporting Zionism.Allegations that [0] was racist or had totalitarian beliefs have been rejected by Robert Skidelsky and other biographers. Professor Gordon Fletcher wrote that \"the suggestion of a link between [0] and any support of totalitarianism cannot be sustained\". Once the aggressive tendencies of the Nazis towards Jews and other minorities had become apparent, [0] made clear [0]'s loathing of Nazism. As a lifelong pacifist [0] had initially favoured peaceful containment of Nazi Germany, yet [0] began to advocate a forceful resolution while many conservatives were still arguing for appeasement. After the war started, [0] roundly criticised the Left for losing the Left's nerve to confront Adolf Hitler, saying:the Left the Left were the loudest in demanding that the Nazi aggression should be resisted at all costs. When it comes to a showdown, scarce four weeks have passed before the Left remember that the Left are pacifists and write defeatist letters to your columns, leaving the defence of freedom and civilisation to Colonel Blimp and the Old School Tie, for whom Three Cheers. ", "Views on inflation": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] has been characterised as being indifferent or even positive about mild inflation. [0] had expressed a preference for inflation over deflation, saying that if one has to choose between the two evils, it is \"better to disappoint the rentier\" than to inflict pain on working-class families. [0] was also aware of the dangers of inflation. In The Economic Consequences of the Peace, [0] wrote:  Lenin is said to have declared that the best way to destroy the Capitalist System was to debauch the currency. By a continuing process of inflation, governments can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth of governments's citizens. There is no subtler, no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency. a continuing process of inflation engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction, and does engages in a manner which not one man in a million is able to diagnose. ", "Views on free trade and protectionism": "[0] is our person to focus on. At the beginning of [0]'s career, [0] was an economist close to Alfred Marshall, deeply convinced of the benefits of free trade. From the crisis of 1929 onwards, noting the commitment of the British authorities to defend the gold parity of the pound sterling and the rigidity of nominal wages, [0] gradually adhered to protectionist measures.On 5 November 1929, when heard by the Macmillan Committee to bring the British economy out of the crisis, [0] indicated that the introduction of tariffs on imports would help to rebalance the trade balance. the Macmillan Committee to bring the British economy out of the crisis's report states in a section entitled \"import control and export aid\", that in an economy where there is not full employment, the introduction of tariffs can improve production and employment. Thus, the reduction of the trade deficit favours the country's's growth.In January 1930, in the Economic Advisory Council, [0] proposed the introduction of a system of protection to reduce imports. In the autumn of 1930, [0] proposed a uniform tariff of 10% on all imports and subsidies of the same rate for all exports. In the Treatise on Money, published in the autumn of 1930, [0] took up the idea of tariffs or other trade restrictions with the aim of reducing the volume of imports and rebalancing the balance of trade.On 7 March 1931, in the New Statesman and Nation, [0] wrote an article entitled Proposal for a Tariff Revenue. [0] pointed out that the reduction of wages led to a reduction in national demand which constrained markets. Instead, [0] proposed the idea of an expansionary policy combined with a tariff system to neutralise the effects on the balance of trade. The application of customs tariffs seemed to [0] \"unavoidable, whoever the Chancellor of the Exchequer might be\". Thus, for [0], an economic recovery policy is only fully effective if the trade deficit is eliminated. [0] proposed a 15% tax on manufactured and semi-manufactured goods and 5% on certain foodstuffs and raw materials, with others needed for exports exempted (wool, cotton).In 1932, in an article entitled The Pro- and Anti-Tariffs, published in The Listener, [0] envisaged the protection of farmers and certain sectors such as the automobile and iron and steel industries, considering farmers and certain sectors such as the automobile and iron and steel industries indispensable to the country's.In the post-crisis situation of 1929, [0] judged the assumptions of the free trade model unrealistic. [0] criticised, for example, the neoclassical assumption of wage adjustment.As early as 1930, in a note to the Economic Advisory Council, [0] doubted the intensity of the gain from specialisation in the case of manufactured goods. While participating in the Macmillan Committee to bring the British economy out of the crisis, [0] admitted that [0] no longer \"believed in a very high degree of national specialisation\" and refused to \"abandon any industry which is unable, for the moment, to survive\". [0] also criticised the static dimension of the theory of comparative advantage, which, in [0]'s view, by fixing comparative advantages definitively, led in practice to a waste of national resources.In the Daily Mail of 13 March 1931, [0] called the assumption of perfect sectoral labour mobility \"nonsense\" since the assumption of perfect sectoral labour mobility states that a person made unemployed contributes to a reduction in the wage rate until a person made unemployed finds a job. But for [0], finds may involve costs (job search, training) and is not always possible. Generally speaking, for [0], the assumptions of full employment and automatic return to equilibrium discredit the theory of comparative advantage.In July 1933, [0] published an article in the New Statesman and Nation entitled National Self-Sufficiency, in which [0] criticised the argument of the specialisation of economies, which is the basis of free trade. [0] thus proposed the search for a certain degree of self-sufficiency. Instead of the specialisation of economies advocated by the theory of comparative advantage, [0] prefers the maintenance of a diversity of activities for nations. In an article in the New Statesman and Nation entitled National Self-Sufficiency [0] refutes the principle of peacemaking trade. [0]'s vision of trade became that of a system where foreign capitalists compete for new markets. [0] defends the idea of producing on national soil when possible and reasonable and expresses sympathy for the advocates of protectionism. [0] notes in National Self-Sufficiency:A considerable degree of international specialization is necessary in a rational world in all cases where A considerable degree of international specialization is dictated by wide differences of climate, natural resources, native aptitudes, level of culture and density of population. But over an increasingly wide range of industrial products, and perhaps of agricultural products also, [0] have become doubtful whether the economic loss of national self-sufficiency is great enough to outweigh the other advantages of gradually bringing the product and the consumer within the ambit of the same national, economic, and financial organization. Experience accumulates to prove that most modern processes of mass production can be performed in most countries and climates with almost equal efficiency. [0] also writes in National Self-Sufficiency: [0] sympathize, therefore, with those who would minimize, rather than with those who would maximize, economic entanglement among nations. Ideas, knowledge, science, hospitality, travel\u00a0\u2013 Ideas, knowledge, science, hospitality, travel are the things which should of Ideas, knowledge, science, hospitality, travel's nature be international. But let goods be homespun whenever it is reasonably and conveniently possible, and, above all, let finance be primarily national. Later, [0] had a written correspondence with James Meade centred on the issue of import restrictions. [0] and James Meade discussed the best choice between quota and tariff. In March 1944 [0] began a discussion with Marcus Fleming after Marcus Fleming had written an article entitled Quotas versus depreciation. On this occasion, we see that [0] has definitely taken a protectionist stance after the Great Depression. [0] considered that quotas could be more effective than currency depreciation in dealing with external imbalances. Thus, for [0], currency depreciation was no longer sufficient and protectionist measures became necessary to avoid trade deficits. To avoid the return of crises due to a self-regulating economic system, it seemed essential to [0] to regulate trade and stop free trade (deregulation of foreign trade).He points out that countries that import more than they export countries that import more than they export weaken countries that import more than they export's economies. When the trade deficit increases, unemployment rises and gross domestic product (GDP) slows down. Furthermore, surplus countries exert a \"negative externality\" on their trading partners. surplus countries get richer at the expense of others and destroy the output of their trading partners. [0] believed that the products of surplus countries should be taxed to avoid trade imbalances.", "Views on trade imbalances": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was the principal author of a proposal\u00a0\u2013 the so-called Keynes Plan\u00a0\u2013 for an International Clearing Union. The two governing principles of a proposal\u00a0\u2013 the so-called Keynes Plan\u00a0\u2013 for an International Clearing Union were that the problem of settling outstanding balances should be solved by \"creating\" additional \"international money\", and that debtor and creditor should be treated almost alike as disturbers of equilibrium. In the event, though, a proposal\u00a0\u2013 the so-called Keynes Plan\u00a0\u2013 for an International Clearing Union were rejected, in part because \"American opinion was naturally reluctant to accept the principle of equality of treatment so novel in debtor-creditor relationships\".an International Clearing Union is not founded on free-trade (liberalisation of foreign trade) but rather on the regulation of international trade, to eliminate trade imbalances: the nations with a surplus would have an incentive to reduce a surplus, and in doing so the nations with a surplus would automatically clear other nations deficits. [0] proposed a global bank that would issue its currency\u00a0\u2013 the bancor\u00a0\u2013 which was exchangeable with national currencies at fixed rates of exchange and would become the unit of account between nations, which means its currency\u00a0 would be used to measure a country's trade deficit or trade surplus. Every country would have an overdraft facility in Every country's its currency\u00a0 account at its. [0] pointed out that surpluses lead to weak global aggregate demand\u00a0\u2013 countries running surpluses exert a \"negative externality\" on trading partners, and posed, far more than those in deficit, a threat to global prosperity.In [0]'s 1933 Yale Review article \"National Self-Sufficiency,\" [0] already highlighted the problems created by free trade. [0]'s view, supported by many economists and commentators at the time, was that creditor nations may be just as responsible as debtor nations for disequilibrium in exchanges and that both should be under an obligation to bring trade back into a state of balance. Failure for both to do so could have serious consequences. In the words of Geoffrey Crowther, then editor of The Economist, \"If the economic relationships between nations are not, by one means or another, brought fairly close to balance, then there is no set of financial arrangements that can rescue the world from the impoverishing results of chaos.\"These ideas were informed by events prior to the Great Depression when\u00a0\u2013 in the opinion of [0] and others\u00a0\u2013 international lending, primarily by the US, exceeded the capacity of sound investment and so got diverted into non-productive and speculative uses, which in turn invited default and a sudden stop to the process of lending.Influenced by [0], economics texts in the immediate post-war period put a significant emphasis on balance in trade. For example, the second edition of the popular introductory textbook, An Outline of Money, devoted the last three of the second edition of the popular introductory textbook, An Outline of Money,'s ten chapters to questions of foreign exchange management and in particular the \"problem of balance\". However, in more recent years, since the end of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, with the increasing influence of monetarist schools of thought in the 1980s, and particularly in the face of large sustained trade imbalances, questions of foreign exchange management and in particular the \"problem of balance\" have largely disappeared from mainstream economics discourse and Keynes's insights have slipped from view. Keynes's insights are receiving some attention again in the wake of the financial crisis of 2007\u201308.", "": ""}, "Personal life": {"Relationships": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0]'s early romantic and sexual relationships were exclusively with men. [0] had been in relationships while at Eton and Cambridge; significant among relationships were Dilly Knox and Daniel Macmillan. [0] was open about [0]'s affairs, and from 1901 to 1915 kept separate diaries in which [0] tabulated [0]'s many sexual encounters. [0]'s relationship and later close friendship with Daniel Macmillan was to be fortunate, as Daniel Macmillan's company first published Daniel Macmillan's tract Economic Consequences of the Peace.Attitudes in the Bloomsbury Group, in which Keynes was avidly involved, were relaxed about homosexuality. Keynes, together with writer Lytton Strachey, had reshaped the Victorian attitudes of the Cambridge Apostles: \"since [Keynes, together with writer Lytton Strachey,'s] time, homosexual relations among the Cambridge Apostles were for a time common\", wrote Bertrand Russell. The artist Duncan Grant has been described as \"the supreme male love of [0]'s life\", and their sexual relationship lasted from 1908 to 1915. [0] was also involved with writer Lytton Strachey, though they were, for the most part, love rivals rather than lovers. [0] had won the affections of Arthur Hobhouse, and as with The artist Duncan Grant, fell out with writer Lytton Strachey over the affections of Arthur Hobhouse. writer Lytton Strachey had previously found writer Lytton Strachey put off by [0], not least because of [0]'s manner of \"treat[ing] [0]'s love affairs statistically\".Political opponents have used [0]'s sexuality to attack [0]'s academic work. One line of attack held that [0] was uninterested in the long-term ramifications of [0]'s theories because [0] had no children.[0]'s friends in the Bloomsbury Group, in which Keynes was avidly involved were initially surprised when, in [0]'s later years, [0] began pursuing affairs with women, demonstrating [0] to be bisexual. Ray Costelloe (who later married Oliver Strachey) was an early heterosexual interest of [0]. In 1906, [0] had written of this infatuation that, \"[0] seem to have fallen in love with Ray Costelloe (who later married Oliver Strachey) a little bit, but as Ray Costelloe (who later married Oliver Strachey) isn't male [0] haven't [been] able to think of any suitable steps to take.\"", "Marriage": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 1921, [0] wrote that [0] had fallen \"very much in love\" with Lydia Lopokova, a well-known Russian ballerina and one of the stars of Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. In the early years of [0]'s courtship, [0] maintained an affair with a younger man, Sebastian Sprott, in tandem with Lydia Lopokova, a well-known Russian ballerina and one of the stars of Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, but eventually chose Lydia Lopokova, a well-known Russian ballerina and one of the stars of Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes exclusively. They were married in 1925, with Keynes's former lover Duncan Grant as best man. \"What a marriage of beauty and brains, Lydia Lopokova, a well-known Russian ballerina and one of the stars of Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes [0]\" was said at the time. [0] later commented to Strachey that beauty and intelligence were rarely found in the same person, and that only in Keynes's former lover Duncan Grant had [0] found the combination. married was happy, with biographer Peter Clarke writing that married gave [0] \"a new focus, a new emotional stability and a sheer delight of which [0] never wearied\". They hoped to have children but have did not happen.Among [0]'s Bloomsbury friends, Lydia Lopokova, a well-known Russian ballerina and one of the stars of Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes was, at least initially, subjected to criticism for Lydia Lopokova, a well-known Russian ballerina and one of the stars of Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes's manners, mode of conversation and supposedly humble social origins\u00a0\u2013 the last of the ostensible causes being particularly noted in the letters of Vanessa and Clive Bell, and Virginia Woolf. In Virginia Woolf's novel Mrs Dalloway (1925), Virginia Woolf bases the character of Rezia Warren Smith on Lydia Lopokova, a well-known Russian ballerina and one of the stars of Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. E.\u00a0M.\u00a0Forster later wrote in contrition about \"Lydia Keynes, every whose word should be recorded\"; \"How we all used to underestimate Lydia Lopokova, a well-known Russian ballerina and one of the stars of Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes\".", "Support for the arts": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] thought that the pursuit of money for its own sake the pursuit of money for its own sake's was a pathological condition, and that the proper aim of work is to provide leisure. [0] wanted shorter working hours and longer holidays for all.[0] was interested in literature in general and drama in particular and supported the Cambridge Arts Theatre financially, which allowed the Cambridge Arts Theatre to become one of the major British stages outside London.[0]'s interest in classical opera and dance led [0] to support the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden and the Ballet Company at Sadler's Wells. During the war, as a member of CEMA (Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts), [0] helped secure government funds to maintain the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden and the Ballet Company at Sadler's Wells while the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden and the Ballet Company at Sadler's Wells's venues were shut. Following the war, [0] was instrumental in establishing the Arts Council of Great Britain and was the Arts Council of Great Britain's founding chairman in 1946. From the start, the two organisations that received the largest grants from the Arts Council of Great Britain were the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden and Sadler's Wells.[0] built up a substantial collection of fine art, including works by Paul C\u00e9zanne, Edgar Degas, Amedeo Modigliani, Georges Braque, Pablo Picasso and Georges Seurat (some of which can now be seen at the Fitzwilliam Museum). [0] enjoyed collecting books; [0] collected and protected many of Isaac Newton's papers. In part on the basis of many of Isaac Newton's papers, [0] wrote of Isaac Newton's as \"the last of the magicians.\"", "Philosophical and spiritual views": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0], like other members of the Bloomsbury Group, was greatly influenced by the philosophy of G. E. Moore, which in 1938 [0] described as \"still [0]'s religion under the surface\". According to G. E. Moore, states of mind were the only valuable things in states of mind, the most important being \"the pleasures of human intercourse and the enjoyment of beautiful objects\". Virginia Woolf's's biographer tells an anecdote of how Virginia Woolf, Keynes and T. S. Eliot discussed religion at a dinner party, in the context of Virginia Woolf, Keynes and T. S. Eliot's struggle against Victorian era morality.[0] may have been confirmed, but according to Cambridge University [0] was clearly an agnostic, which [0] remained until [0]'s death. According to one biographer, \"[0] was never able to take religion seriously, regarding religion as a strange aberration of the human mind\" but also added that [0] came to \"value religion for social and moral reasons\" later in life. Another biographer writes that [0] \"broke the family faith and became a 'ferocious agnostic'\" during [0]'s time at Eton. One Cambridge University acquaintance remembered [0] as \"an atheist with a devotion to King's chapel\". At Cambridge University, [0] was strongly associated with the Cambridge Heretics Society, an avowed atheist group which promoted secularism and humanism.", "Investments": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was ultimately a successful investor, building up a private fortune. [0]'s assets were nearly wiped out following the Wall Street Crash of 1929, which [0] did not foresee, but [0] soon recouped. At [0]'s death, in 1946, [0]'s net worth stood just short of \u00a3500,000\u00a0\u2013 equivalent to about \u00a320.5\u00a0million ($27.1\u00a0million) in 2018. just short of \u00a3500,000\u00a0\u2013 equivalent to about \u00a320.5\u00a0million ($27.1\u00a0million) in 2018 had been amassed despite lavish support for various charities and philanthropies and despite [0]'s ethical reluctance to sell on a falling market in cases where [0] saw such behaviour as likely to deepen a slump.[0] managed the endowment of King's College, Cambridge starting in the 1920s, initially with an unsuccessful strategy based on market timing but later shifting to focus in the publicly traded stock of small and medium-size companies that paid large dividends. shifting was a controversial decision at the time, as stocks were considered high-risk and the endowment of King's College, Cambridge had traditionally been invested in agricultural land and fixed income assets like bonds. [0] was granted permission to invest a small minority of assets in stocks, and [0]'s adroit management resulted a small minority of assets the endowment of King's College, Cambridge growing to become the majority of the endowment of King's College, Cambridge's assets. The active component of [0]'s portfolio outperformed a British equity index by an average of 6% to 8% a year over a quarter century, earning [0] favourable mention by later investors such as Warren Buffett and George Soros.Joel Tillinghast of Fidelity Investments describes [0] as an early practitioner of value investing, a school of thought formalised in the US by Benjamin Graham and David Dodd at Columbia Business School during the 1920s and 1930s. However, [0] is believed to have developed [0]'s ideas independently. [0] is also regarded as a pioneer of financial diversification as [0] recognised the importance of holding assets with \"opposed risks\" as [0] wrote \"since assets are likely to move in opposite directions when there are general fluctuations\"; and also as an early international investor who avoided home country bias by investing substantially in stocks outside the US. Ken Fisher characterised [0] as an exception to the rule that economists usually make horrible investors.[0] joined the Board of the National Mutual Life Assurance Society in 1919 and served as chairman from 1921 to 1938. [0] introduced a policy of active trading of the fixed interest stocks, coupled with investment in equities. \u201c[0] was the first to give [investment trading] the seal of respectability and to apply the seal of respectability to a life assurance fund.\u201d Olivier Accominotti and David Chambers have pointed out that [0] did not make use of currency trading and the carry trade in [0]'s investments. [0] understood the strategy however, but considered that in [0]'s time the separation of the interest rates was not sufficient to pay for the costs of transporting the capital as gold, as [0] explained to the Macmillan Committee of 1930.", "Political life": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was a lifelong member of the Liberal Party, which until the 1920s had been one of the two main political parties in the United Kingdom, and as late as 1916 had often been the dominant power in government. [0] had helped campaign for the Liberals at elections from about 1906, yet [0] always refused to run for office [0], despite being asked to do so on three separate occasions in 1920. From 1926, when Lloyd George became leader of the Liberals, [0] took a major role in defining the Liberals's economic policy, but by then the Liberals had been displaced into third-party status by the growing workers-oriented Labour Party.In 1939 [0] had the option to enter Parliament as an independent MP with the University of Cambridge seat. A by-election for the University of Cambridge seat was to be held due to the illness of an elderly Tory, and the master of Magdalene College had obtained agreement that none of the major parties would field a candidate if [0] chose to stand. [0] declined the option to enter Parliament as an independent MP as [0] felt [0] would wield greater influence on events if [0] remained a free agent.[0] was a proponent of eugenics. [0] served as director of the British Eugenics Society from 1937 to 1944. As late as 1946, shortly before [0]'s death, [0] declared eugenics to be \"the most important, significant and, [0] would add, genuine branch of sociology which exists.[0] once remarked that \"the youth had no religion save communism and communism was worse than nothing.\" Marxism \"was founded upon nothing better than a misunderstanding of Ricardo\", and, given time, [0]) \"would deal thoroughly with the Marxists\" and other economists to solve the economic problems the Marxists\" and other economists's theories \"threaten to cause\".In 1931 [0] had the following to say on Leninism:How can [0] accept a doctrine, which sets up as its bible, above and beyond criticism, an obsolete textbook which [0] know not only to be scientifically erroneous but without interest or application to the modern world? How can [0] adopt a creed which, preferring the mud to the fish, exalts the boorish proletariat above the bourgeoisie and the intelligentsia, who with all their faults, are the quality of life and surely carry the seeds of all human achievement? Even if we need a religion, how can we find a religion in the turbid rubbish of the red bookshop? It is hard for an educated, decent, intelligent son of Western Europe to find an educated, decent, intelligent son of Western Europe's ideals here, unless an educated, decent, intelligent son of Western Europe has first suffered some strange and horrid process of conversion which has changed all an educated, decent, intelligent son of Western Europe's values. [0] was a firm supporter of women's rights and in 1932 became vice-chairman of the Marie Stopes Society which provided birth control education. [0] also campaigned against job discrimination against women and unequal pay. [0] was an outspoken campaigner for reform of the laws against homosexuality.", "Heraldic arms": "", "Death": "[0] is our person to focus on. Throughout [0]'s life, [0] worked energetically for the benefit both of the public and [0]'s friends; even when [0]'s health was poor, [0] laboured to sort out the finances of [0]'s old college. Helping to set up the Bretton Woods system, [0] worked to institute an international monetary system that would be beneficial for the world economy. In 1946, [0] suffered a series of heart attacks, which ultimately proved fatal. a series of heart attacks, which ultimately proved fatal began during negotiations for the Anglo-American loan in Savannah, Georgia, where [0] was trying to secure favourable terms for the United Kingdom from the United States, a process [0] described as \"absolute hell\". A few weeks after returning from the United States, [0] died of a heart attack at Tilton, his farmhouse home near Firle, East Sussex, England, on 21 April 1946, at the age of 62. Against [0]'s wishes ([0] wanted [0]'s to be deposited in the crypt at King's), [0]'s were scattered on the Downs above Tilton, his farmhouse home near Firle, East Sussex, England,.Both of [0]'s parents outlived [0]: [0]'s father John Neville Keynes (1852\u20131949) by three years, and [0]'s mother Florence Ada Keynes (1861\u20131958) by twelve.
