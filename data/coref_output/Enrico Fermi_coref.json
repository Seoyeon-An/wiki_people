{"summary": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] (Italian: [en\u02c8ri\u02d0ko \u02c8fermi]; 29 September 1901 \u2013 28 November 1954) was an Italian and later naturalized American physicist, renowned for being the creator of the world's first nuclear reactor, the Chicago Pile-1, and a member of the Manhattan Project. [0] has been called the \"architect of the nuclear age\" and the \"architect of the atomic bomb\". [0] was one of very few physicists to excel in both theoretical physics and experimental physics. [0] was awarded the 1938 Nobel Prize in Physics for [0]'s work on induced radioactivity by neutron bombardment and for the discovery of transuranium elements. With [0]'s colleagues, [0] filed several patents related to the use of nuclear power, all of which were taken over by the US government. [0] made significant contributions to the development of statistical mechanics, quantum theory, and nuclear and particle physics.[0]'s first major contribution involved the field of statistical mechanics. After Wolfgang Pauli formulated his exclusion principle in 1925, [0] followed with a paper in which [0] applied his exclusion principle to an ideal gas, employing a statistical formulation now known as [0]\u2013Dirac statistics. Today, particles that obey his exclusion principle are called \"fermions\". Wolfgang Pauli later postulated the existence of an uncharged invisible particle emitted along with an electron during beta decay, to satisfy the law of conservation of energy. [0] took up postulated, developing a model that incorporated an uncharged invisible particle emitted along with an electron during beta decay. [0]'s theory, later referred to as [0]'s interaction and now called weak interaction, described one of the four fundamental interactions in nature. Through experiments inducing radioactivity with the recently discovered neutron, [0] discovered that slow neutrons were more easily captured by atomic nuclei than fast ones, and [0] developed the Fermi age equation to describe were. After bombarding thorium and uranium with slow neutrons, [0] concluded that [0] had created new elements. Although [0] was awarded the 1938 Nobel Prize in Physics for created, new elements were later revealed to be nuclear fission products.[0] left Italy in 1938 to escape new Italian racial laws that affected [0]'s Jewish wife, Laura Capon. [0] emigrated to the United States, where [0] worked on the Manhattan Project during World War II. [0] led the team at the University of Chicago that designed and built Chicago Pile-1, which went critical on 2 December 1942, demonstrating the first human-created, self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction. [0] was on hand when the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge, Tennessee went critical in 1943, and when the B Reactor at the Hanford Site did so the next year. At Los Alamos, [0] headed F Division, part of which worked on Edward Teller's thermonuclear \"Super\" bomb. [0] was present at the Trinity test on 16 July 1945, where [0] used [0]'s [0] method to estimate Edward Teller's thermonuclear \"Super\" bomb's yield.After World War II, [0] served under J. Robert Oppenheimer on the General Advisory Committee, which advised the Atomic Energy Commission on nuclear matters. After the detonation of the first Soviet fission bomb in August 1949, [0] strongly opposed the development of a hydrogen bomb on both moral and technical grounds. [0] was among the scientists who testified on J. Robert Oppenheimer's behalf at the 1954 hearing that resulted in the denial of J. Robert Oppenheimer's security clearance. [0] did important work in particle physics, especially related to pions and muons, and [0] speculated that cosmic rays arose when material was accelerated by magnetic fields in interstellar space. Many awards, concepts, and institutions are named after [0], including the [0] Award, the Enrico Fermi Institute, the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab), the [0] Gamma-ray Space Telescope, the [0] paradox, and the synthetic element fermium, making [0] one of 16 scientists who have elements named after them16 scientists who have elements named after them."}, "Early life": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was born in Rome, Italy, on 29 September 1901. [0] was the third child of Alberto Fermi, a division head in the Ministry of Railways, and Ida de Gattis, an elementary school teacher. His sister, Maria, was two years older, his brother Giulio a year older. After the two boys were sent to a rural community to be wet nursed, [0] rejoined his family in Rome, Italy, when [0] was two and a half. Although [0] was baptized a Roman Catholic in accordance with [0]'s grandparents' wishes, his family was not particularly religious; [0] continued to pray throughout [0]'s life and attached great importance to the idea of God.  As a young boy, [0] shared the same interests as his brother Giulio, building electric motors and playing with electrical and mechanical toys. his brother Giulio died during an operation on a throat abscess in 1915 and His sister, Maria, died in an airplane crash near Milan in 1959.At a local market in Campo de' Fiori, [0] found a physics book, the 900-page Elementorum physicae mathematicae. Written in Latin by Jesuit Father Andrea Caraffa\u00a0[it], a professor at the Collegio Romano, a physics book, the 900-page Elementorum physicae mathematicae presented mathematics, classical mechanics, astronomy, optics, and acoustics as mathematics, classical mechanics, astronomy, optics, and acoustics were understood at the time of a physics book, the 900-page Elementorum physicae mathematicae's 1840 publication. With a scientifically inclined friend, Enrico Persico, [0] pursued projects such as building gyroscopes and measuring the acceleration of Earth's gravity.In 1914, [0] Alberto Fermi, a division head in the Ministry of Railways, met a colleague of his father called Adolfo Amidei, who would walk part of the way home with Alberto. [0] had learned that a colleague of his father called Adolfo Amidei, who would walk part of the way home with Alberto was interested in mathematics and physics and took the opportunity to ask a colleague of his father called Adolfo Amidei, who would walk part of the way home with Alberto a question about geometry. a colleague of his father called Adolfo Amidei, who would walk part of the way home with Alberto understood that [0] was referring to projective geometry and then proceeded to give [0] a book on the subject written by Theodor Reye. Two months later, [0] returned a book on the subject written by Theodor Reye, having solved all the problems proposed at the end of a book on the subject written by Theodor Reye, some of which a colleague of his father called Adolfo Amidei, who would walk part of the way home with Alberto considered difficult. Upon verifying solved, a colleague of his father called Adolfo Amidei, who would walk part of the way home with Alberto felt that [0] was \"a prodigy, at least with respect to geometry\", and further mentored [0], providing [0] with more books on physics and mathematics. a colleague of his father called Adolfo Amidei, who would walk part of the way home with Alberto noted that [0] had a very good memory and thus could return a book on the subject written by Theodor Reye after having read a book on the subject written by Theodor Reye because [0] could remember a book on the subject written by Theodor Reye's content very well."}, "Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] graduated from high school in July 1918, having skipped the third year entirely. At Amidei's's urging, [0] learned German to be able to read the many scientific papers that were published in German at the time, and [0] applied to the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa. Amidei's felt that the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa would provide better conditions for [0]'s development than the Sapienza University of Rome could at the time. Having lost one son, [0]'s parents only reluctantly allowed [0] to live in the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa's lodgings away from the Sapienza University of Rome for four years. [0] took first place in the difficult entrance exam, which included an essay on the theme of \"Specific characteristics of Sounds\"; [0] chose to use Fourier analysis to derive and solve the partial differential equation for a vibrating rod, and after interviewing [0] the examiner declared [0] would become an outstanding physicist.At the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa, [0] played pranks with fellow student Franco Rasetti; the two became close friends and collaborators. [0] was advised by Luigi Puccianti, director of the physics laboratory, who said there was little he could teach Fermi and often asked Fermi to teach him something insteadLuigi Puccianti, director of the physics laboratory, who said there was little he could teach Fermi and often asked Fermi to teach him something instead Luigi Puccianti, director of the physics laboratory, who said there was little he could teach Fermi and often asked Fermi to teach him something instead . [0]'s knowledge of quantum physics was such that Luigi Puccianti, director of the physics laboratory, who said there was little he could teach Fermi and often asked Fermi to teach him something instead asked [0] to organize seminars on quantum physics. During this time [0] learned tensor calculus, a technique key to general relativity. [0] initially chose mathematics as [0]'s major, but soon switched to physics. [0] remained largely self-taught, studying general relativity, quantum mechanics, and atomic physics.In September 1920, [0] was admitted to the physics department. Since there were only three students in the physics department\u2014Fermi, Rasetti, and Nello Carrara\u2014Luigi Puccianti, director of the physics laboratory, who said there was little he could teach Fermi and often asked Fermi to teach him something instead let Fermi, Rasetti, and Nello Carrara freely use the physics laboratory for whatever purposes Fermi, Rasetti, and Nello Carrara chose. [0] decided that Fermi, Rasetti, and Nello Carrara should research X-ray crystallography, and Fermi, Rasetti, and Nello Carrara worked to produce a Laue photograph\u2014an X-ray photograph of a crystal. During 1921, [0]'s third year at the university, [0] published [0]'s first scientific works in the Italian journal Nuovo Cimento. The first was entitled \"On the dynamics of a rigid system of electrical charges in translational motion\" (Sulla dinamica di un sistema rigido di cariche elettriche in moto traslatorio). A sign of things to come was that the mass was expressed as a tensor\u2014a mathematical construct commonly used to describe something moving and changing in three-dimensional space. In classical mechanics, mass is a scalar quantity, but in relativity, mass changes with velocity. The second paper was \"On the electrostatics of a uniform gravitational field of electromagnetic charges and on the weight of electromagnetic charges\" (Sull'elettrostatica di un campo gravitazionale uniforme e sul peso delle masse elettromagnetiche). Using general relativity, [0] showed that a charge has a weight equal to U/c2, where U was the electrostatic energy of the system, and c is the speed of light.The first seemed to point out a contradiction between the electrodynamic theory and the relativistic one concerning the calculation of the electromagnetic masses, as the electrodynamic theory predicted a value of 4/3 U/c2. [0] addressed a contradiction between the electrodynamic theory and the relativistic one concerning the calculation of the electromagnetic masses the next year in a paper \"Concerning a contradiction between electrodynamic and the relativistic theory of electromagnetic mass\" in which he showed that the apparent contradiction was a consequence of relativity. a paper \"Concerning a contradiction between electrodynamic and the relativistic theory of electromagnetic mass\" in which he showed that the apparent contradiction was a consequence of relativity was sufficiently well-regarded that a paper \"Concerning a contradiction between electrodynamic and the relativistic theory of electromagnetic mass\" in which he showed that the apparent contradiction was a consequence of relativity was translated into German and published in the German scientific journal Physikalische Zeitschrift in 1922. 1922, [0] submitted his article \"On the phenomena occurring near a world line\" (Sopra i fenomeni che avvengono in vicinanza di una linea oraria) to the Italian journal I Rendiconti dell'Accademia dei Lincei\u00a0[it]. In his article \"On the phenomena occurring near a world line\" [0] examined the Principle of Equivalence, and introduced the so-called \"[0] coordinates\". [0] proved that on a world line close to the timeline, space behaves as if space were a Euclidean space.[0] submitted his thesis, \"A theorem on probability and some of its applications\" (Un teorema di calcolo delle probabilit\u00e0 ed alcune sue applicazioni), to the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa in July 1922, and received [0]'s laurea at the unusually young age of 20. his thesis, \"A theorem on probability and some of its applications\" (Un teorema di calcolo delle probabilit\u00e0 ed alcune sue applicazioni) was on X-ray diffraction images. Theoretical physics was not yet considered a discipline in Italy, and the only thesis that would have been accepted was experimental physics. For this reason, Italian physicists were slow in embracing the new ideas like relativity coming from Germany. Since [0] was quite at home in the lab doing experimental work, this did not pose insurmountable problems for [0].While writing the appendix for the Italian edition of the book Fundamentals of Einstein Relativity by August Kopff in 1923, [0] was the first to point out that hidden inside the Einstein equation (E = mc2) was an enormous amount of nuclear potential energy to be exploited. \"It does not seem possible, at least in the near future\", [0] wrote, \"to find a way to release an enormous amount of nuclear potential energy to be exploited\u2014which is all to the good because the first effect of an explosion of an enormous amount of nuclear potential energy to be exploited would be to smash into smithereens the physicist who had the misfortune to find a way to do release.\"In 1924, [0] was initiated into the Masonic Lodge \"Adriano Lemmi\" of the Grand Orient of Italy.In 1924, [0] spent a semester studying under Max Born at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, where [0] met Werner Heisenberg and Pascual Jordan. [0] then studied in Leiden with Paul Ehrenfest from September to December 1924 on a fellowship from the Rockefeller Foundation obtained through the intercession of the mathematician Vito Volterra. Here [0] met Hendrik Lorentz and Einstein, and became friends with Samuel Goudsmit and Jan Tinbergen. From January 1925 to late 1926, [0] taught mathematical physics and theoretical mechanics at the University of Florence, where [0] teamed up with fellow student Franco Rasetti to conduct a series of experiments on the effects of magnetic fields on mercury vapor. [0] also participated in seminars at the Sapienza University of Rome, giving lectures on quantum mechanics and solid state physics. While giving lectures on the new quantum mechanics based on the remarkable accuracy of predictions of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, [0] would often say, \"It has no business to fit so well!\"After Wolfgang Pauli announced his exclusion principle in 1925, [0] responded with a paper \"On the quantization of the perfect monoatomic gas\" (Sulla quantizzazione del gas perfetto monoatomico), in which [0] applied his exclusion principle to an ideal gas. a paper \"On the quantization of the perfect monoatomic gas\" (Sulla quantizzazione del gas perfetto monoatomico) was especially notable for Fermi's statistical formulation, which describes the distribution of particles in systems of many identical particles that obey the exclusion principle. Fermi's statistical formulation, which describes the distribution of particles in systems of many identical particles that obey the exclusion principle was independently developed soon after by the British physicist Paul Dirac, who also showed how it was related to the Bose\u2013Einstein statisticsFermi's statistical formulation, which describes the distribution of particles in systems of many identical particles that obey the exclusion principle . Accordingly, Fermi's statistical formulation, which describes the distribution of particles in systems of many identical particles that obey the exclusion principle is now known as [0]\u2013Dirac statistics. After the British physicist Paul Dirac, who also showed how it was related to the Bose\u2013Einstein statistics, particles that obey his exclusion principle are today called \"fermions\", while those that do not are called \"bosons\"."}, "Professor in Rome": {"": "Enrico Fermi is our person to focus on. Professorships in Italy were granted by competition (concorso) for a vacant chair, [0] being rated on [0]'s publications by a committee of professors. Enrico Fermi applied for a chair of mathematical physics at the University of Cagliari on Sardinia, but was narrowly passed over in favour of Giovanni Giorgi. In 1926, at the age of 24, Enrico Fermi applied for a professorship at the Sapienza University of Rome. a professorship at the Sapienza University of Rome was a new chair, one of the first three in theoretical physics in Italy, that had been created by the Minister of Education at the urging of professor Orso Mario Corbino, who was the Sapienza University of Rome's professor of experimental physics, the director of the Institute of Physics, and a member of Benito Mussolini's's cabinet. Corbino, who also chaired the selection committee, hoped that a professorship at the Sapienza University of Rome would raise the standard and reputation of physics in Italy. a committee of professors chose Enrico Fermi ahead of Enrico Persico and Aldo Pontremoli, and Corbino, who also chaired the selection committee helped Enrico Fermi recruit Enrico Fermi's team, which was soon joined by notable students such as Edoardo Amaldi, Bruno Pontecorvo, Ettore Majorana and Emilio Segr\u00e8, and by Franco Rasetti, whom Enrico Fermi had appointed as Enrico Fermi's assistant. They soon nicknamed the \"Via Panisperna boys\" after the street where the Institute of Physics was located.Enrico Fermi married Laura Capon, a science student at the Sapienza University of Rome, on 19 July 1928. They had two children: Nella, born in January 1931, and Giulio, born in February 1936. On 18 March 1929, Enrico Fermi was appointed a member of the Royal Academy of Italy by Benito Mussolini's, and on 27 April Enrico Fermi joined the Fascist Party. Enrico Fermi later opposed Fascism when the 1938 racial laws were promulgated by Benito Mussolini's in order to bring Italian Fascism ideologically closer to German Nazism. the 1938 racial laws threatened Laura, who was Jewish, and put many of Enrico Fermi's research assistants out of work.During They's time in the Sapienza University of Rome, Enrico Fermi Enrico Fermi's made important contributions to many practical and theoretical aspects of physics. In 1928, Enrico Fermi published Enrico Fermi's Introduction to Atomic Physics (Introduzione alla fisica atomica), which provided Italian university students with an up-to-date and accessible text. Enrico Fermi also conducted public lectures and wrote popular articles for scientists and teachers in order to spread knowledge of the new physics as widely as possible. Part of Enrico Fermi's teaching method was to gather Enrico Fermi's colleagues and graduate students together at the end of the day and go over a problem, often from Enrico Fermi's own research. A sign of success was that foreign students now began to come to Italy. The most notable of foreign students was the German physicist Hans Bethe, who came to the Sapienza University of Rome as a Rockefeller Foundation fellow, and collaborated with Enrico Fermi on a 1932 paper \"On the Interaction between Two Electrons\" (German: \u00dcber die Wechselwirkung von Zwei Elektronen).At this time, physicists were puzzled by beta decay, in which an electron was emitted from the atomic nucleus. To satisfy the law of conservation of energy, Benito Mussolini's postulated the existence of an invisible particle with no charge and little or no mass that was also emitted at the same time. Enrico Fermi took up this idea, which Enrico Fermi developed in a tentative paper in 1933, and then a longer paper the next year that incorporated an invisible particle with no charge and little or no mass that was also emitted at the same time. His theory, later referred to as Fermi's interaction, and still later as the theory of the weak interaction, described one of the four fundamental forces of nature. The neutrino was detected after Enrico Fermi's death, and His theory, later referred to as Fermi's interaction, and still later as the theory of the weak interaction showed why The neutrino was so difficult to detect. When Enrico Fermi submitted his paper to the British journal Nature, the British journal Nature's editor turned his paper down because his paper contained speculations which were \"too remote from physical reality to be of interest to readers\". Thus Enrico Fermi saw His theory, later referred to as Fermi's interaction, and still later as the theory of the weak interaction published in Italian and German before His theory, later referred to as Fermi's interaction, and still later as the theory of the weak interaction was published in English.In the introduction to the 1968 English translation, physicist Fred L. Wilson noted that: His theory, later referred to as Fermi's interaction, and still later as the theory of the weak interaction, aside from bolstering Benito Mussolini's's proposal of the neutrino, has a special significance in the history of modern physics. One must remember that only the naturally occurring \u03b2 emitters were known at the time His theory, later referred to as Fermi's interaction, and still later as the theory of the weak interaction was proposed. Later when positron decay was discovered, positron decay was easily incorporated within Enrico Fermi's original framework. On the basis of His theory, later referred to as Fermi's interaction, and still later as the theory of the weak interaction, the capture of an orbital electron by a nucleus was predicted and eventually observed. With time, experimental data accumulated significantly. Although peculiarities have been observed many times in \u03b2 decay, His theory, later referred to as Fermi's interaction, and still later as the theory of the weak interaction always has been equal to the challenge.The consequences of His theory, later referred to as Fermi's interaction, and still later as the theory of the weak interaction are vast. For example, \u03b2 spectroscopy was established as a powerful tool for the study of nuclear structure. But perhaps the most influential aspect of this work of Enrico Fermi is that Enrico Fermi's particular form of the \u03b2 interaction established a pattern that has been appropriate for the study of other types of interactions. His theory, later referred to as Fermi's interaction, and still later as the theory of the weak interaction was the first successful theory of the creation and annihilation of material particles. Previously, only photons had been known to be created and destroyed. In January 1934, Ir\u00e8ne Joliot-Curie and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Joliot announced that Ir\u00e8ne Joliot-Curie and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Joliot had bombarded elements with alpha particles and induced radioactivity in elements. By March, Enrico Fermi's assistant Gian-Carlo Wick had provided a theoretical explanation using His theory, later referred to as Fermi's interaction, and still later as the theory of the weak interaction. Enrico Fermi decided to switch to experimental physics, using the neutron, which James Chadwick had discovered in 1932. In March 1934, Enrico Fermi wanted to see if Enrico Fermi could induce radioactivity with Rasetti's polonium-beryllium neutron source. Neutrons had no electric charge, and so would not be deflected by the positively charged nucleus. This meant that Neutrons needed much less energy to penetrate the nucleus than charged particles, and so would not require a particle accelerator, which the Via Panisperna boys did not have.Enrico Fermi had the idea to resort to replacing Rasetti's polonium-beryllium neutron source with a radon-beryllium one, which Enrico Fermi created by filling a glass bulb with beryllium powder, evacuating the air, and then adding 50 mCi of radon gas, supplied by Giulio Cesare Trabacchi. This created a much stronger neutron source, the effectiveness of which declined with the 3.8-day half-life of radon. Enrico Fermi knew that a much stronger neutron source, the effectiveness of which declined with the 3.8-day half-life of radon would also emit gamma rays, but, on the basis of His theory, later referred to as Fermi's interaction, and still later as the theory of the weak interaction, Enrico Fermi believed that emit would not affect the results of the experiment. Enrico Fermi started by bombarding platinum, an element with a high atomic number that was readily available, without success. Enrico Fermi turned to aluminium, which emitted an alpha particle and produced sodium, which then decayed into magnesium by beta particle emission. Enrico Fermi tried lead, without success, and then fluorine in the form of calcium fluoride, which emitted an alpha particle and produced nitrogen, decaying into oxygen by beta particle emission. In all, Enrico Fermi induced radioactivity in 22 different elements. Enrico Fermi rapidly reported the discovery of neutron-induced radioactivity in the Italian journal La Ricerca Scientifica on 25 March 1934.The natural radioactivity of thorium and uranium made it hard to determine what was happening when thorium and uranium were bombarded with neutrons but, after correctly eliminating the presence of elements lighter than uranium but heavier than lead, Enrico Fermi concluded that They had created new elements, which Enrico Fermi called hesperium and ausonium. The chemist Ida Noddack suggested that some of the experiments could have produced lighter elements than lead rather than new, heavier elements. The chemist Ida Noddack's was not taken seriously at the time because The chemist Ida Noddack's team had not carried out any experiments with uranium or built the theoretical basis for uranium. At that time, fission was thought to be improbable if not impossible on theoretical grounds. While physicists expected elements with higher atomic numbers to form from neutron bombardment of lighter elements, nobody expected neutrons to have enough energy to split a heavier atom into two light element fragments in the manner that The chemist Ida Noddack suggested.The Via Panisperna boys also noticed some unexplained effects. The experiment seemed to work better on a wooden table than on a marble tabletop. Enrico Fermi remembered that Joliot-Curie and James Chadwick had noted that paraffin wax was effective at slowing neutrons, so Enrico Fermi decided to try paraffin wax. When neutrons were passed through paraffin wax, neutrons induced a hundred times as much radioactivity in silver compared with when silver was bombarded without paraffin wax. Enrico Fermi guessed that induced was due to the hydrogen atoms in paraffin wax. Those in wood similarly explained the difference between the wooden and the marble tabletops. explained was confirmed by repeating the effect with water. Enrico Fermi concluded that collisions with hydrogen atoms slowed the neutrons. The lower the atomic number of the nucleus it collides with, the more energy a neutron loses per collision, and therefore the fewer collisions that are required to slow a neutron down by a given amount. Enrico Fermi realised that this induced more radioactivity because slow neutrons were more easily captured than fast ones. Enrico Fermi developed a diffusion equation to describe this, which became known as the Fermi age equation.In 1938, Enrico Fermi received the Nobel Prize in Physics at the age of 37 for Enrico Fermi's \"demonstrations of the existence of new radioactive elements produced by neutron irradiation, and for Enrico Fermi's related discovery of nuclear reactions brought about by slow neutrons\". After Enrico Fermi received the Nobel Prize in Physics in Stockholm, Enrico Fermi did not return home to Italy but rather continued to New York City with Enrico Fermi's in December 1938, where They applied for permanent residency. The decision to move to America and become US citizens was due primarily to the racial laws in Italy."}, "Manhattan Project": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] arrived in New York City on 2 January 1939. [0] was immediately offered positions at five universities, and accepted one at Columbia University, where he had already given summer lectures in 1936. [0] received the news that in December 1938, the German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann had detected the element barium after bombarding uranium with neutrons, which Lise Meitner and her nephew Otto Frisch correctly interpreted as the result of nuclear fission. her nephew Otto Frisch confirmed detected experimentally on 13 January 1939. The news of Meitner and Frisch's interpretation of Hahn and Strassmann's discovery crossed the Atlantic with Niels Bohr, who was to lecture at Princeton University. Isidor Isaac Rabi and Willis Lamb, two Columbia University physicists working at Princeton, found out about The news of Meitner and Frisch's interpretation of Hahn and Strassmann's discovery and carried The news of Meitner and Frisch's interpretation of Hahn and Strassmann's discovery back to Columbia. Isidor Isaac Rabi said Isidor Isaac Rabi told [0], but [0] later gave the credit to Willis Lamb:Isidor Isaac Rabi remember very vividly the first month, January, 1939, that I started working at the Pupin Laboratories because things began happening very fast. In the first month, January, 1939, that I started working at the Pupin Laboratories, Niels Bohr, who was to lecture at Princeton University was on a lecture engagement at Princeton University and Isidor Isaac Rabi remember one afternoon Willis Lamb came back very excited and said that Niels Bohr, who was to lecture at Princeton University had leaked out great news. great news was detected fission and at least the outline of fission's interpretation. Then, somewhat later that same month, there was a meeting in Washington where the possible importance of fission was first discussed in semi-jocular earnest as a possible source of nuclear power. Noddack was proven right after all. [0] had dismissed the possibility of fission on the basis of [0]'s calculations, but [0] had not taken into account the binding energy that would appear when a nuclide with an odd number of neutrons absorbed an extra neutron. For [0], The news of Meitner and Frisch's interpretation of Hahn and Strassmann's discovery came as a profound embarrassment, as the transuranic elements that [0] had partly been awarded the Nobel Prize for discovering had not been transuranic elements at all, but fission products. [0] added a footnote to this effect to [0]'s the Nobel Prize acceptance speech.The scientists at Columbia decided that The scientists at Columbia should try to detect the energy released in the nuclear fission of uranium when bombarded by neutrons. On 25 January 1939, in the basement of Pupin Hall at Columbia, an experimental team including Fermi conducted the first nuclear fission experiment in the United States. The other members of an experimental team including Fermi were Herbert L. Anderson, Eugene T. Booth, John R. Dunning, G. Norris Glasoe, and Francis G. Slack. The next day, the Fifth Washington Conference on Theoretical Physics began in Washington, D.C. under the joint auspices of George Washington University and the Carnegie Institution of Washington. There, the news on nuclear fission was spread even further, fostering many more experimental demonstrations.French scientists Hans von Halban, Lew Kowarski, and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Joliot-Curie had demonstrated that uranium bombarded by neutrons emitted more neutrons than uranium bombarded by neutrons absorbed, suggesting the possibility of a chain reaction. Isidor Isaac Rabi and Willis Lamb, two Columbia University physicists working at Princeton did so too a few weeks later. Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd obtained 200 kilograms (440\u00a0lb) of uranium oxide from Canadian radium producer Eldorado Gold Mines Limited, allowing Isidor Isaac Rabi and Willis Lamb, two Columbia University physicists working at Princeton to conduct experiments with fission on a much larger scale. Isidor Isaac Rabi and Willis Lamb, two Columbia University physicists working at Princeton collaborated on the design of a device to achieve a self-sustaining nuclear reaction\u2014a nuclear reactor. Owing to the rate of absorption of neutrons by the hydrogen in water, it was unlikely that a self-sustaining reaction could be achieved with natural uranium and water as a neutron moderator. [0] suggested, based on [0]'s work with neutrons, that a self-sustaining reaction could be achieved with uranium oxide blocks and graphite as a moderator instead of water. This would reduce the neutron capture rate, and in theory make a self-sustaining chain reaction possible. Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd came up with a workable design: a pile of uranium oxide blocks interspersed with graphite bricks. Szil\u00e1rd, Anderson, and Fermi published a paper on \"Neutron Production in Uranium\". But Szil\u00e1rd, Anderson, and Fermi's work habits and personalities were different, and [0] had trouble working with Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd.[0] was among the first to warn military leaders about the potential impact of nuclear energy, giving a lecture on nuclear energy at the Navy Department on 18\u00a0March 1939. The response fell short of what [0] had hoped for, although the Navy Department agreed to provide $1,500 towards further research at Columbia. Later that year, Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd, Eugene Wigner, and Edward Teller sent the letter signed by Einstein to US president Franklin D. Roosevelt, warning that Nazi Germany was likely to build an atomic bomb. In response, US president Franklin D. Roosevelt formed the Advisory Committee on Uranium to investigate the matter.the Advisory Committee on Uranium to investigate the matter provided money for [0] to buy graphite, and [0] built a pile of graphite bricks on the seventh floor of the Pupin Laboratories. By August 1941, [0] had six tons of uranium oxide and thirty tons of graphite, which [0] used to build a still larger pile in Schermerhorn Hall at Columbia.The S-1 Section of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, as the Advisory Committee on Uranium was now known, met on 18 December 1941, with the United States now engaged in World War II, making The S-1 Section of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, as the Advisory Committee on Uranium was now known,'s work urgent. Most of the effort sponsored by the Advisory Committee on Uranium to investigate the matter had been directed at producing enriched uranium, but Committee member Arthur Compton determined that a feasible alternative was plutonium, which could be mass-produced in nuclear reactors by the end of 1944. Committee member Arthur Compton decided to concentrate the plutonium work at the University of Chicago. [0] reluctantly moved, and his team became part of the new Metallurgical Laboratory there.The possible results of a self-sustaining nuclear reaction were unknown, so it seemed inadvisable to build the first nuclear reactor on the the University of Chicago campus in the middle of the city. Committee member Arthur Compton found a location in the Argonne Woods Forest Preserve, about 20 miles (32\u00a0km) from Chicago. Stone & Webster was contracted to develop a location in the Argonne Woods Forest Preserve, about 20 miles (32\u00a0km) from Chicago, but the work was halted by an industrial dispute. [0] then persuaded Committee member Arthur Compton that Committee member Arthur Compton could build the first nuclear reactor in the squash court under the stands of the University of Chicago's Stagg Field. Construction of the first nuclear reactor began on 6 November 1942, and Chicago Pile-1 went critical on 2 December. The shape of the first nuclear reactor was intended to be roughly spherical, but as work proceeded [0] calculated that criticality could be achieved without finishing the first nuclear reactor as planned.This experiment was a landmark in the quest for energy, and This experiment was typical of [0]'s approach. Every step was carefully planned, and every calculation was meticulously done. When the first self-sustained nuclear chain reaction was achieved, Committee member Arthur Compton made a coded phone call to James B. Conant, the chairman of the National Defense Research Committee. [0] picked up the phone and called James B. Conant, the chairman of the National Defense Research Committee. James B. Conant, the chairman of the National Defense Research Committee was reached at the President's office at Harvard University.James B. Conant, the chairman of the National Defense Research Committee,\" [0] said, \"James B. Conant, the chairman of the National Defense Research Committee'll be interested to know that the Italian navigator has just landed in the new world.\" Then, half apologetically, because [0] had led the Advisory Committee on Uranium to investigate the matter to believe that it would be another week or more before the first nuclear reactor could be completed, [0] added, \"the earth was not as large as the Italian navigator had estimated, and the Italian navigator arrived at the new world sooner than the Italian navigator had expected.\"\"Is arrived so,\" was James B. Conant, the chairman of the National Defense Research Committee's excited response. \"Were the natives friendly?\"\"Everyone landed safe and happy.\"  To continue the research where the research would not pose a public health hazard, the first nuclear reactor was disassembled and moved to the Argonne Woods site. There [0] directed experiments on nuclear reactions, reveling in the opportunities provided by the first nuclear reactor's abundant production of free neutrons. The laboratory soon branched out from physics and engineering into using the first nuclear reactor for biological and medical research. Initially, The laboratory was run by [0] as part of the University of Chicago, but The laboratory became a separate entity with [0] The laboratory's in May 1944.When the air-cooled X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge went critical on 4 November 1943, [0] was on hand just in case something went wrong. The technicians woke [0] early so that [0] could see something happen. Getting the air-cooled X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge operational was another milestone in the plutonium project. the air-cooled X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge provided data on reactor design, training for DuPont staff in reactor operation, and produced the first small quantities of reactor-bred plutonium. [0] became an American citizen in July 1944, the earliest date the law allowed.In September 1944, [0] inserted the first uranium fuel slug into the B Reactor at the Hanford Site, the production reactor designed to breed plutonium in large quantities. Like the air-cooled X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge, the B Reactor at the Hanford Site, the production reactor designed to breed plutonium in large quantities had been designed by [0]'s team at the Metallurgical Laboratory and built by DuPont, but the B Reactor at the Hanford Site, the production reactor designed to breed plutonium in large quantities was much larger and was water-cooled. Over the next few days, 838 tubes were loaded, and the first nuclear reactor went critical. Shortly after midnight on 27 September, the operators began to withdraw the control rods to initiate production. At first, all appeared to be well, but around 03:00, the power level started to drop and by 06:30 the first nuclear reactor had shut down completely. The Army and DuPont turned to his team for answers. The cooling water was investigated to see if there was a leak or contamination. The next day the first nuclear reactor suddenly started up again, only to shut down once more a few hours later. The problem was traced to neutron poisoning from xenon-135 or Xe-135, a fission product with a half-life of 9.1 to 9.4 hours. Fermi and John Wheeler both deduced that Xe-135 was responsible for absorbing neutrons in the first nuclear reactor, thereby sabotaging the fission process. [0] was recommended by colleague Emilio Segr\u00e8 to ask Chien-Shiung Wu, as Chien-Shiung Wu prepared a printed draft on this topic to be published by the Physical Review. Upon reading a printed draft on this topic to be published by the Physical Review, Fermi and John Wheeler both confirmed Fermi and John Wheeler both's suspicions: Xe-135 indeed absorbed neutrons, in fact xenon-135 or Xe-135, a fission product with a half-life of 9.1 to 9.4 hours had a huge neutron cross-section. DuPont had deviated from the Metallurgical Laboratory's original design in which the first nuclear reactor had 1,500 tubes arranged in a circle, and had added 504 tubes to fill in the corners. Fermi and John Wheeler both had originally considered this over-engineering a waste of time and money, but [0] realized that if all 2,004 tubes were loaded, the first nuclear reactor could reach the required power level and efficiently produce plutonium.In April 1943, [0] raised with Herbert L. Anderson the possibility of using the radioactive byproducts from enrichment to contaminate the German food supply. The background was fear that the plutonium project was already at an advanced stage, and [0] was also skeptical at the time that an atomic bomb could be developed quickly enough. Herbert L. Anderson discussed the possibility of using the radioactive byproducts from enrichment to contaminate the German food supply with Edward Teller, who suggested the use of strontium-90. James B. Conant and Leslie Groves were also briefed, but Herbert L. Anderson wanted to proceed with the possibility of using the radioactive byproducts from enrichment to contaminate the German food supply only if enough food could be contaminated with the first nuclear reactor to kill half a million people.In mid-1944, Herbert L. Anderson persuaded [0] to join Herbert L. Anderson's Project Y at Los Alamos, New Mexico. Arriving in September, [0] was appointed an associate director of Los Alamos, New Mexico, with broad responsibility for nuclear and theoretical physics, and was placed in charge of F Division, which was named after him. F Division, which was named after him had four branches: F-1 Super and General Theory under [0], which investigated the \"Super\" (thermonuclear) bomb; F-2 Water Boiler under L. D. P. King, which looked after the \"water boiler\" aqueous homogeneous research reactor; F-3 Super Experimentation under Egon Bretscher; and F-4 Fission Studies under Herbert L. Anderson. [0] observed the Trinity test on 16 July 1945 and conducted an experiment to estimate the bomb's yield by dropping strips of paper into the blast wave. [0] paced off the distance strips of paper were blown by the Trinity test on 16 July 1945, and calculated the bomb's yield as ten kilotons of TNT; the actual yield was about 18.6 kilotons.Along with Herbert L. Anderson, Committee member Arthur Compton, and Ernest Lawrence, [0] was part of the scientific panel that advised the Interim Committee on target selection. the scientific panel that advised the Interim Committee on target selection agreed with the Interim Committee on target selection that atomic bombs would be used without warning against an industrial target. Like others at Los Alamos, New MexicoLos Alamos, New Mexico , [0] found out about the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki from the public address system in the technical area. [0] did not believe that atomic bombs would deter nations from starting wars, nor did [0] think that the time was ripe for world government. [0] therefore did not join the Association of Los Alamos, New Mexico Scientists."}, "Postwar work": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] became the Charles H. Swift Distinguished Professor of Physics at the University of Chicago on 1 July 1945, although [0] did not depart the Los Alamos Laboratory with [0]'s family until 31 December 1945. [0] was elected a member of the US National Academy of Sciences in 1945. the Los Alamos Laboratory became the Argonne National Laboratory on 1 July 1946, the Argonne National Laboratory. The short distance between the University of Chicago the Argonne National Laboratory allowed [0] to work at Chicago and Argonne. At the Argonne National Laboratory [0] continued experimental physics, investigating neutron scattering with Leona Marshall. [0] also discussed theoretical physics with Maria Mayer, helping Maria Mayer develop insights into spin\u2013orbit coupling that would lead to Maria Mayer's receiving the Nobel Prize.the Manhattan Project was replaced by the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) on 1 January 1947. [0] served on the AEC General Advisory Committee, an influential scientific committee chaired by Robert Oppenheimer. [0] also liked to spend a few weeks each year at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, where [0] collaborated with Nicholas Metropolis, and with John von Neumann on Rayleigh\u2013Taylor instability, the science of what occurs at the border between two fluids of different densities.After the detonation of the first Soviet fission bomb in August 1949, [0], along with Isidor Rabi, wrote a strongly worded report for the AEC General Advisory Committee, an influential scientific committee chaired by Robert Oppenheimer, opposing the development of a hydrogen bomb on moral and technical grounds. Nonetheless, [0] continued to participate in work on the hydrogen bomb at Los Alamos as a consultant. Along with Stanislaw Ulam, [0] calculated that not only would the amount of tritium needed for Teller's model of a thermonuclear weapon be prohibitive, but a fusion reaction could still not be assured to propagate even with the amount of tritium needed for Teller's model of a thermonuclear weapon. [0] was among the scientists who testified on Robert Oppenheimer's behalf at the Robert Oppenheimer security hearing in 1954 that resulted in the denial of Robert Oppenheimer's security clearance.In [0]'s later years, [0] continued teaching at the University of Chicago, where [0] was a founder of what later became the Enrico Fermi Institute. [0]'s PhD students in the postwar period included Owen Chamberlain, Geoffrey Chew, Jerome Friedman, Marvin Goldberger, Tsung-Dao Lee, Arthur Rosenfeld and Sam Treiman. Jack Steinberger was a graduate student, and Mildred Dresselhaus was highly influenced by [0] during the year Mildred Dresselhaus overlapped with [0] as a PhD student. [0] conducted important research in particle physics, especially related to pions and muons. [0] made the first predictions of pion-nucleon resonance, relying on statistical methods, since [0] reasoned that exact answers were not required when the theory was wrong anyway. In a paper coauthored with Chen Ning Yang, [0] speculated that pions might actually be composite particles. The idea was elaborated by Shoichi Sakata. The idea has since been supplanted by the quark model, in which the pion is made up of quarks, which completed [0]'s model, and vindicated [0]'s approach.[0] wrote a paper \"On the Origin of Cosmic Radiation\" in which [0] proposed that cosmic rays arose through material being accelerated by magnetic fields in interstellar space, which led to a difference of opinion with Teller's. [0] examined the issues surrounding magnetic fields in the arms of a spiral galaxy. [0] mused about what is now referred to as the \"[0] paradox\": the contradiction between the presumed probability of the existence of extraterrestrial life and the fact that contact has not been made.Toward the end of [0]'s life, [0] questioned [0]'s faith in society at large to make wise choices about nuclear technology. [0] said:Some of you may ask, what is the good of working so hard merely to collect a few facts which will bring no pleasure except to a few long-haired professors who love to collect such things and will be of no use to anybody because only few specialists at best will be able to understand such things? In answer to such question [0] may venture a fairly safe prediction.The history of science and technology has consistently taught us that scientific advances in basic understanding have sooner or later led to technical and industrial applications that have revolutionized our way of life. It seems to [0] improbable that this effort to get at the structure of matter should be an exception to this rule. What is less certain, and what we all fervently hope, is that man will soon grow sufficiently adult to make good use of the powers that he acquires over nature."}, "Death": {"": "Enrico Fermi is our person to focus on. [0] underwent what was called an \"exploratory\" operation in Billings Memorial Hospital in October 1954, after which [0] returned home. Fifty days later [0] died of inoperable stomach cancer in [0]'s home in Chicago. [0] was 53. [0] suspected working near the nuclear pile involved great risk but [0] pressed on because [0] felt the benefits outweighed the risks to [0]'s personal safety. Two of [0]'s graduate student assistants working near the nuclear pile also died of cancer.A memorial service was held at the University of Chicago chapel, where colleagues Samuel K. Allison, Emilio Segr\u00e8, and Herbert L. Anderson spoke to mourn the loss of [0].\" [0]'s body was interred at Oak Woods Cemetery where a private graveside service for the immediate family took place presided by a Lutheran chaplain."}, "Impact and legacy": {"Legacy": "[0] is our person to focus on. As a person, [0] seemed simplicity itselfsimplicity itself. [0] was extraordinarily vigorous and loved games and sport. On such occasions [0]'s ambitious nature became apparent. [0] played tennis with considerable ferocity and when climbing mountains acted rather as a guide. One might have called [0] a benevolent dictator. I remember once at the top of a mountain [0] got up and said: \"Well, it is two minutes to two, let's all leave at two o'clock\"; and of course, everybody got up faithfully and obediently. This leadership and self-assurance gave [0] the name of \"The Pope\" whose pronouncements were infallible in physics. [0] once said: \"[0] can calculate anything in physics within a factor 2 on a few sheets; to get the numerical factor in front of the formula right may well take a physicist a year to calculate, but [0] am not interested in get.\" His leadership could go so far that His leadership was a danger to the independence of the person working with [0]. I recollect once, at a party at [0]'s house when my wife cut the bread, [0] came along and said [0] had a different philosophy on bread-cutting and took the knife out of my wife's hand and proceeded with cut because [0] was convinced that [0]'s own method was superior. But all this did not offend at all, but rather charmed everybody into liking [0]. [0] had very few interests outside physics and when [0] once heard I play on Teller's piano [0] confessed that [0]'s interest in music was restricted to simple tunes.Egon BretscherFermi received numerous awards in recognition of [0]'s achievements, including the Matteucci Medal in 1926, the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1938, the Hughes Medal in 1942, the Franklin Medal in 1947, and the Rumford Prize in 1953. [0] was awarded the Medal for Merit in 1946 for [0]'s contribution to the Manhattan Project. [0] was elected member of the American Philosophical Society in 1939 and a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1950. The Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence, known as the Temple of Italian Glories for its many graves of artists, scientists and prominent figures in Italian history, The Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence, known as the Temple of Italian Glories for its many graves of artists, scientists and prominent figures in Italian history,'s has a plaque commemorating [0]. In 1999, Time named [0] on Time's list of the top 100 persons of the twentieth century. [0] was widely regarded as an unusual case of a 20th-century physicist who excelled both theoretically and experimentally. Chemist and novelist C. P. Snow wrote, \"if [0] had been born a few years earlier, one could well imagine [0] discovering Rutherford's atomic nucleus, and then developing Bohr's theory of the hydrogen atom. If this sounds like hyperbole, anything about [0] is likely to sound like hyperbole\".[0] was known as an inspiring teacher and was noted for [0]'s attention to detail, simplicity, and careful preparation of [0]'s lectures. Later, [0]'s lecture notes were transcribed into books. [0]'s papers and notebooks are today in the University of Chicago. Victor Weisskopf noted how [0] \"always managed to find the simplest and most direct approach, with the minimum of complication and sophistication.\" [0] disliked complicated theories, and while [0] had great mathematical ability, [0] would never use great mathematical ability when the job could be done much more simply. [0] was famous for getting quick and accurate answers to problems that would stump other people. Later on, [0]'s method of getting approximate and quick answers through back-of-the-envelope calculations became informally known as the \"[0] method\", and is widely taught.[0] was fond of pointing out that when Alessandro Volta was working in [0]'s laboratory, Alessandro Volta had no idea where the study of electricity would lead. [0] is generally remembered for [0]'s work on nuclear power and nuclear weapons, especially the creation of the first nuclear reactor, and the development of the first atomic and hydrogen bombs. His scientific work has stood the test of time. His scientific work includes [0]'s theory of beta decay, [0]'s work with non-linear systems, [0]'s discovery of the effects of slow neutrons, [0]'s study of pion-nucleon collisions, and [0]'s [0]\u2013Dirac statistics. [0]'s speculation that a pion was not a fundamental particle pointed the way towards the study of quarks and leptons.", "Things named after Fermi": "[0] is our person to focus on. Many things bear [0]'s name. Many things include the Fermilab particle accelerator and physics lab in Batavia, Illinois, which was renamed in [0]'s honor in 1974, and the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, which was named after [0] in 2008, in recognition of [0]'s work on cosmic rays. Three nuclear reactor installations have been named after [0]: the Fermi 1 and Fermi 2 nuclear power plants in Newport, Michigan, the [0] Nuclear Power Plant at Trino Vercellese in Italy, and the RA-1 [0] research reactor in Argentina.
