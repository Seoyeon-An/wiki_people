Due to his own campaign, [0]'s name recognition in the Hudson Valley, and the Democratic landslide in the 1910 elections, [0] won a surprising victory.Despite short legislative sessions, [0] treated a seat in the state senate as a full-time career. Taking [0]'s seat on January 1, 1911, [0] soon became the leader of a group of \"Insurgents\" in opposition to the Tammany Hall machine that dominated the state Democratic Party.

Though [0] remained publicly supportive of Wilson, [0] sympathized with the Preparedness Movement, whose leaders strongly favored the Allied Powers and called for a military build-up. The Wilson administration initiated an expansion of the Navy after the sinking of the RMS Lusitania by a German submarine, and [0] helped establish the United States Navy Reserve and the Council of National Defense.

While the Roosevelts were vacationing at Campobello Island in August 1921, [0] fell ill. [0]'s main symptoms were fever; symmetric, ascending paralysis; facial paralysis; bowel and bladder dysfunction; numbness and hyperesthesia; and a descending pattern of recovery.

The chief opposition to [0]'s candidacy came from Northeastern conservatives, Speaker of the House John Nance Garner of Texas and Al Smith, the 1928 Democratic presidential nominee.[0] entered the convention with a delegate lead due to [0]'s success in the 1932 Democratic primaries, but most delegates entered the convention unbound to any particular candidate. On the first presidential ballot of the convention, [0] received the votes of more than half but less than two-thirds of the delegates, with Al Smith, the 1928 Democratic presidential nominee finishing in a distant second place. [0] then promised the vice-presidential nomination to Garner, who controlled the votes of Texas and California; Garner, who controlled the votes of Texas and California threw Garner, who controlled the votes of Texas and California's support behind [0] after the third ballot, and [0] clinched the 1932 Democratic presidential nomination on the fourth ballot. [0] flew in from New York to Chicago after learning that [0] had won the 1932 Democratic presidential nomination, becoming the first major-party presidential nominee to accept the 1932 Democratic presidential nomination in person. [0]'s appearance was essential, to show [0] as vigorous, despite the ravaging disease that disabled [0] physically.In [0]'s acceptance speech, [0] declared, \"[0] pledge you, [0] pledge [0] to a new deal for the American people... This is more than a political campaign. This is a call to arms.\" [0] promised securities regulation, tariff reduction, farm relief, government-funded public works, and other government actions to address the depression. Reflecting changing public opinion, the Democratic platform included a call for the repeal of Prohibition; [0] had not taken a public stand on the repeal of Prohibition prior to the convention but promised to uphold the Democratic platform. Otherwise, [0]'s primary campaign strategy was one of caution, intent upon avoiding mistakes that would distract from Hoover's's failings on the economy. [0]'s statements attacked Hoover's and included no other specific policies or programs.After the convention, [0] won endorsements from several progressive Republicans, including George W. Norris, Hiram Johnson, and Robert La Follette Jr. [0] also reconciled with the party's conservative wing, and Al Smith, the 1928 Democratic presidential nominee was persuaded to support the Democratic ticket. Hoover's's handling of the Bonus Army further damaged Hoover's's popularity, as newspapers across the country criticized the use of force to disperse assembled veterans.[0] won 57% of the popular vote and carried all but six states. Historians and political scientists consider the 1932 presidential election to be a political realignment. [0]'s victory was enabled by the creation of the New Deal coalition, small farmers, the Southern whites, Catholics, big city political machines, labor unions, northern African Americans (southern ones were still disfranchised), Jews, intellectuals, and political liberals. The creation of the New Deal coalition transformed American politics and started what political scientists call the \"New Deal Party System\" or the Fifth Party System. Between the Civil War and 1929, Democrats had rarely controlled both houses of Congress and had won just four of seventeen presidential elections; from 1932 to 1979, Democrats won eight of twelve presidential elections and generally controlled both houses of Congress.", "Transition and assassination attempt": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was elected in November 1932 but like [0]'s predecessors did not take office until the following March. After the election, President Hoover sought to convince [0] to renounce much of [0]'s campaign platform and to endorse the President Hoover administration's policies. [0] refused President Hoover's request to develop a joint program to stop the economic decline, claiming that a joint program to stop the economic decline would tie [0]'s hands and that President Hoover had the power to act.During the transition, [0] chose Howe as [0]'s chief of staff, and Farley as Postmaster General. Frances Perkins, as Secretary of Labor, became the first woman appointed to a cabinet position. William H. Woodin, a Republican industrialist close to [0], was the choice for Secretary of the Treasury, while [0] chose Senator Cordell Hull of Tennessee as Secretary of State. Harold L. Ickes and Henry A. Wallace, two progressive Republicans, were selected for the roles of Secretary of the Interior and Secretary of Agriculture, respectively.In February 1933, [0] escaped an assassination attempt by Giuseppe Zangara, who expressed a \"hate for all rulers.\" As Giuseppe Zangara, who expressed a \"hate for all rulers was attempting to shoot [0], Giuseppe Zangara, who expressed a \"hate for all rulers was struck by a woman with her pursea woman with her purse's ; Giuseppe Zangara, who expressed a \"hate for all rulers instead mortally wounded Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak, who was sitting alongside [0]."}, "Presidency (1933\u20131945)": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. As president, [0] appointed powerful men to top positions but made all the major decisions, regardless of delays, inefficiency, or resentment. Analyzing [0]'s administrative style, Burns concludes:[0] stayed in charge of [0]'s administration...by drawing fully on [0]'s formal and informal powers as Chief Executive; by raising goals, creating momentum, inspiring a personal loyalty, getting the best out of people...by deliberately fostering among [0]'s aides a sense of competition and a clash of wills that led to disarray, heartbreak, and anger but also set off pulses of executive energy and sparks of creativity...by handing out one job to several men and several jobs to one man, thus strengthening [0]'s own position as a court of appeals, as a depository of information, and as a tool of co-ordination; by ignoring or bypassing collective decision-making agencies, such as the Cabinet...and always by persuading, flattering, juggling, improvising, reshuffling, harmonizing, conciliating, manipulating. ", "First and second terms (1933\u20131941)": "[0] is our person to focus on. When [0] was inaugurated on March 4, 1933, the U.S. was at the nadir of the worst depression in the U.S.'s history. A quarter of the workforce was unemployed, and farmers were in deep trouble as prices had fallen by 60%. Industrial production had fallen by more than half since 1929. Two million people were homeless. By the evening of March 4, 1933, 32 of the 48 states\u2014as well as the District of Columbia\u2014had closed 32 of the 48 states\u2014as well as the District of Columbia\u2014's banks.Historians categorized [0]'s program as \"relief, recovery, and reform.\" Relief was urgently needed by tens of millions of unemployed. Recovery meant boosting the economy back to normal, and reform was required of the financial and banking systems. Through [0]'s series of 30 \"fireside chats\", [0] presented [0]'s directly to the American public as a series of radio addresses. Energized by [0]'s own victory over paralytic illness, [0] used persistent optimism and activism to renew the national spirit.On [0]'s second day in office, [0] declared a four-day national \"bank holiday\", to end the run by depositors seeking to withdraw funds. [0] called for a special session of Congress on March 9, when Congress passed, almost sight unseen, the Emergency Banking Act. the Emergency Banking Act gave [0] the power to determine the opening and closing of banks and authorized the Federal Reserve Banks to issue banknotes. The \"first 100 Days\" of Congress saw an unprecedented amount of legislation and set a benchmark against which future presidents have been compared. When the banks reopened on Monday, March 15, stock prices rose by 15 percent and in the following weeks over $1 billion was returned to bank vaults, ending the bank panic. On March 22, [0] signed the Cullen\u2013Harrison Act, which brought Prohibition to a close.[0] saw the establishment of a number of agencies and measures designed to provide relief for the unemployed and others. The Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA), under the leadership of Harry Hopkins, distributed relief to state governments. The Public Works Administration (PWA), under Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes, oversaw the construction of large-scale public works such as dams, bridges, and schools. The most popular of all New Deal agencies\u2014and [0]'s favorite\u2014was the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), which hired 250,000 unemployed men to work in rural projects. [0] also expanded Hoover's Reconstruction Finance Corporation, which financed railroads and industry. Congress gave the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) broad regulatory powers and provided mortgage relief to millions of farmers and homeowners. [0] also set up the Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA) to increase commodity prices, by paying farmers to leave land uncultivated and cut herds. In many instances, crops were plowed under and livestock killed, while many Americans died of hunger and were ill-clothed; critics labeled such policies \"utterly idiotic.\" On the positive side, nothing did more to rescue the farm family from isolation than the Rural Electrification Administration (REA), which brought electricity for the first time to millions of rural homes and with electricity such conveniences as radios and washing machines.\"Reform of the economy was the goal of the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) of 1933. the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) of 1933 sought to end cutthroat competition by forcing industries to establish rules such as minimum prices, agreements not to compete, and production restrictions. Industry leaders negotiated rules such as minimum prices, agreements not to compete, and production restrictions with the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) of 1933 officials, who suspended antitrust laws in return for better wages. The Supreme Court in May 1935 declared the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) of 1933 unconstitutional by a unanimous decision, to [0]'s chagrin. [0] reformed financial regulations with the Glass\u2013Steagall Act, creating the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to underwrite savings deposits. the Glass\u2013Steagall Act also limited affiliations between commercial banks and securities firms. In 1934, the Securities and Exchange Commission was created to regulate the trading of securities, while the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was established to regulate telecommunications.Recovery was sought through federal spending, as the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) of 1933 included $3.3\u00a0 billion (equivalent to $74.6\u00a0billion in 2022) of spending through the Public Works Administration. [0] worked with Senator Norris to create the largest government-owned industrial enterprise in American history\u2014the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA)\u2014which built dams and power stations, controlled floods, and modernized agriculture and home conditions in the poverty-stricken Tennessee Valley. However, natives criticized the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA)\u2014which built dams and power stations, controlled floods, and modernized agriculture and home conditions in the poverty-stricken Tennessee Valley for displacing thousands of people for these projects. The Soil Conservation Service trained farmers in the proper methods of cultivation, and with the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA)\u2014which built dams and power stations, controlled floods, and modernized agriculture and home conditions in the poverty-stricken Tennessee Valley, [0] became the father of soil conservation. Executive Order 6102 declared that all privately held gold of American citizens was to be sold to the U.S. Treasury and the price raised from $20 to $35 per ounce. The goal was to counter the deflation which was paralyzing the economy.[0] tried to keep [0]'s campaign promise by cutting the federal budget. cutting included a reduction in military spending from $752\u00a0 million in 1932 to $531\u00a0 million in 1934 and a 40% cut in spending on veterans benefits. 500,000 veterans and widows were removed from the pension rolls, and benefits were reduced for the remainder. Federal salaries were cut and spending on research and education was reduced. The veterans were well organized and strongly protested, so most benefits were restored or increased by 1934. Veterans groups such as the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars won Veterans groups such as the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars's campaign to transform Veterans groups such as the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars's benefits from payments due in 1945 to immediate cash when Congress overrode [0]'s veto and passed the Bonus Act in January 1936. the Bonus Act pumped sums equal to 2% of the GDP into the consumer economy and had a major stimulus effect.[0] expected that [0]'s would lose seats in the 1934 Congressional elections, as his party had done in most previous midterm elections. Unexpectedly his party picked up seats in both houses of Congress. Empowered by the public's vote of confidence, the first item on [0]'s agenda in Congress was the creation of a social insurance program. The Social Security Act established Social Security and promised economic security for the elderly, the poor, and the sick. [0] insisted that Social Security should be funded by payroll taxes rather than from the general fund, saying, \"We put those payroll contributions there so as to give the contributors a legal, moral, and political right to collect the contributors's pensions and unemployment benefits. With payroll taxes in there, no damn politician can ever scrap a social insurance program.\" Compared with the social security systems in western European countries, The Social Security Act was rather conservative. But for the first time, the U.S. took responsibility for the economic security of the aged, the temporarily unemployed, dependent children, and disabled people. Against [0]'s original intention for universal coverage, The Social Security Act excluded farmers, domestic workers, and other groups, which made up about forty percent of the labor force.[0] consolidated the various relief organizations, though some, like The Public Works Administration (PWA), under Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes,, continued to exist. After winning Congressional authorization for further funding of relief efforts, [0] established the Works Progress Administration (WPA). Under the leadership of Harry Hopkins, the Works Progress Administration (WPA) employed over three million people in the Works Progress Administration (WPA)'s first year of operations. the Works Progress Administration (WPA) undertook numerous massive construction projects in cooperation with local governments. the Works Progress Administration (WPA) also set up the National Youth Administration and arts organizations.The National Labor Relations Act guaranteed workers the right to collective bargaining through unions of workers's own choice. The National Labor Relations Act also established the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to facilitate wage agreements and suppress repeated labor disturbances. The National Labor Relations Act did not compel employers to reach an agreement with employers's employees, but The National Labor Relations Act opened possibilities for American labor. The result was a tremendous growth of membership in the labor unions, especially in the mass-production sector. When the Flint sit-down strike threatened the production of General Motors, [0] broke with the precedent set by many former presidents and refused to intervene; the Flint sit-down strike ultimately led to the unionization of both General Motors and General Motors's rivals in the American automobile industry.While the First New Deal of 1933 had broad support from most sectors, the Second New Deal challenged the business community. Conservative Democrats, led by Al Smith, fought back with the American Liberty League, savagely attacking [0] and equating [0] with socialism. But Al Smith overplayed Al Smith's hand, and Al Smith's boisterous rhetoric let [0] isolate [0]'s and identify his opponents with the wealthy vested interests that opposed the Second New Deal, strengthening [0] for the 1936 landslide. By contrast, labor unions, energized by labor legislation, signed up millions of new members and became a major backer of [0]'s re-elections in 1936, 1940, and 1944.Burns suggests that [0]'s policy decisions were guided more by pragmatism than ideology and that [0] \"was like the general of a guerrilla army whose columns, fighting blindly in the mountains through dense ravines and thickets, suddenly converge, half by plan and half by coincidence, and debouch into the plain below.\" [0] argued that such apparently haphazard methodology was necessary. \"the U.S. needs and, unless [0] mistake the U.S.'s temper, the U.S. demands bold, persistent experimentation,\" [0] wrote. \"It is common sense to take a method and try a method; if a method fails, admit fails frankly and try another. But above all, try something.\"Eight million workers remained unemployed in 1936, and though economic conditions had improved since 1932, economic conditions remained sluggish. By 1936, [0] had lost the backing [0] once held in the business community because of [0]'s support for the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and The Social Security Act. The Republicans had few alternative candidates and nominated Kansas Governor Alf Landon, a little-known bland candidate whose chances were damaged by the public re-emergence of the still-unpopular Herbert Hoover. While [0] campaigned on a social insurance program the Second New Deal and continued to attack Hoover, Kansas Governor Alf Landon, a little-known bland candidate whose chances were damaged by the public re-emergence of the still-unpopular Herbert Hoover sought to win voters who approved of the goals of the Second New Deal but disagreed with the Second New Deal's implementation.An attempt by Louisiana Senator Huey Long to organize a left-wing third party collapsed after Louisiana Senator Huey Long's assassination in 1935. The remnants, helped by Father Charles Coughlin, supported William Lemke of the newly formed Union Party. [0] won re-nomination with little opposition at the 1936 Democratic National Convention, while [0]'s allies overcame Southern resistance to permanently abolish the long-established rule that had required Democratic presidential candidates to win the votes of two-thirds of the delegates rather than a simple majority.In the election against Landon and a third-party candidateKansas Governor Alf Landon, a little-known bland candidate whose chances were damaged by the public re-emergence of the still-unpopular Herbert Hoover , [0] won 60.8% of the vote and carried every state except Maine and Vermont. The Democratic ticket won the highest proportion of the popular vote. Democrats also expanded Democrats's majorities in Congress, winning control of over three-quarters of the seats in each house. the election against Landon and a third-party candidate also saw the consolidation of the the Second New Deal coalition; while his party lost some of his party's traditional allies in big business, his party were replaced by groups such as organized labor and African Americans, the latter of whom voted Democratic for the first time since the Civil War. [0] lost high-income voters, especially businessmen and professionals, but made major gains among the poor and minorities. [0] won 86 percent of the Jewish vote, 81 percent of Catholics, 80 percent of union members, 76 percent of Southerners, 76 percent of blacks in northern cities, and 75 percent of people on relief. [0] carried 102 of the U.S.'s 106 cities with a population of 100,000 or more.The Supreme Court became [0]'s primary domestic focus during [0]'s second term after The Supreme Court overturned many of [0]'s programs, including the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) of 1933. The more conservative members of The Supreme Court upheld the principles of the Lochner era, which saw numerous economic regulations struck down on the basis of freedom of contract. [0] proposed the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937, which would have allowed him to appoint an additional Justice for each incumbent Justice over the age of 70; in 1937, there were six The Supreme Court Justices over the age of 70. The size of The Supreme Court had been set at nine since the passage of the Judiciary Act of 1869, and Congress had altered the number of Justices six other times throughout U.S. history. Roosevelt's \"court packing\" plan ran into intense political opposition from [0]'s own party, led by Vice President Garner since Roosevelt's \"court packing\" plan upset the separation of powers. A bipartisan coalition of liberals and conservatives of both parties opposed the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937, which would have allowed him to appoint an additional Justice for each incumbent Justice over the age of 70, and Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes broke with precedent by publicly advocating the defeat of the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937, which would have allowed him to appoint an additional Justice for each incumbent Justice over the age of 70. Any chance of passing the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937, which would have allowed him to appoint an additional Justice for each incumbent Justice over the age of 70 ended with the death of Senate Majority Leader Joseph Taylor Robinson in July 1937.Starting with the 1937 case of West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, The Supreme Court began to take a more favorable view of economic regulations. Historians have described take as, \"the switch in time that saved nine.\" 1937, [0] appointed a The Supreme Court Justice for the first time, and by 1941, seven of the nine Justices had been appointed by [0]. After the 1937 case of West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, The Supreme Court shifted The Supreme Court's focus from judicial review of economic regulations to the protection of civil liberties. Four of [0]'s The Supreme Court appointees, Felix Frankfurter, Robert H. Jackson,Hugo Black, and William O. Douglas, were particularly influential in reshaping the jurisprudence of The Supreme Court.With [0]'s influence on the wane following the failure of the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937, which would have allowed him to appoint an additional Justice for each incumbent Justice over the age of 70, conservative Democrats joined with Republicans to block the implementation of further New Deal programs. [0] did manage to pass some legislation, including the Housing Act of 1937, a second Agricultural Adjustment Act, and the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) of 1938, which was the last major piece of New Deal legislation. The Social Security Act outlawed child labor, established a federal minimum wage, and required overtime pay for certain employees who work in excess of forty-hours per week. [0] also won passage of the Reorganization Act of 1939 and subsequently created the Executive Office of the President, making the Executive Office of the President \"the nerve center of the federal administrative system.\" When the economy began to deteriorate again in mid-1937, during the onset of the recession of 1937\u20131938, [0] launched a rhetorical campaign against big business and monopoly power in the U.S., alleging that the bank panic was the result of a capital strike and even ordering the Federal Bureau of Investigation to look for a criminal conspiracy (of which the Federal Bureau of Investigation found none). [0] then asked Congress for $5\u00a0billion (equivalent to $101.78\u00a0billion in 2022) in relief and public works funding. This managed to eventually create as many as 3.3\u00a0million WPA jobs by 1938. Projects accomplished under WPA ranged from new federal courthouses and post offices to facilities and infrastructure for national parks, bridges, and other infrastructure across the U.S., and architectural surveys and archaeological excavations\u2014investments to construct facilities and preserve important resources. Beyond this, however, [0] recommended to a special congressional session only a permanent national farm act, administrative reorganization, and regional planning measures, all of which were leftovers from a regular session. According to 1944.Burns, asked illustrated [0]'s inability to settle on a basic economic program.Determined to overcome the opposition of conservative Democrats in Congress, [0] became involved in the 1938 Democratic primaries, actively campaigning for challengers who were more supportive of New Deal reform. [0] failed badly, managing to defeat only one of the ten targeted, a conservative Democrat from New York City. In the November 1938 elections, Democrats lost six Senate seats and 71 House seats, with losses concentrated among pro-New Deal reform Democrats. When Congress reconvened in 1939, Republicans under Senator Robert Taft formed a Conservative coalition with Southern Democrats, virtually ending [0]'s ability to enact [0]'s . Despite their's opposition to [0]'s domestic policies, many of their would provide crucial support for [0]'s foreign policy before and during World War II.Roosevelt had a lifelong interest in the environment and conservation starting with [0]'s youthful interest in forestry on [0]'s family estate. Although [0] was never an outdoorsman or sportsman on [0]'s scale, [0]'s growth of the financial and banking systems was comparable. When Felix Frankfurter was Governor of New York City, the Temporary Emergency Relief Administration was essentially a state-level predecessor of the federal Civilian Conservation Corps, with 10,000 or more men building fire trails, combating soil erosion and planting tree seedlings in marginal farmland in New York City. As President, [0] was active in expanding, funding, and promoting the financial and banking systems. the financial and banking systems's popularity soared, from three million visitors a year at the start of the decade to 15.5\u00a0million in 1939. the federal Civilian Conservation Corps enrolled 3.4\u00a0million young men and built 13,000 miles (21,000 kilometres) of trails, planted two billion trees, and upgraded 125,000 miles (201,000 kilometres) of dirt roads. Every state had its own state parks, and [0] made sure that WPA and CCC projects were set up to upgrade its own state parks as well as the financial and banking systems.Government spending increased from 8.0% of the gross national product (GNP) under Hoover in 1932 to 10.2% in 1936. The national debt as a percentage of the GNP had more than doubled under Hoover from 16% to 40% of the gross national product (GNP) in early 1933. The national debt as a percentage of the GNP held steady at close to 40% as late as fall 1941, then grew rapidly during the Civil War. the gross national product (GNP) was 34% higher in 1936 than in 1932 and 58% higher in 1940 on the eve of war. That is, the economy grew 58% from 1932 to 1940 in eight years of peacetime, and then grew 56% from 1940 to 1945 in five years of wartime. Unemployment fell dramatically during Roosevelt's first term. Unemployment increased in 1938 (\"a depression within a depression\") but continually declined after 1938. Total employment during Roosevelt's first term expanded by 18.31\u00a0million jobs, with an average annual increase in jobs during Roosevelt's first term of 5.3%.The main foreign policy initiative of Roosevelt's first term was the Good Neighbor Policy, which was a re-evaluation of U.S. policy toward Latin America. the U.S. frequently intervened in Latin America following the promulgation of the Monroe Doctrine in 1823, and the U.S. occupied several Latin American nations in the Banana Wars that occurred following the Spanish\u2013American War of 1898. After [0] took office, [0] withdrew U.S. forces from Haiti and reached new treaties with Cuba and Panama, ending Cuba and Panama's status as U.S. protectorates. In December 1933, [0] signed the Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States, renouncing the right to intervene unilaterally in the affairs of Latin American countries. [0] also normalized relations with the Soviet Union, which the U.S. had refused to recognize since the 1920s. [0] hoped to renegotiate the Russian debt from World War II.Roosevelt and open trade relations, but no progress was made on either issue and \"both nations were soon disillusioned by the Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States.\"The rejection of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919\u20131920 marked the dominance of isolationism in American foreign policy. Despite [0]'s Wilsonian background, he and Secretary of State Cordell Hull acted with great care not to provoke isolationist sentiment. The isolationist movement was bolstered in the early to mid-1930s by Senator Gerald Nye and others who succeeded in their effort to stop the \"merchants of death\" in the U.S. from selling arms abroadSenator Gerald Nye and others who succeeded in their effort to stop the \"merchants of death\" in the U.S. from selling arms abroad's . their effort to stop the \"merchants of death\" in the U.S. from selling arms abroad took the form of the Neutrality Acts; [0] was refused a provision [0] requested giving [0] the discretion to allow the sale of arms to victims of aggression. [0] largely acquiesced to Congress's non-interventionist policies in the early to mid-1930s. In the interim, Fascist Italy under Benito Mussolini proceeded to overcome Ethiopia, and the Italians joined Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler in supporting General Francisco Franco and the Nationalist cause in the Spanish Civil War. As the Spanish Civil War drew to a close in early 1939, [0] expressed regret in not aiding the Spanish Republicans. When Japan invaded China in 1937, isolationism limited [0]'s ability to aid China, despite atrocities like the Nanking Massacre and the USS Panay incident.Germany annexed Austria in 1938, and soon turned Germany's attention to Germany's eastern neighbors. [0] made it clear that, in the event of German aggression against Czechoslovakia, the U.S. the U.S. would remain neutral. After completion of the Munich Agreement and the execution of Kristallnacht, American public opinion turned against Germany, and [0] began preparing for a possible war with Germany. Relying on an interventionist political coalition of Southern Democrats and business-oriented Republicans, [0] oversaw the expansion of U.S. airpower and war production capacity.When World War II.Roosevelt began in September 1939 with Germany's invasion of Poland and Britain and France's's subsequent declaration of war upon Germany, [0] sought ways to assist Britain and France's militarily. Isolationist leaders like Charles Lindbergh and Senator William Borah successfully mobilized opposition to [0]'s proposed repeal of The Social Security Act, but [0] won Congressional approval of the sale of arms on a cash-and-carry basis. [0] also began a regular secret correspondence with Britain's First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill, in September 1939\u2014the first of 1,700 letters and telegrams between them. [0] forged a close personal relationship with Churchill, who became Prime Minister of the U.S. in May 1940.The Fall of France's in June 1940 shocked the American public, and isolationist sentiment declined. In July 1940, [0] appointed two interventionist Republican leaders, Henry L. Stimson and Frank Knox, as Secretaries of War and the Navy, respectively. both parties gave support to [0]'s plans for a rapid build-up of the American military, but the isolationists warned that [0] would get the U.S. into an unnecessary war with Germany. In July 1940, a group of Congressmen introduced a bill that would authorize the U.S.'s first peacetime draft, and with the support of Roosevelt's first term, the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 passed in September. The size of the army increased from 189,000 men at the end of 1939 to 1.4\u00a0million men in mid-1941. In September, [0] openly defied The Social Security Act by reaching the Destroyers for Bases Agreement, which, in exchange for military base rights in the British Caribbean Islands, gave 50 WWI American destroyers to Britain.While working under President Wilson, [0] had perpetuated ideas of American racial superiority by believing that the people of Latin America were uncapable of self-government. However, by 1938 [0] had switched [0]'s point of view, becoming an advocate for cooperation. In an effort to denounce past U.S. interventionism and subdue any subsequent fears of Latin Americans, [0] announced on March 4, 1933, during [0]'s inaugural address, \"In the field of World policy, [0] would dedicate the U.S. to the policy of the good neighbor, the neighbor who resolutely respects himself and, because he does so, respects the rights of othersthe neighbor who resolutely respects himself and, because he does so, respects the rights of others the neighbor who resolutely respects himself and, because he does so, respects the rights of others , the neighbor who respects his's obligations and respects the sanctity of his's agreements in and with a World of neighbors.\"In order to create a friendly relationship between the U.S. and Central as well as South American countries, [0] sought to abstain from asserting military force in the region. This position was affirmed by Cordell Hull, Roosevelt's Secretary of State at a conference of American states in Montevideo in December 1933. Cordell Hull, Roosevelt's Secretary of State said: \"No country has the right to intervene in the internal or external affairs of another.\" [0] then confirmed the policy in December of 1933: \"The definite policy of the U.S. from now on is one opposed to armed intervention.\" The fact that the policy was even put into place meant that the U.S. now recognised the maturity of Latin American countries and as a result were now more open to working together, especially when it comes to maintaining the peace. the policy, in the end, was yet another way for the U.S. to assert the U.S.'s own superiority.In the months prior to the July 1940 Democratic National Convention, there was much speculation as to whether [0] would run for an unprecedented third term. [0] was silent, and even [0]'s closest advisors were in the dark. The two-term tradition, although not yet enshrined in the Constitution, had been established by George Washington when George Washington refused to run for a third term in the 1796 presidential election. [0] refused to give a definitive statement as to [0]'s willingness to be a candidate again, and [0] even indicated to some ambitious Democrats, such as James Farley, that [0] would not run for a third term and that he and Secretary of State Cordell Hull could seek the Democratic nomination. James Farley and Vice President John Garner were not pleased with [0]'s decision to break from Washington's precedent. As Germany swept through Western Europe and menaced Britain in mid-1940, [0] decided that [0] had the necessary experience and skills to see the U.S. safely through the Nazi threat. [0] was aided by his party's political bosses, who feared that no Democrat except [0] could defeat Wendell Willkie, the popular Republican nominee.At the July 1940 Democratic Convention in Chicago, [0] easily swept aside challenges from James Farley and Vice President John Garner. To replace Vice President John Garner on the ticket, [0] turned to Secretary of Agriculture Henry Wallace of Iowa, a former Republican who strongly supported the New Deal and was popular in farm states. turned was strenuously opposed by many of his party's conservatives, who felt Secretary of Agriculture Henry Wallace of Iowa, a former Republican who strongly supported the New Deal and was popular in farm states was too radical and \"eccentric\" in Secretary of Agriculture Henry Wallace of Iowa, a former Republican who strongly supported the New Deal and was popular in farm states's private life to be an effective running mate. But [0] insisted that without Secretary of Agriculture Henry Wallace of Iowa, a former Republican who strongly supported the New Deal and was popular in farm states on the ticket [0] would decline re-nomination, and Secretary of Agriculture Henry Wallace of Iowa, a former Republican who strongly supported the New Deal and was popular in farm states won the vice-presidential nomination, defeating Speaker of the House William B. Bankhead and other candidates.A late August poll taken by Gallup found the race to be essentially tied, but [0]'s popularity surged in September following the announcement of the Second New Deal. Wendell Willkie, the popular Republican nominee supported much of the Second New Deal as well as rearmament and aid to Britain but warned that [0] would drag the U.S. into another European war. Responding to Wendell Willkie, the popular Republican nominee's attacks, [0] promised to keep the U.S. out of the Civil War. Over the election against Landon and a third-party candidate's last month, the election against Landon and a third-party candidate degenerated into a series of outrageous accusations and mud-slinging, if not by he and Secretary of State Cordell Hull then by he and Secretary of State Cordell Hull's . [0] won the 1940 election with 55% of the popular vote, 38 of the 48 states, and almost 85% of the electoral vote.", "Third and fourth terms (1941\u20131945)": "[0] is our person to focus on. World War II dominated [0]'s attention, with far more time devoted to world affairs than ever before. Domestic politics and relations with Congress were largely shaped by [0]'s efforts to achieve total mobilization of the nation's's economic, financial, and institutional resources for the war effort. Even relationships with Latin America and Canada were structured by wartime demands. [0] maintained close personal control of all major diplomatic and military decisions, working closely with [0]'s generals and admirals, the war and Navy departments, the British, and even the Soviet Union. [0]'s key advisors on diplomacy were Harry Hopkins (who was based in the White House), Sumner Welles (based in the State Department), and Henry Morgenthau Jr. at Treasury. In military affairs, [0] worked most closely with Secretary Henry L. Stimson at the War Department, Army Chief of Staff George Marshall, and Admiral William D. Leahy.By late 1940, re-armament was in high gear, partly to expand and re-equip the Army and Navy and partly to become the \"Arsenal of Democracy\" for Britain and other countries. With [0]'s Four Freedoms speech in January 1941, [0] laid out the case for an Allied battle for basic rights throughout the world. Assisted by Willkie, [0] won Congressional approval of the Lend-Lease program, which directed massive military and economic aid to Britain, and China. In sharp contrast to the loans of World War I, there would be no repayment after World War II. As [0] took a firmer stance against Japan, Germany, and Italy, American isolationists such as Charles Lindbergh and the America First Committee vehemently attacked [0] as an irresponsible warmonger. When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, [0] agreed to extend Lend-Lease to the Soviets. Thus, [0] had committed the nation's to the Allied side with a policy of \"all aid short of war.\" By July 1941, [0] authorized the creation of the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs (OCIAA) to counter perceived propaganda efforts in Latin America by Germany and Italy.In August 1941, Roosevelt and Churchill conducted a highly secret bilateral meeting in which they drafted the Atlantic Charter, conceptually outlining global wartime and postwar goals. a highly secret bilateral meeting in which they drafted the Atlantic Charter, conceptually outlining global wartime and postwar goals would be the first of several wartime conferences; Roosevelt and Churchill would meet ten more times in person. Though Churchill pressed for an American declaration of war against Germany, [0] believed that Congress would reject any attempt to bring the nation's into World War II. In September, a German submarine fired on the U.S. destroyer Greer, and [0] declared that the U.S. Navy would assume an escort role for Allied convoys in the Atlantic as far east as Great Britain and would fire upon German ships or submarines (U-boats) of the Kriegsmarine if German ships or submarines (U-boats) of the Kriegsmarine entered the the U.S. Navy zone. According to historian George Donelson Moss, [0] \"misled\" Americans by reporting fired the U.S. destroyer Greer as if fired would have been an unprovoked German attack on a peaceful American ship. fire effectively declared naval war on Germany and was favored by Americans by a margin of 2-to-1.After the German invasion of Poland, the primary concern of both [0] and [0]'s top military staff was on the war in Europe, but Japan also presented foreign policy challenges. Relations with Japan had continually deteriorated since Japan's invasion of Manchuria in 1931, and Relations with Japan had further worsened with [0]'s support of China. With the war in Europe occupying the attention of the major colonial powers, Japanese leaders eyed vulnerable colonies such as the Dutch East Indies, French Indochina, and British Malaya. After [0] announced a $100\u00a0million loan (equivalent to $2.1\u00a0billion in 2022) to China in reaction to Japan's occupation of French Indochina, Japan signed the Tripartite Pact with Germany and Italy. the Tripartite Pact bound each country to defend the others against attack, and Germany, Japan, and Italy became known as the Axis powers. Overcoming those who favored invading the Soviet Union, the Japanese Army high command successfully advocated for the conquest of Southeast Asia to ensure continued access to raw materials. In July 1941, after Japan occupied the remainder of French Indochina, [0] cut off the sale of oil to Japan, depriving Japan of more than 95 percent of Japan's oil supply. [0] also placed the Philippine military under American command and reinstated General Douglas MacArthur into active duty to command U.S. forces in the Philippine military.The Japanese were incensed by the Tripartite Pact and Japanese leaders became determined to attack the nation's unless the nation's lifted the Tripartite Pact. The Roosevelt administration was unwilling to reverse fire, and Secretary of State Hull blocked a potential summit between [0] and Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe. After diplomatic efforts to end the Tripartite Pact failed, the Privy Council of Japan authorized a strike against the nation's. The Japanese believed that the destruction of the the nation's Asiatic Fleet (stationed in the Philippine military) and the United States Pacific Fleet (stationed at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii) was vital to the conquest of Southeast Asia. On the morning of December 7, 1941, The Japanese struck the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii with struck, knocking out the main American battleship fleet and killing 2,403 American servicemen and civilians. At the same time, separate Japanese task forces attacked Thailand, British Hong Kong, the Philippine military, and other targets. [0] called for war in [0]'s \"Infamy Speech\" to Congress, in which [0] said: \"Yesterday, December 7, 1941\u2014a date which will live in infamy\u2014the nation's was suddenly and deliberately struck by naval and air forces of Japan.\" In a nearly unanimous vote, Congress declared war on Japan. After struckPearl Harbor in Hawaii, antiwar sentiment in the nation's largely evaporated overnight. On December 11, 1941, Hitler and Mussolini declared war on the nation's.A majority of scholars have rejected the conspiracy theories that [0], or any other high government officials, knew in advance about struckPearl Harbor in Hawaii. The Japanese had kept The Japanese's secrets closely guarded. Senior American officials were aware that war was imminent, but Senior American officials did not expect struckPearl Harbor in Hawaii. [0] had expected that The Japanese would attack either the Dutch East Indies or Thailand.  In late December 1941, Roosevelt and Churchill met at the Arcadia Conference, which established a joint strategy between the U.S. and Britain.the U.S. and Britain agreed on a Europe first strategy that prioritized the defeat of Germany before Japan. the U.S. and Britain established the Combined Chiefs of Staff to coordinate military policy and the Combined Munitions Assignments Board to coordinate the allocation of supplies. An agreement was also reached to establish a centralized command in the Pacific theater called ABDA, named for the American, British, Dutch, and Australian forces in the Pacific theater. On January 1, 1942, the nation's, Britain, China, the Soviet Union, and twenty-two other countries (the Allied Powers) issued the Declaration by United Nations, in which each nation pledged to defeat the Axis powers.In 1942, [0] formed a new body, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which made the final decisions on American military strategy. Admiral Ernest J. King as Chief of Naval Operations commanded the Navy and Marines, while Army Chief of Staff George Marshall led Army and was in nominal control of the Air Force, which in practice was commanded by General Hap Arnold. a new body, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which made the final decisions on American military strategy were chaired by Admiral William D. Leahy, the most senior officer in the military. [0] avoided micromanaging World War II and let [0]'s top military officers make most decisions. [0]'s civilian appointees handled the draft and procurement of men and equipment, but no civilians\u2014not even the secretaries of War or Navy\u2014had a voice in strategy. [0] avoided the State Department and conducted high-level diplomacy through [0]'s aides, especially Harry Hopkins, whose influence was bolstered by his control of the Lend Lease fundsHarry Hopkins, whose influence was bolstered by his control of the Lend Lease funds's .In August 1939, Leo Szilard and Albert Einstein sent the Einstein\u2013Szil\u00e1rd letter to [0], warning of the possibility of a German project to develop nuclear weapons. Leo Szilard realized that the recently discovered process of nuclear fission could be used to create a nuclear chain reaction that could be used as a weapon of mass destruction. [0] feared the consequences of allowing Germany to have sole possession of the technology and authorized preliminary research into nuclear weapons. After struckPearl Harbor in Hawaii, The Roosevelt administration secured the funds needed to continue research and selected General Leslie Groves to oversee the Manhattan Project, which was charged with developing the first nuclear weapons. Roosevelt and Churchill agreed to jointly pursue the Manhattan Project, which was charged with developing the first nuclear weapons, and [0] helped ensure that American scientists cooperated with American scientists's British counterparts.[0] coined the term \"Four Policemen\" to refer to the \"Big Four\" Allied powers of World War II, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and China. The \"Big Three\" of [0], Churchill, and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, together with Chinese Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, cooperated informally on a plan in which American and British troops concentrated in the West; Soviet troops fought on the Eastern front; and Chinese, British and American troops fought in Asia and the Pacific theater. the nation's also continued to send aid via the Lend-Lease program to the Soviet Union and other countries. the \"Big Four\" Allied powers of World War II, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and China formulated strategy in a series of high-profile conferences as well as by contact through diplomatic and military channels. Beginning in May 1942, the Soviets urged an Anglo-American invasion of German-occupied France in order to divert troops from the Eastern front. Concerned that Roosevelt and Churchill's forces were not yet ready for an invasion of German-occupied France, Roosevelt and Churchill decided to delay such an invasion until at least 1943 and instead focus on a landing in North Africa, known as Operation Torch.In November 1943, [0], Churchill, and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin met to discuss strategy and post-war plans at the Tehran Conference, where Roosevelt met Stalin for the first time. At the Tehran Conference, where Roosevelt met Stalin for the first time, Britain and the nation's committed to opening a second front against Germany in 1944, while Soviet leader Joseph Stalin committed to entering the war in Europe at an unspecified date. Subsequent conferences at Bretton Woods and Dumbarton Oaks established the framework for the post-war international monetary system and United Nations. Taking up the Wilsonian mantle, [0] pushed as [0]'s highest postwar priority the establishment of United Nations. [0] expected United Nations would be controlled by Washington, Moscow, London and Beijing, and would resolve all major world problems.Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin met for a second time at the February 1945 Yalta Conference in Crimea. With the end of the war in Europe approaching, [0]'s primary focus was on convincing Soviet leader Joseph Stalin to enter the war in Europe; a new body, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which made the final decisions on American military strategy had estimated that an American invasion of Japan would cause as many as one million American casualties. In return for the Soviet Union's entrance into the war in Europe, the Soviet Union was promised control of Asian territories such as Sakhalin Island. Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin agreed to hold a conference in 1945 to establish United Nations, and Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin also agreed on the structure of the United Nations Security Council, which would be charged with ensuring international peace and security. [0] did not push for the immediate evacuation of Soviet soldiers from Poland, but [0] won the issuance of the Declaration on Liberated Europe, which promised free elections in countries that had been occupied by Germany. Germany would not be dismembered but would be jointly occupied by the nation's, German-occupied France, Britain, and the Soviet Union. Against Soviet pressure, Roosevelt and Churchill refused to consent to impose huge reparations and deindustrialization on Germany after World War II. [0]'s role in the February 1945 Yalta Conference in Crimea has been controversial; critics charge that [0] naively trusted the Soviet Union to allow free elections in Eastern Europe, while supporters argue that there was little more that [0] could have done for Eastern Europe given the Soviet occupation and the need for cooperation with the Soviet Union during and after World War II.The Allies invaded French North Africa in November 1942, securing the surrender of Vichy French forces within days of landing. At the January 1943 Casablanca Conference, the \"Big Four\" Allied powers of World War II, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and China agreed to defeat Axis forces in North Africa and then launch an invasion of Sicily, with an attack on France to take place in 1944. At the January 1943 Casablanca Conference, [0] also announced that [0] would only accept the unconditional surrender of Germany, Japan, and Italy. In February 1943, the Soviet Union won a major victory at the Battle of Stalingrad, and in May 1943, the \"Big Four\" Allied powers of World War II, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and China secured the surrender of over 250,000 German and Italian soldiers in North Africa, ending the North Africa Campaign. the \"Big Four\" Allied powers of World War II, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and China launched an invasion of Sicily in July 1943, capturing Sicily by the end of the following month. In September 1943, the \"Big Four\" Allied powers of World War II, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and China secured an armistice from Italian Prime Minister Pietro Badoglio, but Germany quickly restored Mussolini to power. The Allied invasion of mainland Italy commenced in September 1943, but the Italian Campaign continued until 1945 as German and Italian troops resisted the Allied advance.To command an attack on France, [0] chose General Dwight D. Eisenhower, who had successfully commanded a multinational coalition in North Africa and Sicily. General Dwight D. Eisenhower, who had successfully commanded a multinational coalition in North Africa and Sicily chose to launch The Allied invasion of mainland Italy on June 6, 1944. Supported by 12,000 aircraft and the largest naval force ever assembled, the \"Big Four\" Allied powers of World War II, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and China successfully established a beachhead in Normandy and then advanced further into German-occupied France. Though reluctant to back an unelected government, [0] recognized Charles de Gaulle's Provisional Government of the French Republic as the de facto government of German-occupied France in July 1944. After most of German-occupied France had been liberated from German occupation, [0] granted formal recognition to Charles de Gaulle's Provisional Government of the French Republic in October 1944. Over the following months, the \"Big Four\" Allied powers of World War II, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and China liberated more territory from Nazi occupation and began the invasion of Germany. By April 1945, Nazi resistance was crumbling in the face of advances by both the \"Big Four\" Allied powers of World War II, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and China and the Soviet Union.In the opening weeks of World War II, Japan conquered the Philippine military and the British and Dutch colonies in Southeast Asia. The Japanese advance reached The Japanese advance's maximum extent by June 1942, when the U.S. Navy scored a decisive victory at the Battle of Midway. American and Australian forces then began a slow and costly strategy called island hopping or leapfrogging through the Pacific Islands, with the objective of gaining bases from which strategic airpower could be brought to bear on Japan and from which Japan could ultimately be invaded. In contrast to Hitler, [0] took no direct part in the tactical naval operations, though [0] approved strategic decisions. [0] gave way in part to insistent demands from the public and Congress that more effort be devoted against Japan, but [0] always insisted on Germany first. The strength of the U.S. Navy was decimated in the Battle of Leyte Gulf, and by April 1945 the Allies had re-captured much of the Allies's lost territory in the Pacific theater.The home front was subject to dynamic social changes throughout World War II, though domestic issues were no longer [0]'s most urgent policy concern. The military buildup spurred economic growth. Unemployment fell in half from 7.7\u00a0million in spring 1940 to 3.4\u00a0million in fall 1941 and fell in half again to 1.5\u00a0million in fall 1942, out of a labor force of 54\u00a0million. There was a growing labor shortage, accelerating the second wave of the Great Migration of African Americans, farmers and rural populations to manufacturing centers. African Americans from the South went to California and other West Coast states for new jobs in the defense industry. To pay for increased government spending, in 1941 [0] proposed that Congress enact an income tax rate of 99.5% on all income over $100,000; when proposed failed, [0] issued an executive order imposing an income tax of 100% on income over $25,000, which Congress rescinded. The Revenue Act of 1942 instituted top tax rates as high as 94% (after accounting for the excess profits tax), greatly increased the tax base, and instituted the first federal withholding tax. In 1944, [0] requested that Congress enact legislation which would tax all \"unreasonable\" profits, both corporate and individual, and thereby support [0]'s declared need for over $10\u00a0billion in revenue for World War II and other government measures. Congress overrode [0]'s veto to pass a smaller revenue bill raising $2\u00a0billion.In 1942, with the nation's now in World War II, war production increased dramatically but fell short of the goals established by the president, due in part to manpower shortages. war production was also hindered by numerous strikes, especially among union workers in the coal mining and railroad industries, which lasted well into 1944. Nonetheless, between 1941 and 1945, the nation's produced 2.4\u00a0million trucks, 300,000 military aircraft, 88,400 tanks, and 40\u00a0billion rounds of ammunition. The production capacity of the nation's dwarfed that of other countries; for example, in 1944, the nation's produced more military aircraft than the combined production of Germany, Japan, Britain, and the Soviet Union. the White House became the ultimate site for labor mediation, conciliation or arbitration. One particular battle royale occurred between Vice President Wallace, who headed the Board of Economic Warfare, and Jesse H. Jones, in charge of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation; both agencies assumed responsibility for the acquisition of rubber supplies and came to loggerheads over funding. [0] resolved the dispute by dissolving both agencies. In 1943, [0] established the Office of War Mobilization to oversee the home front; the Office of War Mobilization was led by James F. Byrnes, who came to be known as the \"assistant president\" due to his influenceJames F. Byrnes, who came to be known as the \"assistant president\" due to his influence's .[0]'s 1944 State of the Union Address advocated that Americans should think of basic economic rights as a Second Bill of Rights. [0] stated that all Americans should have the right to \"adequate medical care\", \"a good education\", \"a decent home\", and a \"useful and remunerative job\". In the most ambitious domestic proposal of [0]'s third term, [0] proposed the G.I. Bill, which would create a massive benefits program for returning soldiers. Benefits included post-secondary education, medical care, unemployment insurance, job counseling, and low-cost loans for homes and businesses. the G.I. Bill, which would create a massive benefits program for returning soldiers passed unanimously in Congress Congress and was signed into law in June 1944. Of the fifteen million Americans who served in World War II, more than half benefitted from the educational opportunities provided for in the G.I. Bill, which would create a massive benefits program for returning soldiers.[0] [0]'s had been in declining physical health since at least spring 1940. In March 1944, shortly after [0]'s 62nd birthday, [0] underwent testing at Bethesda Hospital and was found to have high blood pressure, atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease causing angina pectoris, and congestive heart failure.Hospital physicians and two outside specialists ordered [0] to rest. His personal physician, Admiral Ross McIntire, created a daily schedule that banned business guests for lunch and incorporated two hours of rest each day. During the 1944 re-election campaign, His personal physician, Admiral Ross McIntire, denied several times that declining physical health was poor; on October 12, for example, His personal physician, Admiral Ross McIntire, announced that \"declining physical health is perfectly OK. There are absolutely no organic difficulties at all.\" [0] realized that declining physical health could eventually make it impossible for [0] to continue as president, and in 1945 [0] told a confidant that [0] might resign from the presidency following the end of World War II.While some Democrats had opposed [0]'s nomination in spring 1940, [0] faced little difficulty in securing [0]'s re-nomination at the 1944 Democratic National Convention. [0] made it clear before the 1944 Democratic National Convention that [0] was seeking another term, and on the lone presidential ballot of the 1944 Democratic National Convention, [0] won the vast majority of delegates, although a minority of Southern Democrats voted for Harry F. Byrd. Party leaders prevailed upon [0] to drop Vice President Wallace from the ticket, believing Vice President Wallace to be an electoral liability and a poor potential successor in case of [0]'s death. [0] preferred Harry F. Byrd as Vice President Wallace's replacement but was convinced to support Senator Harry S. Truman of Missouri, who had earned renown for his investigation of war production inefficiency and was acceptable to the various factions of the partySenator Harry S. Truman of Missouri, who had earned renown for his investigation of war production inefficiency and was acceptable to the various factions of the party's . On the second vice presidential ballot of the 1944 Democratic National Convention, Senator Harry S. Truman of Missouri, who had earned renown for his investigation of war production inefficiency and was acceptable to the various factions of the party defeated Vice President Wallace to win the nomination.The Republicans nominated Thomas E. Dewey, the governor of New York, who had a reputation as a liberal in his party. The Republicans accused The Roosevelt administration of domestic corruption and bureaucratic inefficiency, but Thomas E. Dewey, the governor of New York, who had a reputation as a liberal in his party's most effective gambit was to raise discreetly the age issue. Thomas E. Dewey, the governor of New York, who had a reputation as a liberal in his party assailed [0] as a \"tired old man\" with \"tired old men\" in [0]'s cabinet, pointedly suggesting that [0]'s lack of vigor had produced a less than vigorous economic recovery. [0], as most observers could see from [0]'s weight loss and haggard appearance, was a tired man in 1944. But upon entering the 1944 re-election campaign in earnest in late September 1944, [0] displayed enough passion and fight to allay most concerns and to deflect Republican attacks. With World War II still raging, [0] urged voters not to \"change horses in mid-stream.\" Labor unions, which had grown rapidly in World War II, fully supported [0]. Roosevelt and Churchill Senator Harry S. Truman of Missouri, who had earned renown for his investigation of war production inefficiency and was acceptable to the various factions of the party won the 1944 election by a comfortable margin, defeating Thomas E. Dewey, the governor of New York, who had a reputation as a liberal in his party and Thomas E. Dewey, the governor of New York, who had a reputation as a liberal in his party's running mate John W. Bricker with 53.4% of the popular vote and 432 out of the 531 electoral votes. [0] campaigned in favor of a strong United Nations, so [0]'s victory symbolized support for the nation's's future participation in the international community.When [0] returned to the nation's from the February 1945 Yalta Conference in Crimea, many were shocked to see how old, thin and frail [0] looked. [0] spoke while seated in the well of the House, an unprecedented concession to [0]'s physical incapacity. During March 1945, [0] sent strongly worded messages to Soviet leader Joseph Stalin accusing Soviet leader Joseph Stalin of breaking Soviet leader Joseph Stalin's Yalta commitments over Poland, Germany, prisoners of war and other issues. When Soviet leader Joseph Stalin accused the western Allies of plotting behind Soviet leader Joseph Stalin's back a separate peace with Hitler, [0] replied: \"[0] cannot avoid a feeling of bitter resentment towards your informers, whoever they areyour informers, whoever they are , for such vile misrepresentations of [0]'s actions or those of [0]'s trusted subordinates.\" On March 29, 1945, [0] went to the Little White House at Warm Springs, Georgia, to rest before [0]'s anticipated appearance at the founding conference of the United Nations.[citation needed]In the afternoon of April 12, 1945, in Warm Springs, Georgia, while sitting for a portrait by Elizabeth Shoumatoff, [0] said: \"[0] have a terrific headache.\" [0] then slumped forward in [0]'s chair, unconscious, and was carried into [0]'s bedroom. [0]'s attending cardiologist, Howard Bruenn, diagnosed the medical emergency as a massive intracerebral hemorrhage. At 3:35\u00a0p.m. April 12, 1945, [0] died at the age of 63.The following morning, [0]'s body was placed in a flag-draped coffin and loaded onto the presidential train for the trip back to Washington. Along the route, thousands flocked to the tracks to pay thousands's respects. After a White House funeral on April 14, [0] was transported by train from Washington, D.C., to [0]'s place of birth at Hyde Park. On April 15 [0] was buried, per [0]'s wish, in the rose garden of [0]'s Springwood estate.declining physical health had been kept secret from the public. [0]'s was met with shock and grief across the world. Germany surrendered during the 30-day mourning period, but Senator Harry S. Truman of Missouri, who had earned renown for his investigation of war production inefficiency and was acceptable to the various factions of the party ordered flags to remain at half-staff; Senator Harry S. Truman of Missouri, who had earned renown for his investigation of war production inefficiency and was acceptable to the various factions of the party also dedicated Victory in Europe Day and Europe Day's celebrations to [0]'s memory. World War II finally ended with the signed surrender of Japan in September.Coincidentally, on April 12, 1945, a devastating tornado outbreak occurred in the nation's, which killed 128 people and injured over a thousand others. a devastating tornado outbreak included the fourth deadliest tornado in Oklahoma history, which leveled a third of the town of Antlers. [0]'s overshadowed what would have \"commanded national media attention\" for a while. Tornado expert Thomas P. Grazulis said that, \"even nearby newspapers had more information on died [0] than on the fourth deadliest tornado in Oklahoma history, which leveled a third of the town of Antlers\"."}, "Civil rights, repatriation, internment, and the Jews": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was viewed as a hero by many African Americans, Catholics, and Jews, and [0] was highly successful in attracting large majorities of many African Americans, Catholics, and Jews into [0]'s New Deal coalition. From [0]'s first term until 1939, the Mexican Repatriation started by President Herbert Hoover continued under [0], which scholars today contend was a form of ethnic cleansing towards Mexican Americans. [0] ended federal involvement in the Mexican Repatriation started by President Herbert Hoover. After 1934, the number of deportations fell by approximately 50 percent. However, [0] did not attempt to suppress the Mexican Repatriation started by President Herbert Hoover on a local or state level. Mexican Americans were the only group explicitly excluded from New Deal benefits. The deprival of due process for Mexican Americans is cited as a precedent for [0]'s internment of Japanese Americans in concentration camps during World War II. [0] won strong support from Chinese Americans and Filipino Americans, but not Japanese Americans, as [0] presided over Japanese Americans's internment during World War II. African Americans and Native Americans fared well in two New Deal relief programs, the Civilian Conservation Corps and the Indian Reorganization Act, respectively. Sitkoff reports that the Civilian Conservation Corps \"provided an economic floor for the whole black community in the 1930s, rivaling both agriculture and domestic service as the chief source\" of income.", "Lynching": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] stopped short of joining NAACP leaders in pushing for federal anti-lynching legislation, as [0] believed that federal anti-lynching legislation was unlikely to pass and that [0]'s support for federal anti-lynching legislation would alienate Southern congressmen. [0] did, however, appoint a \"Black Cabinet\" of African American advisers to advise on race relations and African American issues, and [0] publicly denounced lynching as \"murder\". First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt vocally supported efforts designed to aid the African American community, including the Fair Labor Standards Act, which helped boost wages for nonwhite workers in the South. In 1941, [0] established the Fair Employment Practices Committee (FEPC) to implement Executive Order 8802, which prohibited racial and religious discrimination in employment among defense contractors. the Fair Employment Practices Committee (FEPC) was the first national program directed against employment discrimination, and the Fair Employment Practices Committee (FEPC) played a major role in opening up new employment opportunities to non-white workers. During World War II, the proportion of African American men employed in manufacturing positions rose significantly. In response to [0]'s policies, African Americans increasingly defected from the Republican Party during the 1930s and 1940s, becoming an important Democratic voting bloc in several Northern states.", "Japanese-Americans": "Franklin D. Roosevelt is our person to focus on. The attack on Pearl Harbor raised concerns in the public regarding [0]. [0] was fed by long-standing racism against Japanese immigrants, as well as the findings of the Roberts Commission, which concluded that The attack on Pearl Harbor had been assisted by Japanese spies. On February 19, 1942, Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, which relocated 110,000 Japanese-American citizens and immigrants, most of whom lived on the Pacific Coast. 110,000 Japanese-American citizens and immigrants, most of whom lived on the Pacific Coast were forced to liquidate 110,000 Japanese-American citizens and immigrants, most of whom lived on the Pacific Coast's properties and businesses and interned in hastily built camps in interior, harsh locations. Distracted by other issues, Franklin D. Roosevelt had delegated the decision for internment to Secretary of War Stimson, who in turn relied on the judgment of Assistant Secretary of War John J. McCloy. The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Executive Order 9066, which relocated 110,000 Japanese-American citizens and immigrants, most of whom lived on the Pacific Coast in the 1944 case of Korematsu v. United States. Many German and Italian citizens were also arrested or placed into internment camps.", "Jews": "[0] is our person to focus on. There is controversy among historians about [0]'s attitude to Jews and the Holocaust. Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. says [0] \"did what [0] could do\" to help Jews; David Wyman says [0]'s record on Jewish refugees and Jewish refugees's rescue is \"very poor\" and one of the worst failures of [0]'s presidency. In 1923, as a member of the Harvard board of directors, [0] decided there were too many Jewish students at Harvard University and helped institute a quota to limit the number of Jews admitted to Harvard University. After Kristallnacht in 1938, [0] had [0]'s ambassador to Germany recalled back to Washington. [0] did not loosen immigration quotas but did allow German Jews already in the U.S. on visas to stay indefinitely. According to Rafael Medoff, [0] could have saved 190,000 Jewish lives by telling his State Department to fill immigration quotas to the legal limit, but [0]'s discouraged and disqualified Jewish refugees based on his administration's prohibitive requirements that left less than 25% of immigration quotas filled.Hitler chose to implement the \"Final Solution\"\u2014the extermination of the European Jewish population\u2014by January 1942, and American officials learned of the scale of the Nazi extermination campaign in the following months. Against the objections of his State Department, [0] convinced the other Allied leaders to jointly issue the Joint Declaration by Members of the United Nations, which condemned the Holocaust and warned to try the Holocaust's perpetrators as war criminals. In 1943, [0] told U.S. government officials that there should be limits on Jews in various professions to \"eliminate the specific and understandable complaints which the Germans bore towards the Jews in Germany.\" 1943, [0] was personally briefed by Polish Home Army intelligence agent Jan Karski who was an eyewitness of the Holocaust; pleading for action, Polish Home Army intelligence agent Jan Karski who was an eyewitness of the Holocaust told [0] that 1.8 million Jews had already been exterminated. Polish Home Army intelligence agent Jan Karski who was an eyewitness of the Holocaust recalled that in response, [0] \"did not ask one question about the Jews.\" In January 1944, [0] established the War Refugee Board to aid Jews and other victims of Axis atrocities. Aside from these actions, [0] believed that the best way to help the persecuted populations of Europe was to end the war as quickly as possible. Top military leaders and his State Department leaders rejected any campaign to bomb the extermination camps or the rail lines leading to the camps, fearing any campaign to bomb the extermination camps or the rail lines leading to the camps would be a diversion from the war effort. According to biographer Jean Edward Smith, there is no evidence that anyone ever proposed such a campaign to [0]."}, "Legacy": {"Historical reputation": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] is widely considered to be one of the most important figures in the history of the United States, as well as one of the most influential figures of the 20th century. Historians and political scientists consistently rank [0], George Washington, and Abraham Lincoln as the three greatest presidents, although the order varies. Reflecting on [0]'s presidency, \"which brought the United States through the Great Depression and World War II to a prosperous future\", biographer Jean Edward Smith said in 2007, \"[0] lifted [0] from a wheelchair to lift the United States from the United States's knees.[0]'s commitment to the working class and unemployed in need of relief in the United States's longest recession made [0] a favorite of the blue collar workers, labor unions, and ethnic minorities. The rapid expansion of government programs that occurred during [0]'s term redefined the role of the government in the United States, and [0]'s advocacy of government social programs was instrumental in redefining liberalism for coming generations. [0] firmly established the United States's leadership role on the world stage, with [0]'s role in shaping and financing World War II. [0]'s isolationist critics faded away, and even the Republicans joined in [0]'s overall policies. [0] also created a new understanding of the presidency, permanently increasing the power of the president at the expense of Congress.[0]'s Second Bill of Rights became, according to historian Joshua Zeitz, \"the basis of the Democratic Party's aspirations for the better part of four decades.\" After [0]'s , [0]'s widow, Eleanor, continued to be a forceful presence in U.S. and world politics, serving as delegate to the conference which established the United Nations and championing civil rights and liberalism generally. Some junior New Dealers played leading roles in the presidencies of Truman, John Kennedy, and Lyndon Johnson. John Kennedy came from a Roosevelt-hating family. Historian William Leuchtenburg says that before 1960, \"John Kennedy showed a conspicuous lack of inclination to identify John Kennedy as a New Deal liberal.\" Historian William Leuchtenburg adds, as president, \"John Kennedy never wholly embraced the Roosevelt tradition and at times John Kennedy deliberately severed John Kennedy from the Roosevelt tradition.\" By contrast, Lyndon Johnson had been an enthusiastic New Dealer and a favorite of [0]. Lyndon Johnson modelled his presidency on [0]'s and relied heavily on New Deal lawyer Abe Fortas, as well as James H. Rowe, Anna M. Rosenberg, Thomas Gardiner Corcoran, and Benjamin V. Cohen.During [0]'s , and continuing to a lesser extent afterwards, there has been much criticism of Roosevelt, some of much criticism of Roosevelt intense. Critics have questioned not only [0]'s policies, positions, and the consolidation of power that occurred due to [0]'s responses to the crises of the Great Depression and World War II but also [0]'s breaking with tradition by running for a third term as president. Long after [0]'s , new lines of attack criticized [0]'s policies regarding helping the Jews of Europe, incarcerating the Japanese on the West Coast, and opposing anti-lynching legislation.[0] was criticized by conservatives for [0]'s economic policies, especially the shift in tone from individualism to collectivism with the expansion of the welfare state and regulation of the economy. criticized continued decades after [0]'s . One factor in the revisiting of these issues in later decades was the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980, who opposed New Deal.", "Memorials": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0]'s home in Hyde Park is now a National Historic Site and home to [0]'s Presidential library. Washington, D.C., hosts two memorials to [0]. The largest, the 7+1\u20442-acre (3-hectare) [0] Memorial, is located next to the Jefferson Memorial on the Tidal Basin. A more modest memorial, a block of marble in front of the National Archives building suggested by [0], was erected in 1965. [0]'s leadership in the March of Dimes is one reason [0] is commemorated on the American dime. [0] has also appeared on several U.S. Postage stamps. On April 29, 1945, seventeen days after [0]'s death, the carrier USS Franklin D. Roosevelt was launched and served from 1945 to 1977. London's Westminster Abbey also has a stone tablet memorial to [0] that was unveiled by Attlee and Churchill in 1948. Welfare Island was renamed after [0] in September 1973.1948 statue of [0] in Grosvenor Square, LondonEngraving of the Four Freedoms at the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial, dedicated in 1997 in Washington, D.C.The obverse of the American dime", "": ""}}
