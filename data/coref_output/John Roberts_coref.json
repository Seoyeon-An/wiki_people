Classmate David B. Wilkins described [0] as \"more conservative than the typical Harvard University Law student in the 1970s\", though [0] had been well-liked among fellow students.

After graduating from law school, [0] was a law clerk for Judge Henry Friendly of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit from 1979 to 1980, then for Justice (later Chief Justice in 1986) William Rehnquist of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1980 to 1981.Following [0]'s clerkships, [0] began working for the U.S. government in the Administration of President Ronald Reagan, first from 1981 to 1982 as a special assistant to U.S. Attorney General William French Smith, then from 1982 to 1986 as an associate with the White House Counsel. [0] then entered private practice in Washington, D.C., as an associate at the law firm of Hogan & Hartson (now Hogan Lovells) and worked in the field of corporate law.In 1989, [0] joined the Administration of president George H. W. Bush as Principal Deputy Solicitor General. [0] served as the acting solicitor general for the case of Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC when the solicitor general, Ken Starr, had a conflict of interest. In the case of Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, [0] argued against policies of FCC intended to increase minority ownership of broadcast licenses, arguing that the racial preferences were unconstitutional. [0]'s decision to argue that a federal agency's policy was unconstitutional surprised many lawyers within the Solicitor General's office. In 1992, president George H. W. Bush nominated [0] to a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, but no Senate vote was held, and [0]'s expired at the end of the 102nd Congress.Following president George H. W. Bush's defeat by Bill Clinton in the 1992 presidential election, [0] left government service and returned to the law firm of Hogan & Hartson (now Hogan Lovells) as a partner. [0] became the head of the law firm of Hogan & Hartson (now Hogan Lovells)'s appellate practice, and also became an adjunct professor at the Georgetown University Law Center. During this time, [0] argued 39 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court, prevailing in 25 of 39 cases. [0] represented 19 states in United States v.

[0] was released to [0]'s mother three hours later. [0] sued, alleging that an adult would have only received a citation for violated, while children must be detained until parents are notified. The D.C. Circuit unanimously affirmed the district court's dismissal of [0]'s lawsuit, which was predicated on alleged violations of the Fourth Amendment (unreasonable search and seizure) and Fifth Amendment (equal protection).\"No one is very happy about the events that led to this litigation,\" John Roberts wrote. Because age discrimination is evaluated using a rational basis test, however, only weak state interests were required to justify the policy, and The D.C. Circuit concluded only weak state interests were present. \"Because parents and guardians play an essential role in that rehabilitative process, it is reasonable for the District to seek to ensure parents and guardians's participation, and the method chosen\u2014detention until the parent is notified and retrieves the child\u2014certainly does ensure, in a way issuing a citation might not.\" The D.C. Circuit concluded that the policy and detention were constitutional, noting that \"the question before The D.C. Circuit ... is not whether the policy and detention were a bad idea, but whether the policy and detention violated the Fourth and Fifth amendments to the Constitution,\" language reminiscent of Justice Potter Stewart's's dissent in Griswold v. Connecticut. \"We are not asked in this case to say whether We think the policy is unwise, or even asinine,\" Justice Potter Stewart's had written; \"Justice Potter Stewart's are asked to hold that the policy violates the Constitution.

[0] wrote a dissent in Rancho Viejo, LLC v. Norton, a case involving the protection of a rare California toad under the Endangered Species Act. When the court denied a rehearing en banc,(D.C. Cir. 2003) [0] dissented, arguing that the panel opinion was inconsistent with United States v. Lopez and United States v. Morrison in that the panel opinion incorrectly focused on whether the regulation substantially affects interstate commerce rather than on whether the regulated activity does. In [0]'s view, the Commerce Clause of the Constitution did not permit the government to regulate activity affecting what [0] called \"a hapless toad\" that \"for reasons of its's own, lives its's entire life in California.\" [0] said that reviewing the panel opinion would allow the court \"alternative grounds for sustaining application of the Endangered Species Act that may be more consistent with the court precedent.\""}, "Appointment to Supreme Court": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on.

Rehnquist died. Two days later, President Bush withdrew [0]'s and announced [0]'s new nomination as Chief Justice.", "Roberts's testimony on his jurisprudence": "[0] is our person to focus on. During his confirmation hearings, [0] said that [0] did not have a comprehensive jurisprudential philosophy, and [0] did \"not think beginning with an all-encompassing approach to constitutional interpretation is the best way to faithfully construe the document.\" [0] compared judges to baseball umpires: \"t's my job to call balls and strikes, and not to pitch or bat.\" Among the issues [0] discussed during his confirmation hearings were:In Senate hearings, [0] has stated:Starting with McCulloch v. Maryland, Chief Justice John Marshall gave a very broad and expansive reading to the powers of the Federal Government and explained generally that if the ends be legitimate, then any means chosen to achieve the ends are within the power of the Federal Government, and cases interpreting that, throughout the years, have come down. Certainly, by the time Lopez was decided, many of us had learned in law school that it was just sort of a formality to say that interstate commerce was affected and that cases weren't going to be thrown out that way. Lopez certainly breathed new life into the Commerce Clause.[0] think it remains to be seen, in subsequent decisions, how rigorous a showing, and in many cases, it is just a showing. It's not a question of an abstract fact, does this affect interstate commerce or not, but has this body, the Congress, demonstrated the impact on interstate commerce that drove them to legislate? the impact on interstate commerce that drove them to legislate's a very important factor. the impact on interstate commerce that drove them to legislate wasn't present in Lopez at all. [0] think the members of Congress this body, the Congress had heard the same thing [0] had heard in law school, that this is unimportant\u2014and the members of Congress hadn't gone through the process of establishing a record in Lopez. [0] stated the following about federalism in a 1999 radio interview:We have gotten to the point these days where we think the only way we can show we're serious about a problem is if we pass a federal law, whether a federal law is the Violence Against Women Act or anything else. The fact of the matter is conditions are different in different states, and state laws can be more relevant is [0] think exactly the right term, more attuned to the different situations in New York, as opposed to Minnesota, and that is what the Federal system is based on. At a Senate hearing, [0] stated:The Supreme Court has, throughout The Supreme Court's history, on many occasions described the deference that is due to legislative judgments. Justice Holmes described assessing the constitutionality of an act of this body, the Congress as the gravest duty that The Supreme Court is called upon to perform. ... It's a principle that is easily stated and needs to be observed in practice, as well as in theory.Now, The Supreme Court, of course, has the obligation, and has been recognized since Marbury v. Madison, to assess the constitutionality of acts of Congressthis body, the Congress, and when acts of Congress are challenged, it is the obligation of The Supreme Court to say what the law is. The determination of when deference to legislative policy judgments goes too far and becomes abdication of the judicial responsibility, and when scrutiny of legislative policy judgments goes too far on the part of the judges and becomes what Justice Holmes think is properly called judicial activism, that is certainly the central dilemma of having an unelected, as you describe it correctly, undemocratic judiciary in a democratic republic. On the subject of stare decisis, referring to Brown v. Board of Education, the decision overturning school segregation, [0] said that \"The Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education, the decision overturning school segregation, of course, overruled a prior decision. [0] don't think overruled constitutes judicial activism because obviously if the decision is wrong, the decision should be overruled. overruled's not activism. overruled's applying the law correctly.\"While working as a lawyer for the Reagan Administration, [0] wrote legal memos defending administration policies on abortion. At [0]'s nomination hearing [0] testified that legal memos defending administration policies on abortion represented the views of the administration [0] was representing at the time and not necessarily [0]'s own. \"Senator, [0] was a staff lawyer; [0] didn't have a position,\" [0] said. As a lawyer in the George H. W. Bush Administration, [0] signed a legal brief urging The Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade.In private meetings with senators before [0]'s confirmation, [0] testified that Roe v. Wade was settled law, but added that Roe v. Wade was subject to It, meaning that while The Supreme Court must give some weight to the precedent, The Supreme Court was not legally bound to uphold the precedent.In [0]'s Senate testimony, [0] said that, while sitting on the Appellate Court, [0] had an obligation to respect precedents established by The Supreme Court, including the right to an abortion. [0] stated: \"Roe v. Wade is the settled law of the land. ... There is nothing in [0]'s personal views that would prevent [0] from fully and faithfully applying that precedent, as well as Casey.\" Following the traditional reluctance of nominees to indicate which way nominees might vote on an issue likely to come before The Supreme Court, [0] did not explicitly say whether [0] would vote to overturn either. However, Jeffrey Rosen adds, \"Jeffrey Rosen wouldn't bet on [0]'s siding unequivocally with the anti-Roe v. Wade forces.\"", "Confirmation": "[0] is our person to focus on. On September 22, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved [0]'s nomination by a vote of 13\u20135, with Senators Ted Kennedy, Richard Durbin, Charles Schumer, Joe Biden and Dianne Feinstein voting against.

[0] took the Constitutional oath of office, administered by Associate Justice John Paul Stevens at the White House, on September 29, 2005. On October 3, [0] took the judicial oath provided for by the Judiciary Act of 1789 at the United States Supreme Court building.Justice Antonin Scalia said that [0] \"pretty much run the show the same way\" as Rehnquist, albeit \"let[ting] people go on a little longer at conference ... but [[0]'ll] get over let[ting.\" [0] has been portrayed as a consistent advocate for conservative principles by analysts such as Jeffrey Toobin. Garrett Epps has described [0]'s prose as \"crystalline, vivid, and often humorous\".Seventh Circuit judge Diane Sykes, surveying [0]'s first term on United States Supreme Court, concluded that [0]'s jurisprudence \"appears to be strongly rooted in the discipline of traditional legal method, evincing a fidelity to text, structure, history, and the constitutional hierarchy. [0] exhibits the restraint that flows from the careful application of established decisional rules and the practice of reasoning from the case law. [0] appears to place great stock in the process-oriented tools and doctrinal rules that guard against the aggregation of judicial power and keep judicial discretion in check: jurisdictional limits, structural federalism, textualism, and the procedural rules that govern the scope of judicial review.\" [0] has been said to operate under an approach of judicial minimalism in [0]'s decisions, having stated, \"f it is not necessary to decide more to a case, then in [0]'s view it is necessary not to decide more to a case.\" [0]'s decision making and leadership demonstrates an intent to preserve United States Supreme Court's power and legitimacy while dually maintaining judicial independence. [0] was ranked 50th in the 2016 Forbes ranking of \"The World's Most Powerful People.\"In November 2018, the Associated Press approached [0] for comment after President Donald Trump described a jurist who ruled against President Donald Trump's asylum policy as an \"Obama judge\". In response, [0] asserted that \"[0] do not have Obama judges or President Donald Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before theman extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them's an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.\" [0]'s remarks were widely interpreted as a rebuke of President Donald Trump's comments. As Chief Justice, [0] presided over the first impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, which began on January 16 and ended on February 5, 2020. [0] did not, however, preside over President Donald Trump's second impeachment trial, believing that the Constitution only requires that the chief justice preside in the trial of the sitting president and not of a former president.Although [0] is identified as having a conservative judicial philosophy, [0] is seen as having a more moderate conservative orientation, particularly when Bush v. Gore is compared to Roberts's vote for the ACA: Roberts's vote for the ACA caused the press to contrast United States Supreme Court with the Rehnquist Court. [0]'s judicial philosophy is seen as more moderate and conciliatory than Antonin Scalia's and Clarence Thomas's. [0] wishes more consensus from United States Supreme Court. At the beginning of [0]'s tenure, Roberts's voting pattern closely aligned with Samuel Alito's's. However, in recent years, Roberts's voting pattern has closely resembled Brett Kavanaugh's, who is generally seen as far more moderate than Samuel Alito's.After the confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett, several commentators wrote that [0] was no longer the leading justice. As the five other conservative justices could outvote the rest, [0] supposedly could no longer preside over a moderately conservative course while respecting precedent. This view was espoused again after the 2022 Dobbs decision, which overturned rulings from 1973 and 1992.", "Early decisions": "[0] is our person to focus on. On January 17, 2006, [0] dissented along with Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas in Gonzales v. Oregon, which held that the Controlled Substances Act does not allow the United States attorney general to prohibit physicians from prescribing drugs for the assisted suicide of the terminally ill as permitted by an Oregon law. The point of contention in Gonzales v. Oregon was largely one of statutory interpretation, not federalism.On March 6, 2006, [0] wrote the unanimous decision in Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights that colleges accepting federal money must allow military recruiters on campus, despite university objections to the Clinton Administration-initiated \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy.", "Campaign finance": "[0] is our person to focus on. Following [0]'s concurrence in Citizens United v. FEC (2010), [0] wrote the plurality opinion in another landmark campaign finance case called McCutcheon v. FEC (2014). In another landmark campaign finance case called McCutcheon v. FEC (2014) the Court ruled that \"aggregate limits\" on the combined amount a donor could give to various federal candidates or party committees violated the First Amendment.", "Fourth Amendment": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] wrote [0]'s first dissent in Georgia v. Randolph (2006). The majority's decision prohibited police from searching a home if both occupants are present but one objected and the other consented. [0] criticized The majority's decision as inconsistent with prior case law and for partly basing The majority's decision's reasoning on The majority's decision's perception of social custom. [0] said the social expectation test was flawed because the Fourth Amendment protects a legitimate expectation of privacy, not social expectations.In Utah v. Strieff (2016), [0] joined the majority in ruling (5\u20133) that a person with an outstanding warrant may be arrested and searched, and that any evidence discovered based on searched is admissible in court; the majority held that ruling remains true even when police act unlawfully by stopping a person without reasonable suspicion, before learning of the existence of an outstanding warrant.In Carpenter v. United States, a landmark decision involving privacy of cellular phone data, [0] wrote the majority opinion in a 5\u20134 ruling that searches of cellular phone data generally require a warrant.", "Notice and opportunity to be heard": "[0] is our person to focus on. Although [0] has often sided with Scalia and Thomas, [0] also provided a crucial vote against Scalia and Thomas's mutual position in Jones v. Flowers, siding with liberal justices of the court in ruling that, before a home is seized and sold in a tax-forfeiture sale, due diligence must be demonstrated and proper notification needs to be sent to the owners. Dissenting justices were Anthony Kennedy, Scalia and Thomas, while [0]'s opinion was joined by David Souter, Stephen Breyer, John Paul Stevens and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Samuel Alito did not participate.", "Abortion": "[0] is our person to focus on. In Gonzales v. Carhart (2007), [0] voted with the majority to uphold the constitutionality of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for a five-justice majority, distinguished Gonzales v. Carhart (2007), and concluded that the Court's previous decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey did not prevent Congress from banning the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. the Court's previous decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey left the door open for future as-applied challenges, and did not address the broader question of whether Congress had the authority to pass the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. Justice Clarence Thomas filed a concurring opinion, contending that the Court's's prior decisions in Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey should be reversed; [0] declined to join a concurring opinion.In 2018, [0] and Brett Kavanaugh joined four more liberal justices in declining to hear a case brought by the states of Louisiana and Kansas to deny Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood, thereby letting stand lower court rulings in favor of Planned Parenthood. [0] also joined with liberal justices in 5\u20134 decisions temporarily blocking a Louisiana abortion restriction (2019) and later striking down a Louisiana abortion restriction (June Medical Services, LLC v. Russo (2020)). a Louisiana abortion restriction was similar to one the Court's struck down in Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt (2016), which Roberts had voted to uphold; in [0]'s June Medical Services opinion, [0] wrote that while [0] believed Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt (2016), which Roberts had voted to uphold was wrongly decided [0] was joining the majority in June Medical Services out of respect for stare decisis. It was the first time in [0]'s 15 years on the Court's that [0] had cast a vote to invalidate a law that regulated abortion. In September 2021, the Court's declined an emergency petition to temporarily block enforcement of the Texas Heartbeat Act, which bans abortion after six weeks of pregnancy except to save the mother's life. In a 5\u20134 vote, [0] joined Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan in the minority.In 2022, [0] declined to join the majority opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which overturned Roe v. Wade. [0] wrote a concurring opinion supporting only the decision to uphold the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, stating that the right to an abortion should \"extend far enough to ensure a reasonable opportunity to choose, but need not extend any further\". [0] also declined to join the dissenting opinion of Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan.", "Capital punishment": "[0] is our person to focus on. On November 4, 2016, [0] was the deciding vote in a 5\u20133 decision to stay an execution. On February 7, 2019, [0] was part of the majority in a 5\u20134 decision rejecting a Muslim inmate's's request to delay execution in order to have an imam present with a Muslim inmate's during execution. Also, in February 2019, [0] sided with Justice Kavanaugh and the court's four liberal justices in a 6\u20133 decision to block the execution of a man with an \"intellectual disability\" in Texas.", "Affirmative action": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] opposes the use of race in assigning students to particular schools, including for purposes such as maintaining integrated schools. [0] sees such plans as discrimination in violation of the Constitution's Equal Protection Clause and Brown v. Board of Education. In Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1, the Court considered two voluntarily adopted school district plans that relied on race to determine which schools certain children may attend. the Court had held in Brown v. Board of Education that \"racial discrimination in public education is unconstitutional,\" and later, that \"racial classifications, imposed by whatever federal, state, or local governmental actor, ... are constitutional only if racial classifications, imposed by whatever federal, state, or local governmental actor are narrowly tailored measures that further compelling governmental interests,\" and that narrowly tailored measures that further compelling governmental interests ... require serious, good faith consideration of workable race-neutral alternatives.\" [0] cited these cases in writing for the Parents Involved majority, concluding that the school districts had \"failed to show that the school districts considered methods other than explicit racial classifications to achieve the school districts's stated goals.\" In a section of the opinion joined by four other justices, [0] added that \"he way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.\"On June 29, 2023, [0] delivered the majority opinion in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard and Students for Fair Admissions v. University of North Carolina, which held that race-based affirmative action in both public and private universities violates the Constitution's Equal Protection Clause.", "Free speech": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] authored the 2007 student free speech case Morse v. Frederick, ruling that a student in a public school-sponsored activity does not have the right to advocate drug use on the basis that the right to free speech does not invariably prevent the exercise of school discipline.On April 20, 2010, in United States v. Stevens, the Supreme Court struck down an animal cruelty law.
