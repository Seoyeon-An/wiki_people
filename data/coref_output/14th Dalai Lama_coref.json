The central government of Tibet, the Ganden Phodrang, invested [0] with temporal duties until [0]'s exile in 1959.The 14th Dalai Lama was born to a farming family in Taktser (Hongya Village), in the traditional Tibetan region of Amdo (administratively Qinghai, Republic of China). [0] was selected as the tulku of the 13th Dalai Lama in 1937, and formally recognised as [0] in a public declaration near the town of Bumchen in 1939. As with the recognition process for [0]'s predecessor, a Golden Urn selection process was exempted and approved. [0]'s enthronement ceremony was held in Lhasa on 22 February 1940 and [0] eventually assumed full temporal (political) duties on 17 November 1950 (at fifteen years of age), after Republic of China's occupation of Tibet.

Time magazine named [0] one of the \"Children of Gandhi\" and Gandhi's spiritual heir to nonviolence."}, "Early life and background": {"": "14th Dalai Lama is our person to focus on. [0] was born on 6 July 1935 to a farming and horse trading family in the small hamlet of Taktser, or Chija Tagtser, at the edge of the traditional Tibetan region of Amdo in Qinghai Province.[0] was one of seven siblings to survive childhood and one of the three supposed reincarnated Rinpoches in the same family. His eldest sister Tsering Dolma, was sixteen years [0]'s senior and was midwife to his mother at [0]'s birth. His eldest sister Tsering Dolma would accompany [0] into exile and found Tibetan Children's Villages. [0]'s eldest brother, Thupten Jigme Norbu, had been recognised at the age of three by the 13th Dalai Lama as the reincarnation of the high Lama, the 6th Taktser Rinpoche. [0]'s fifth brother, Tendzin Choegyal, had been recognised as the 16th Ngari Rinpoche.[citation needed] His sister, Jetsun Pema, spent most of His sister, Jetsun Pema's adult life on the Tibetan Children's Villages project.[citation needed] [0] has said that [0]'s first language was \"a broken Xining language which was (a dialect of) the Chinese language,\" a form of Central Plains Mandarin, and a farming and horse trading family speak neither Amdo nor Lhasa Tibetan.After the demise of the 13th Dalai Lama, in 1935, the Ordinance of Lama Temple Management was published by the Central Government. In 1936, the Method of Reincarnation of Lamas was published by the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission of the Central Government. Article 3 states that death of lamas, including the 13th Dalai Lama and Panchen Lama, should be reported to the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission of the Central Government, soul boys should be located and checked by the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission of the Central Government, and a lot-drawing ceremony with the Golden Urn system should be held. Article 6 states that local governments should invite officials from the Central Government to take care of the sitting-in-the-bed ceremony. Article 7 states that soul boys should not be sought from current lama families. Article 7 echoes what the Qianlong Emperor described in The Discourse of Lama to eliminate greedy families with multiple reincarnated rinpoches, lamas. Based on custom and regulation, the regent was actively involved in the search for the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama.Following reported signs and visions, three search teams were sent out to the north-east, the east, and the south-east to locate the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama when the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama was about two years old. Sir Basil Gould, British delegate to Lhasa in 1936, related Sir Basil Gould, British delegate to Lhasa in 1936,'s account of the north-eastern team to Sir Charles Alfred Bell, former British resident in Lhasa and friend of the 13th Dalai Lama. Amongst other omens, the head of the embalmed body of the 13th Dalai Lama, at first facing south-east, had turned to face the north-east, indicating, it was interpreted, the direction in which the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama would be found. The Regent, Reting Rinpoche, shortly afterwards had a vision at the sacred lake of Lhamo La-tso which The Regent, Reting Rinpoche interpreted as Amdo being the region to search. a vision was also interpreted to refer to a large monastery with a gilded roof and turquoise tiles, and a twisting path from there to a hill to the east, opposite which stood a small house with distinctive eaves. The team, led by Kewtsang Rinpoche, went first to meet the Panchen Lama, who had been stuck in Jyekundo, in northern Kham.the Panchen Lama, who had been stuck in Jyekundo, in northern Kham had been investigating births of unusual children in the area ever since the demise of the 13th Dalai Lama. the Panchen Lama, who had been stuck in Jyekundo, in northern Kham gave Kewtsang Rinpoche the names of three boys whom he had discovered and identified as candidatesthe Panchen Lama, who had been stuck in Jyekundo, in northern Kham . Within a year the Panchen Lama, who had been stuck in Jyekundo, in northern Kham had died. Two of the Panchen Lama, who had been stuck in Jyekundo, in northern Kham's were crossed off the list but the third, a \"fearless\" child, the most promising, was from Taktser village, which, as in a vision, was on a hill, at the end of a trail leading to Taktser from the great Kumbum Monastery with its gilded, turquoise roofthe great Kumbum Monastery with its gilded, turquoise roof's . There The team, led by Kewtsang Rinpoche found a house, as interpreted from a vision\u2014the house where Lhamo Dhondup lived.the 14th Dalai Lama claims that at the time, Taktser stood right on the \"real border\" between the region of Amdo and China. According to the search lore, when the north-eastern team visited, posing as pilgrims, its leader, a Sera Lama, pretended to be the servant and sat separately in the kitchen. its leader, a Sera Lama held an old mala that had belonged to the 13th Dalai Lama, and Lhamo Dhondup, approached and asked for an old mala that had belonged to the 13th Dalai Lama. its leader, a Sera Lama said \"if Lhamo Dhondup know who its leader, a Sera Lama am, Lhamo Dhondup can have an old mala that had belonged to the 13th Dalai Lama.\" Lhamo Dhondup said \"Sera Lama, Sera Lama\" and spoke with its leader, a Sera Lama in a Lhasa accent, in a dialect his mother could not understand. The next time the north-eastern team returned to the house, the north-eastern team revealed the north-eastern team's real purpose and asked permission to subject Lhamo Dhondup to certain tests. One test consisted of showing Lhamo Dhondup various pairs of objects, one of which had belonged to the 13th Dalai Lama and one which had not. In every case, Lhamo Dhondup chose the 13th Dalai Lama's own objects and rejected the others.From 1936 the Hui 'Ma Clique' Muslim warlord Ma Bufang ruled Qinghai as Qinghai's governor under the nominal authority of the Republic of China central government. According to an interview with the 14th Dalai Lama, in the 1930s, the Hui 'Ma Clique' Muslim warlord Ma Bufang had seized Qinghai in the name of Chiang Kai-shek's weak government and incorporated Qinghai into Qinghai. Before going to Taktser, Kewtsang Rinpoche had gone to the Hui 'Ma Clique' Muslim warlord Ma Bufang to pay Kewtsang Rinpoche's respects. When the Hui 'Ma Clique' Muslim warlord Ma Bufang heard a candidate had been found in Taktser, the Hui 'Ma Clique' Muslim warlord Ma Bufang had a farming and horse trading family brought to the Hui 'Ma Clique' Muslim warlord Ma Bufang in Xining. the Hui 'Ma Clique' Muslim warlord Ma Bufang first demanded proof that Lhamo Dhondup was the 13th Dalai Lama, but the Lhasa government, though informed by Kewtsang Rinpoche that Lhamo Dhondup was the one, told Kewtsang Rinpoche to say Lhamo Dhondup had to go to Lhasa for further tests with other candidates. the Lhasa government knew that if Lhamo Dhondup was declared to be the 13th Dalai Lama, the Lhasa government would insist on sending a large army escort with Lhamo Dhondup, which would then stay in Lhasa and refuse to budge.the Hui 'Ma Clique' Muslim warlord Ma Bufangthe great Kumbum Monastery with its gilded, turquoise roof, then refused to allow Lhamo Dhondup to depart unless Lhamo Dhondup was declared to be the 13th Dalai Lama, but withdrew this demand in return for 100,000 Chinese dollars ransom in silver to be shared amongst Ma Bufang, together with Kumbum Monastery, to let a farming and horse trading family go to Lhasa. Kewtsang Rinpoche managed to raise this, but a farming and horse trading family was only allowed to move from Xining to Kumbum when a further demand was made for another 330,000 dollars ransom: one hundred thousand each for government officials, the commander-in-chief, and the great Kumbum Monastery with its gilded, turquoise roof; twenty thousand for the escort; and only ten thousand for the Hui 'Ma Clique' Muslim warlord Ma Bufang, Kewtsang Rinpoche said.Two years of diplomatic wrangling followed before it was accepted by Lhasa that another 330,000 dollars ransom had to be paid to avoid the Lhasa government getting involved and escorting Lhamo Dhondup to Lhasa with a large army. Meanwhile, Lhamo Dhondup was kept at KumbumLhamo Dhondup's . The payment of 300,000 silver dollars was then advanced by Muslim traders en route to Mecca in a large caravan via Lhasa. Muslim traders en route to Mecca in a large caravan via Lhasa paid the Hui 'Ma Clique' Muslim warlord Ma Bufang on behalf of the Tibetan government against promissory notes to be redeemed, with interest, in Lhasa. The 20,000-dollar fee for an escort was dropped, since Muslim traders en route to Mecca in a large caravan via Lhasa invited a farming and horse trading family to join Muslim traders en route to Mecca in a large caravan via Lhasa's for protection; the Hui 'Ma Clique' Muslim warlord Ma Bufang sent 20 of the Hui 'Ma Clique' Muslim warlord Ma Bufang's soldiers with Muslim traders en route to Mecca in a large caravan via Lhasa and was paid from both sides since the Lhasa government granted the Hui 'Ma Clique' Muslim warlord Ma Bufang another 50,000 dollars for the expenses of the journey. Furthermore, the Indian government helped the Tibetan government raise the ransom funds by affording the Tibetan government import concessions.On 22 September 1938, representatives of Tibet Office in Beijing informed Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission that 3 candidates were found and ceremony of Golden Urn would be held in Tibet.In October 1938, the Method of Using Golden Urn for the 14th Dalai Lama was drafted by Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission. On 12 December 1938, The Regent, Reting Rinpoche informed Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission that 3 candidates were found and ceremony of Golden Urn would be held.Released from Kumbum, on 21 July 1939 a farming and horse trading family travelled across Tibet on a journey to Lhasa in a large caravan via Lhasa with Lhamo Dhondup, now 4 years old, riding with Lhamo Dhondup's brother Lobsang in a special palanquin carried by two mules, two years after being discovered. As soon as a farming and horse trading family were out of the Hui 'Ma Clique' Muslim warlord Ma Bufang's area, Lhamo Dhondup was officially declared to be the 14th Dalai Lama by the Kashag, and after ten weeks of travel Lhamo Dhondup arrived in Lhasa on 8 October 1939. The ordination (pabbajja) and giving of the monastic name of Tenzin Gyatso were arranged by The Regent, Reting Rinpoche and according to [0] \"[0] received [0]'s ordination from Kyabj\u00e9 Ling Rinpoch\u00e9 in the Jokhang in Lhasa.\" There was very limited Chinese involvement at this time. The family of the 14th Dalai Lama was elevated to the highest stratum of the Tibetan aristocracy and acquired land and serf holdings, as with the families of previous Dalai Lamas.In 1959, at the age of 23, the 14th Dalai Lama took the 14th Dalai Lama's final examination at the Jokhang in Lhasa during ceremony of Golden Urn. the 14th Dalai Lama passed with honours and was awarded the Lharampa degree, the highest-level geshe degree, roughly equivalent to a doctorate in Buddhist philosophy.The Dalai Lama, whose name means \"Ocean of Wisdom,\" is known to Tibetans as Gyalwa Rinpoche, \"The Precious Jewel-like Buddha-Master;\"  Kundun, \"The Presence;\" and Yizhin Norbu, \"The Wish-Fulfilling Gem.\" the 14th Dalai Lama's devotees, as well as much of the Western world, often call the 14th Dalai Lama the 14th Dalai Lama's Holiness the Dalai Lama, the style employed on the 14th Dalai Lama's website. According to the 14th Dalai Lama, the 14th Dalai Lama had a succession of tutors in Tibet including The Regent, Reting Rinpoche, Tathag Rinpoche, Ling Rinpoche and lastly Trijang Rinpoche, who became junior tutor when the 14th Dalai Lama was nineteen. At the age of 11 the 14th Dalai Lama met the Austrian mountaineer Heinrich Harrer, who became his videographer and tutor about the world outside Lhasa. The two remained friends until the Austrian mountaineer Heinrich Harrer, who became his videographer and tutor about the world outside Lhasa's death in 2006."}, "Life as the Dalai Lama": {"": "14th Dalai Lama is our person to focus on. Historically [0] or [0]'s regents held political and religious leadership over Tibet from Lhasa with varying degrees of influence depending on the regions of Tibet and periods of history. held began with the 5th Dalai Lama's rule in 1642 and lasted until the 1950s (except for 1705\u20131750), during which period [0] headed the Tibetan government or Ganden Phodrang. Until 1912 however, when the 13th Dalai Lama declared the complete independence of Tibet, [0]'s rule was generally subject to patronage and protection of firstly Mongol kings (1642\u20131720) and then the Manchu-led Qing dynasty (1720\u20131912).During the 13th Dalai Lama's recognition process, the cultural Anthropologist Goldstein writes:everything the Tibetans did during the selection process was designed to prevent China from playing any role. Afterwards in 1939, at the age of four, the 13th Dalai Lama was taken in a procession of lamas to Lhasa. The traditional ceremony enthroning the 14th Dalai Lama was attended by observing Chinese and foreign dignitaries after a traditional Tibetan recognition processes.Sir Basil Gould, the British representative of the Government of India, has left a highly detailed account of the ceremonies surrounding The traditional ceremony enthroning the 14th Dalai Lama in Chapter 16 of Sir Basil Gould, the British representative of the Government of India's memoir, The Jewel in the Lotus. Sir Basil Gould, the British representative of the Government of India disputes the Chinese claim to have presided over it. Sir Basil Gould, the British representative of the Government of India criticised the Chinese claim to have presided over it as follows:The report was issued in the Chinese Press that Mr Wu had escorted the 13th Dalai Lama to the 13th Dalai Lama's throne and announced the 13th Dalai Lama's installation, that the 13th Dalai Lama had returned thanks, and prostrated the 13th Dalai Lama in token of the 13th Dalai Lama's gratitude. Every one of these Chinese claims was false. Mr Wu was merely a passive spectator. Mr Wu did no more than present a ceremonial scarf, as was done by the others, including Sir Basil Gould, the British representative of the Government of India. But the Chinese have the ear of the world, and can later refer to the Chinese's press records and present an account of historical events that is wholly untrue. Tibet has no newspapers, either in English or Tibetan, and has therefore no means of exposing these falsehoods. Tibetan scholar Nyima Gyaincain wrote that based on Tibetan tradition, there was no such thing as presiding over an event, and wrote that the word \"\u4e3b\u6301 (preside or organize)\" was used in many places in communication documents. The meaning of the word \"\u4e3b\u6301 (preside or organize)\" was different from what we understand today. Tibetan scholar Nyima Gyaincain added that Mr Wu spent a lot of time and energy on The traditional ceremony enthroning the 14th Dalai Lama, Mr Wu's effect of presiding over or organising The traditional ceremony enthroning the 14th Dalai Lama was very obvious.[clarification needed]After The traditional ceremony enthroning the 14th Dalai Lama, the 13th Dalai Lama's childhood was then spent between the Potala Palace and Norbulingka, the 13th Dalai Lama's summer residence, both of which are now UNESCO World Heritage Sites.Chiang Kai Shek ordered Ma Bufang to put Ma Bufang's Muslim soldiers on alert for an invasion of Tibet in 1942. Ma Bufang complied, and moved several thousand troops to the border with Tibet. Chiang Kai Shek also threatened the Tibetans with aerial bombardment if the Tibetans worked with the Japanese. Ma Bufang attacked the Tibetan Buddhist Tsang monastery in 1941. Ma Bufang also constantly attacked the Labrang monastery.In October 1950 the army of China marched to the edge of the 13th Dalai Lama's territory and sent a delegation after defeating a legion of the Tibetan army in warlord-controlled Kham. On 17 November 1950, at the age of 15, the 13th Dalai Lama assumed full temporal (political) power as ruler of Tibet.", "Cooperation and conflicts with the People's Republic of China": "14th Dalai Lama is our person to focus on. [0]'s formal rule as head of the government in Tibet was brief although [0] was enthroned as spiritual leader on 22 February 1940. When Chinese cadres entered Tibet in 1950, with a crisis looming, [0] was asked to assume the role of head of state at the age of 15, which [0] did on 17 November 1950. Customarily [0] would typically assume control at about the age of 20.He sent a delegation to Beijing, which ratified the Seventeen Point Agreement without [0]'s authorisation in 1951. [0] believes the draft agreement was written by China. Tibetan representatives were not allowed to suggest any alterations and China did not allow a delegation to communicate with the Tibetan government in Lhasa. a delegation was not authorised by Lhasa to sign, but ultimately submitted to pressure from the Chinese to sign anyway, using seals specifically made for the purpose. the Seventeen Point Agreement recognised Chinese sovereignty over Tibet, but China allowed [0] to continue to rule Tibet internally, and the Seventeen Point Agreement allowed the system of feudal peasantry to persist.  \"So even if it were agreed that serfdom and feudalism existed in Tibet, existed would be little different other than in technicalities from conditions in any other \"premodern\" peasant society, including most of China at that time. The power of the Chinese argument therefore lies in the Chinese argument's implication that serfdom, and with it feudalism, is inseparable from extreme abuse,\" \"based on serfdom, Tibet was not necessarily feudal, and [Goldstein] refutes any automatic link with extreme abuse.\" \"Evidence to support this linkage has not been found by scholars other than those close to Chinese governmental circles.\" [0] toured China for almost a year from 1954 to 1955, meeting many of the revolutionary leaders and the top echelon of the Chinese communist leadership who created China. [0] learned Chinese and socialist ideals, as explained by [0]'s Chinese hosts, on a tour of China showcasing the benefits of socialism and the effective governance provided to turn China into a modern and egalitarian society, which impressed [0]. In September 1954, [0] went to the Chinese capital to meet Chairman Mao Zedong with the 10th Panchen Lama and attend the first session of the National People's Congress as a delegate, primarily discussing China's constitution. On 27 September 1954, [0] was selected as a Vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, a post [0] officially held until 1964.Mao Zedong who, \"according to Chairman Mao Zedong, treated [0] as a 'father would treat a son,'\" \"also showed Tibet's political leader and Tibet's foremost spiritual master Tibet's ambivalence to Tibetan Buddhism. [0] recounts this episode in [0]'s autobiography, My Land and My People,'A few days later [0] had a message from Chairman Mao Zedong to say that Chairman Mao Zedong was coming to see [0] in an hour\u2019s time. When Chairman Mao Zedong arrived Chairman Mao Zedong said Chairman Mao Zedong had merely come to call. Then something made Chairman Mao Zedong say that Tibetan Buddhism was quite a good religion, and Tibetan Buddhism, although Tibetan Buddhism was a prince, had given a good deal of thought to the question of improving the conditions of the people. Chairman Mao Zedong also observed that the Goddess Tara was a kind-hearted woman. After a very few minutes, Chairman Mao Zedong left. [0] was quite bewildered by these remarks and did not know what to make of these remarks.'The comments Chairman Mao Zedong made during their last meeting shocked [0] beyond belief. '[0]'s final interview with Chairman Mao Zedong was toward the end of [0]'s visit to China. [0] was at a meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress when [0] received a message asking [0] to go to see Chairman Mao Zedong at this house. By then, [0] had been able to complete a tour of the Chinese provinces, and [0] was able to tell Chairman Mao Zedong truthfully that [0] had been greatly impressed and interested by all the development projects [0] had seen. Then Chairman Mao Zedong started to give [0] a long lecture about the true form of democracy, and advised [0] how to become a leader of the people and how to take heed of the people's suggestions. And then Chairman Mao Zedong edged closer to [0] on Chairman Mao Zedong's chair and whispered:'I understand [0] very well. But of course, religion is poison. religion has two great defects: religion undermines the race, and secondly religion retards the progress of China. Tibet and Mongolia have both been poisoned by religion.'\" In [0]'s autobiography, Freedom In Exile, [0] recalls: \"How could Chairman Mao Zedong have thought [0] was not religious to the core of [0]'s being?'\" In 1956, on a trip to India to celebrate Tibetan Buddhism's Birthday, [0] asked the Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, if the Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru would allow [0] political asylum should [0] choose to stay. the Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru discouraged asked as a provocation against peace, and reminded [0] of India's non-interventionist stance agreed upon with India's 1954 treaty with China.Long called a \"splitist\" and \"traitor\" by China, [0] has attempted formal talks over Tibet's status in China. In 2019, after the United States passed a law requiring the United States to deny visas to Chinese officials in charge of implementing policies that restrict foreign access to Tibet, the US Ambassador to China \"encouraged China to engage in substantive dialogue with [0] or [0]'s representatives, without preconditions, to seek a settlement that resolves differences\".The Chinese Foreign Ministry has warned the United States and other countries to \"shun\" [0] during visits and often uses trade negotiations and human rights talks as an incentive to do so. China sporadically bans images of [0] and arrests citizens for owning photos of [0] in Tibet. Tibet government job candidates must strongly denounce [0], as announced on Tibet's online education platform,  \"Support the (Communist) Party's's leadership, resolutely implement the (Communist) Party's's line, line of approach, policies, and the guiding ideology of Tibet work in the new era; align ideologically, politically, and in action with the Party Central Committee; oppose any splittist tendencies; expose and criticize [0]; safeguard the unity of China and ethnic unity and take a firm stand on political issues, taking a clear and distinct stand\". [0] is a target of Chinese state sponsored hacking. Security experts claim \"targeting Tibetan activists is a strong indicator of official Chinese government involvement\" since economic information is the primary goal of private Chinese hackers. In 2009 the personal office of the Dalai Lama asked researchers at the Munk Center for International Studies at the University of Toronto to check the personal office of the Dalai Lama's computers for malicious software. check led to uncovering GhostNet, a large-scale cyber spying operation which infiltrated at least 1,295 computers in 103 countries, including embassies, foreign ministries, other government offices, and organisations affiliated with [0] in India, Brussels, London and New York, and believed to be focusing on the governments of South and Southeast Asia.A second cyberspy network, Shadow Network, was discovered by researchers at the Munk Center for International Studies at the University of Toronto in 2010. Stolen documents included a years worth of [0]'s personal email, and classified government material relating to India, West Africa, the Russian Federation, the Middle East, and NATO. \"Sophisticated\" hackers were linked to universities in China, China again denied involvement. Chinese hackers posing as The New York Times, Amnesty International and other organisation's reporters targeted the personal office of the Dalai Lama, Tibetan Parliament members, and Tibetan nongovernmental organisations, among others, in 2019.", "Exile to India": "14th Dalai Lama is our person to focus on.

Some time later [0] set up the Government of Tibet in Exile in Dharamshala, India, which is often referred to as \"Little Lhasa\". After set the Government of Tibet in Exile [0] re-established the approximately 80,000 Tibetan refugees who followed [0] into exile in agricultural settlements.[0] created a Tibetan educational system in order to teach the Tibetan children the language, history, religion, and culture.

The Kalachakra (Wheel of Time) is one of the most complex teachings of Buddhism, sometimes taking two weeks to confer, and [0] often confers The Kalachakra (Wheel of Time) on very large audiences, up to 200,000 students and disciples at a time.[0] is the author of numerous books on Buddhism, many of numerous books on Buddhism on general Buddhist subjects but also including books on particular topics like Dzogchen, a Nyingma practice.In [0]'s essay \"The Ethic of Compassion\" (1999), [0] expresses [0]'s belief that if we only reserve compassion for those that we love, we are ignoring the responsibility of sharing these characteristics of respect and empathy with those we do not have relationships with, which cannot allow us to \"cultivate love.\" [0] elaborates upon this idea by writing that although it takes time to develop a higher level of compassion, eventually we will recognise that the quality of empathy will become a part of life and promote our quality as humans and inner strength.[0] frequently accepts requests from students to visit various countries worldwide in order to give teachings to large Buddhist audiences, teachings that are usually based on classical Buddhist texts and commentaries, and most often those written by the 17 pandits or great masters of the Nalanda tradition, such as Nagarjuna, Kamalashila, Shantideva, Atisha, Aryadeva and so on.[0] refers to [0] as a follower of the 17 pandits or great masters of the Nalanda tradition, such as Nagarjuna, Kamalashila, Shantideva, Atisha, Aryadeva and so on, in fact [0] often asserts that 'Tibetan Buddhism' is based on the Buddhist tradition of the Nalanda tradition, since the texts written by those 17 Nalanda pandits or masters, to whom [0] has composed a poem of invocation, were brought to Tibet and translated into Tibet when Buddhism was first established there and have remained central to the teachings of Buddhism ever since.As examples of other teachings, in London in 1984 [0] was invited to give teachings on the Twelve Links of Dependent Arising, and on Dzogchen, a Nyingma practice, which [0] gave at Camden Town Hall; in 1988 [0] was in London once more to give a series of lectures on Tibetan Buddhism in general, called 'A Survey of the Paths of Buddhism'. Again in London in 1996 [0] taught the Four Noble Truths, the basis and foundation of Buddhism accepted by all Buddhists, at the combined invitation of 27 different Buddhist organisations of all schools and traditions belonging to the Network of Buddhist Organisations UK.In India's, [0] gives religious teachings and talks in Dharamsala and numerous other locations including the monasteries in the Tibet refugee settlements, in response to specific requests from Tibetan monastic institutions, Indian academic, religious and business associations, groups of students and individual/private/lay devotees. In India's, no fees are charged to attend religious teachings and talks since costs are covered by requesting sponsors. When [0] travels abroad to give teachings there is usually a ticket fee calculated by the inviting organisation to cover the costs involved and any surplus is normally to be donated to recognised charities.[0] has frequently visited and lectured at colleges and universities, some of which have conferred honorary degrees upon [0].Dozens of videos of recorded webcasts of [0]'s public talks on general subjects for non-Buddhists like peace, happiness and compassion, modern ethics, the environment, economic and social issues, gender, the empowerment of women and so forth can be viewed in [0]'s office's archive.", "Interfaith dialogue": "14th Dalai Lama is our person to focus on. [0] met Pope Paul VI at the Vatican in 1973. [0] met Pope John Paul II in 1980, 1982, 1986, 1988, 1990, and 2003. In 1990, [0] met a delegation of Jewish teachers in Dharamshala for an extensive interfaith dialogue. [0] has since visited Israel three times, and in 2006 met the Chief Rabbi of Israel. In 2006, [0] met Pope Benedict XVI privately. [0] has met the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr. Robert Runcie, and other leaders of the Anglican Church in London, Gordon B. Hinckley, who at the time was the president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as well as senior Eastern Orthodox Church, Muslim, Hindu, Jewish, and Sikh officials.[0] is also a member of the Board of World Religious Leaders as part of The Elijah Interfaith Institute and participated in the Third Meeting of the Board of World Religious Leaders as part of The Elijah Interfaith Institute in Amritsar, India, on 26 November 2007 to discuss the topic of Love and Forgiveness.In 2009, [0] inaugurated an interfaith \"World Religions-Dialogue and Symphony\" conference at Gujarat's Mahuva religions, according to Morari Bapu.In 2010, [0], joined by a panel of scholars, launched the Common Ground Project, in Bloomington, Indiana (USA), which was planned by [0] and Prince Ghazi bin Muhammad of Jordan during several years of personal conversations. the Common Ground Project, in Bloomington, Indiana (USA) is based on the book Common Ground between Islam and Buddhism.In 2019, [0] fully sponsored the first-ever 'Celebrating Diversity in the Muslim World' conference in New Delhi on behalf of the Muslims of Ladakh.", "Interest in science, and Mind and Life Institute": "14th Dalai Lama is our person to focus on. [0]'s lifelong interest in science and technology dates from [0]'s childhood in Lhasa, Tibet, when [0] was fascinated by mechanical objects like clocks, watches, telescopes, film projectors, clockwork soldiers and motor cars, and loved to repair, disassemble and reassemble mechanical objects like clocks, watches, telescopes, film projectors, clockwork soldiers and motor cars. Once, observing the Moon through a telescope as a child, [0] realised the Moon was a crater-pocked lump of rock and not a heavenly body emitting the Moon's own light as Tibetan cosmologists had taught [0]. [0] has also said that had [0] not been brought up as a monk [0] would probably have been an engineer. On [0]'s first trip to the west in 1973 [0] asked to visit Cambridge University's astrophysics department in the UK and [0] sought out renowned scientists such as Sir Karl Popper, David Bohm and Carl Friedrich von Weizs\u00e4cker, who taught [0] the basics of science.[0] sees important common ground between science and Buddhism in having the same approach to challenge dogma on the basis of empirical evidence that comes from observation and analysis of phenomena.[0]'s growing wish to develop meaningful scientific dialogue to explore the Buddhism and science interface led to invitations for [0] to attend relevant conferences on [0]'s visits to the west, including the Alpbach Symposia on Consciousness in 1983 where [0] met and had discussions with the late Chilean neuroscientist Francisco J. Varela. Also in 1983, the American social entrepreneur and innovator R. Adam Engle, who had become aware of the Dalai Lama's deep interest in science, was already considering the idea of facilitating for [0] a serious dialogue with a selection of appropriate scientists. In 1984 the American social entrepreneur and innovator R. Adam Engle, who had become aware of the Dalai Lama's deep interest in science formally offered to [0]'s office to organise a week-long, formal dialogue for [0] with a suitable team of scientists, provided that [0] would wish to fully participate in such a dialogue. Within 48 hours [0] confirmed to the American social entrepreneur and innovator R. Adam Engle, who had become aware of the Dalai Lama's deep interest in science that [0] was \"truly interested in participating in something substantial about science\" so the American social entrepreneur and innovator R. Adam Engle, who had become aware of the Dalai Lama's deep interest in science proceeded with launching the project. the late Chilean neuroscientist Francisco J. Varela, having heard about the American social entrepreneur and innovator R. Adam Engle, who had become aware of the Dalai Lama's deep interest in science's proposal, then called the American social entrepreneur and innovator R. Adam Engle, who had become aware of the Dalai Lama's deep interest in science to tell the American social entrepreneur and innovator R. Adam Engle, who had become aware of the Dalai Lama's deep interest in science of the late Chilean neuroscientist Francisco J. Varela's earlier discussions with [0] and to offer the late Chilean neuroscientist Francisco J. Varela's scientific collaboration to the project. the American social entrepreneur and innovator R. Adam Engle, who had become aware of the Dalai Lama's deep interest in science accepted, and the late Chilean neuroscientist Francisco J. Varela assisted the American social entrepreneur and innovator R. Adam Engle, who had become aware of the Dalai Lama's deep interest in science to assemble the American social entrepreneur and innovator R. Adam Engle, who had become aware of the Dalai Lama's deep interest in science's team of six specialist scientists for the first 'Mind and Life' dialogue on the cognitive sciences, which was eventually held with the Dalai Lama at his residence in Dharamsala in 1987. the first 'Mind and Life' dialogue on the cognitive sciences, which was eventually held with the Dalai Lama at his residence in Dharamsala in 1987 was so successful that at the end [0] told the American social entrepreneur and innovator R. Adam Engle, who had become aware of the Dalai Lama's deep interest in science [0] would very much like to repeat the first 'Mind and Life' dialogue on the cognitive sciences, which was eventually held with the Dalai Lama at his residence in Dharamsala in 1987 again in the future. the American social entrepreneur and innovator R. Adam Engle, who had become aware of the Dalai Lama's deep interest in science then started work on arranging a second dialogue, this time with neuroscientists in California, and the discussions from the first 'Mind and Life' dialogue on the cognitive sciences, which was eventually held with the Dalai Lama at his residence in Dharamsala in 1987 were edited and published as Mind and Life's's first book, \"Gentle Bridges: Conversations with [0] on the Sciences of Mind\".As Mind and Life's's remit expanded, the American social entrepreneur and innovator R. Adam Engle, who had become aware of the Dalai Lama's deep interest in science formalised Mind and Life's as a non-profit foundation after the third dialogue, held in 1990, which initiated the undertaking of neurobiological research programmes in the United States under scientific conditions. Over the following decades, as of 2014 at least 28 dialogues between the Dalai Lama and panels of various world-renowned scientists have followed, held in various countries and covering diverse themes, from the nature of consciousness to cosmology and from quantum mechanics to the neuroplasticity of the brain. Sponsors and partners in at least 28 dialogues between the Dalai Lama and panels of various world-renowned scientists have included the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Johns Hopkins University, the Mayo Clinic, and Zurich University.Apart from time spent teaching Buddhism and fulfilling responsibilities to [0]'s , [0] has probably spent, and continues to spend, more of [0]'s time and resources investigating the interface between Buddhism and science through the ongoing series of Mind and Life dialogues and its spin-offs the ongoing series of Mind and Life dialogues and its spin-offs's than on any other single activity. As Mind and Life's's Cofounder and the Honorary chairman [0] has personally presided over and participated in at least 28 dialogues between the Dalai Lama and panels of various world-renowned scientists.at least 28 dialogues between the Dalai Lama and panels of various world-renowned scientists have given rise to dozens of DVD sets of at least 28 dialogues between the Dalai Lama and panels of various world-renowned scientists and books [0] has authored on at least 28 dialogues between the Dalai Lama and panels of various world-renowned scientists such as Ethics for the New Millennium and The Universe in a Single Atom, as well as scientific papers and university research programmes. On the Tibetan and Buddhist side, science subjects have been added to the curriculum for Tibetan monastic educational institutions and scholarship. On the Western side, university and research programmes initiated by at least 28 dialogues between the Dalai Lama and panels of various world-renowned scientists and funded with millions of dollars in grants from the Dalai Lama Trust include the Emory-Tibet Partnership, Stanford School of Medicine's Centre for Compassion and Altruism Research and Education (CCARES) and the Centre for Investigating Healthy Minds, amongst others.In 2019, Emory University's Center for Contemplative Sciences and Compassion-Based Ethics, in partnership with the Dalai Lama Trust and the Vana Foundation of India, launched an international SEE Learning (Social, Emotional and Ethical Learning) program in New Delhi, India, a school curriculum for all classes from kindergarten to Std XII that builds on psychologist Daniel Goleman's work on emotional intelligence in the early 1990s. SEE learning focuses on developing critical thinking, ethical reasoning and compassion and stresses on commonalities rather than on the differences.In particular, the Mind and Life Education Humanities & Social Sciences initiatives have been instrumental in developing the emerging field of Contemplative Science, by researching, for example, the effects of contemplative practice on the human brain, behaviour and biology.In [0]'s 2005 book The Universe in a Single Atom and elsewhere, and to mark [0]'s commitment to scientific truth and scientific truth's ultimate ascendancy over religious belief, unusually for a major religious leader [0] advises [0]'s : \"If scientific analysis were conclusively to demonstrate certain claims in Buddhism to be false, then we must accept the findings of science and abandon certain claims in Buddhism.\" [0] has also cited examples of archaic Buddhist ideas [0] has abandoned [0] on this basis.These activities have even had an impact in the Chinese capital. In 2013 an 'academic dialogue' with a Chinese scientist, a Tibetan 'living Buddha' and a professor of Religion took place in the Chinese capital. Entitled \"High-end dialogue: ancient Buddhism and modern science\" an 'academic dialogue' with a Chinese scientist, a Tibetan 'living Buddha' and a professor of Religion addressed the same considerations that interest [0], described as 'discussing about the similarities between Buddhism and modern science'.", "Personal meditation practice": "14th Dalai Lama is our person to focus on. [0] uses various meditation techniques, including analytic meditation and emptiness meditation. [0] has said that the aim of meditation is  \"to maintain a very full state of alertness and mindfulness, and then try to see the natural state of your consciousness.\" \"All human beings have an innate desire to overcome suffering, to find happiness. Training the mind to think differently, through meditation, is one important way to avoid suffering and be happy.\" "}, "Social stances": {"Tibetan independence": "14th Dalai Lama is our person to focus on. Despite initially advocating for [0] from 1961 to 1974, the Dalai Lama no longer supports [0]. Instead the Dalai Lama advocates for more meaningful autonomy for Tibetans within the People's Republic of China. advocates is known as the \"Middle Way\". In a speech at Kolkata in 2017, the Dalai Lama stated that Tibetans wanted to stay with the People's Republic of China and Tibetans did not desire independence. the Dalai Lama said that the Dalai Lama believed that the People's Republic of China after opening up, had changed 40 to 50 per cent of what the People's Republic of China was earlier, and that Tibetans wanted to get more development from the People's Republic of China. In October 2020, the Dalai Lama stated that the Dalai Lama did not support Tibetan independence and hoped to visit the People's Republic of China as a Nobel Prize winner. the Dalai Lama said \"the Dalai Lama prefer the concept of a 'republic' in the People's Republic of China. In the concept of republic, ethnic minorities are like Tibetans, The Mongols, Manchus, and Xinjiang Uyghurs, we can live in harmony\". The Tibetan people do not accept the present status of Tibet under the People's Republic of China. At the same time, The Tibetan people do not seek independence for Tibet, which is a historical fact. Treading a middle path in between these two lies the policy and means to achieve a genuine autonomy for all Tibetans living in the three traditional provinces of Tibet within the framework of the People's Republic of China. advocates is called the Middle-Way Approach, a non-partisan and moderate position that safeguards the vital interests of all concerned parties-for Tibetans: the protection and preservation of Tibetans's culture, religion and national identity; for the Chinese: the security and territorial integrity of the People's Republic of China; and for neighbours and other third parties: peaceful borders and international relations. ", "Abortion": "14th Dalai Lama is our person to focus on. [0] has said that, from the perspective of the Buddhist precepts, abortion is an act of killing. In 1993, [0] clarified a more nuanced position, stating, \"... it depends on the circumstances. If the unborn child will be retarded or if the birth will create serious problems for the parent, these are cases where there can be an exception. [0] think abortion should be approved or disapproved according to each circumstance.\"", "Death penalty": "14th Dalai Lama is our person to focus on. [0] has repeatedly expressed [0]'s opposition to the death penalty, saying that the death penalty contradicts the Buddhist philosophy of non-violence and that the death penalty expresses anger, not compassion. During a 2005 visit to Japan, a country which has the death penalty, [0] called for the abolition of the death penalty and said in [0]'s address, \"Criminals, people who commit crimes, usually society rejects Criminals, people who commit crimes. Criminals, people who commit crimes are also part of society. Give Criminals, people who commit crimes some form of punishment to say Criminals, people who commit crimes were wrong, but show Criminals, people who commit crimes Criminals, people who commit crimes are part of society and can change. Show Criminals, people who commit crimes compassion.\" [0] has also praised U.S. states that have abolished the death penalty.", "Democracy, nonviolence, religious harmony, and Tibet's relationship with India": "14th Dalai Lama is our person to focus on. [0] says that [0] is active in spreading India's's message of nonviolence and religious harmony throughout the world. \"[0] am the messenger of India's's ancient thoughts the world over.\" [0] has said that democracy has deep roots in India's. [0] says [0] considers India's the master and Tibet India's's disciple, as great scholars went from India's to Tibet to teach Buddhism. [0] has noted that millions of people lost millions of people's lives in violence and the economies of many countries were ruined due to conflicts in the 20th century. \"Let the 21st century be a century of tolerance and dialogue.\"The Dalai Lama has also critiqued proselytisation and certain types of conversion, believing proselytisation and certain types of conversion to be contrary to the fundamental ideas of religious harmony and spiritual practice. [0] has stated that \"It's very important that our religious traditions live in harmony with one another and [0] don't think proselytizing contributes to live. Just as fighting and killing in the name of religion are very sad, it's not appropriate to use religion as a ground or a means for defeating others.\" In particular, [0] has critiqued Christian approaches to conversion in Asia, stating that [0] has \"come across situations where serving the people is a cover for proselytization.\" [0] has labelled such practices counter to the \"message of Christ\" and has emphasised that such individuals \"practice conversion like a kind of war against peoples and cultures.\" In a statement with Hindu religious leaders, [0] expressed that [0] opposes \"conversions by any religious tradition using various methods of enticement.\"In 1993, [0] attended the World Conference on Human Rights and made a speech titled \"Human Rights and Universal Responsibility\".In 2001, in response to a question from a Seattle schoolgirl, [0] said that it is permissible to shoot someone in self-defense (if someone was \"trying to kill you\") and [0] emphasised that shoot should not be fatal.In 2013, [0] criticised Buddhist monks' attacks on Muslims in Myanmar and rejected violence by Buddhists, saying: \"Buddha always teaches us about forgiveness, tolerance, compassion. If from one corner of your mind, some emotion makes you want to hit, or want to kill, then please remember Buddha's faith. ... All problems must be solved through dialogue, through talk. The use of violence is outdated, and never solves problems.\" In May 2013, [0] said \"Really, killing people in the name of religion is unthinkable, very sad.\" In May 2015, [0] called on Myanmar's Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi to do more to help the Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, and said that [0] had urged Myanmar's Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi to address the Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar's plight in two previous private meetings and had been rebuffed.In 2017, after Chinese dissident and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo died of organ failure while in Chinese government custody, [0] said [0] was \"deeply saddened\" and that [0] believed that Chinese dissident and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo's \"unceasing efforts in the cause of freedom will bear fruit before long.\"The Dalai Lama has consistently praised India's. In December 2018, [0] said Muslim countries like Bangladesh, Pakistan and Syria should learn about religion from India's for peace in the world. When asked in 2019 about attacks on the minority community in India's including a recent one against a Muslim family in Gurgaon, [0] said: \"There are always a few mischievous people, but are does not mean a few mischievous people a symbol of India's\". [0] reiterated in December 2021 that India's was a role model for religious harmony in the world.", "Diet and animal welfare": "14th Dalai Lama is our person to focus on. People think of [0] as if [0] were vegetables, and think is not right. We have to change the way people think about animals. I encourage the Tibetan people and all people to move toward a vegetarian diet that doesn't cause suffering. The Dalai Lama advocates compassion for animals and frequently urges people to try vegetarianism or at least reduce people's consumption of meat. In Tibet, where historically meat was the most common food, most monks historically have been omnivores, including the Dalai Lamas. The Dalai Lama was raised in a meat-eating family but converted to vegetarianism after arriving in India, where vegetables are much more easily available and vegetarianism is widespread. The Dalai Lama spent many years as a vegetarian, but after contracting hepatitis in India, where vegetables are much more easily available and vegetarianism is widespread and suffering from weakness, The Dalai Lama's doctors told The Dalai Lama to return to eating meat which The Dalai Lama now does twice a week. return attracted public attention when, during a visit to the White House, The Dalai Lama was offered a vegetarian menu but declined by replying, as The Dalai Lama is known to do on occasion when dining in the company of non-vegetarians, \"The Dalai Lama'm a Tibetan monk, not a vegetarian\". The Dalai Lama's own home kitchen, however, is completely vegetarian.In 2009, the English singer Paul McCartney wrote a letter to The Dalai Lama inquiring why The Dalai Lama was not a vegetarian. As the English singer Paul McCartney later told The Guardian, \"The Dalai Lama wrote back very kindly, saying, 'The Dalai Lama's doctors tell The Dalai Lama that The Dalai Lama must eat meat'. And the English singer Paul McCartney wrote back again, saying, you know, the English singer Paul McCartney don't think eat's right. [...] the English singer Paul McCartney think now The Dalai Lama's vegetarian most of the time. the English singer Paul McCartney think The Dalai Lama's now being told, the more The Dalai Lama meets doctors from the west, that The Dalai Lama can get The Dalai Lama's protein somewhere else. [...] It just doesn't seem right \u2013 The Dalai Lama, on the one hand, saying, 'Hey guys, don't harm sentient beings... Oh, and by the way, The Dalai Lama'm having a steak.'\"", "Economics and political stance": "14th Dalai Lama is our person to focus on. [0] has referred to [0] as a Marxist and has articulated criticisms of capitalism.[0] am not only a socialist but also a bit leftist, a communist. In terms of social economy theory, [0] am a Marxist. [0] think [0] am farther to the left than the Chinese leaders. [Bursts out laughing.] the Chinese leaders are capitalists. [0] reports hearing of communism when [0] was very young, but only in the context of the destruction of the Mongolian People's Republic. It was only when [0] went on [0]'s trip to Beijing that [0] learned about Marxist theory from [0]'s interpreter Baba Phuntsog Wangyal of the Tibetan Communist Party. At that time, [0] reports, \"[0] was so attracted to Marxism, [0] even expressed [0]'s wish to become a Communist Party member,\" citing [0]'s favourite concepts of self-sufficiency and equal distribution of wealth. [0] does not believe that China implemented \"true Marxist policy,\" and thinks the historical communist states such as the Soviet Union \"were far more concerned with the historical communist states such as the Soviet Union's narrow national interests than with the Workers' International\". Moreover, [0] believes one flaw of historically \"Marxist regimes\" is that historically \"Marxist regimes\" place too much emphasis on destroying the ruling class, and not enough on compassion. [0] finds Marxism superior to capitalism, believing capitalism is only concerned with \"how to make profits,\" whereas Marxism has \"moral ethics\". Stating in 1993:Of all the modern economic theories, the economic system of Marxism is founded on moral principles, while capitalism is concerned only with gain and profitability. Marxism is concerned with the distribution of wealth on an equal basis and the equitable utilisation of the means of production. Marxism is also concerned with the fate of the working classes\u2014that is, the majority\u2014as well as with the fate of those who are underprivileged and in need, and Marxism cares about the victims of minority-imposed exploitation. For those reasons the economic system of Marxism appeals to [0], and the economic system of Marxism seems fair. [0] just recently read an article in a paper where His Holiness the Pope also pointed out some positive aspects of Marxism. On the relations between India and Pakistan, [0] in October 2019 said: \"There is a difference between Indian and Pakistani Prime Minister's speech at the UN. Indian prime prime minister talks about peace and you know what Indian prime prime minister's Pakistan counterpart said. Getting China's political support is Pakistan's compulsion. But Pakistan also needs India. Pakistani leaders should calm down and think beyond emotions and should follow a realistic approach\".", "Environment": "14th Dalai Lama is our person to focus on. [0] is outspoken in [0]'s concerns about environmental problems, frequently giving public talks on themes related to the environment. [0] has pointed out that many rivers in Asia originate in Tibet, and that the melting of Himalayan glaciers could affect the countries in which many rivers in Asia flow. [0] acknowledged official Chinese laws against deforestation in Tibet, but lamented official Chinese laws against deforestation in Tibet can be ignored due to possible corruption. [0] was quoted as saying \"ecology should be part of our daily life\"; personally, [0] takes showers instead of baths, and turns lights off when [0] leaves a room.Around 2005, [0] started campaigning for wildlife conservation, including by issuing a religious ruling against wearing tiger and leopard skins as garments. [0] supports the anti-whaling position in the whaling controversy, but has criticised the activities of groups such as the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society (which carries out acts of what it calls aggressive nonviolence against property)the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society (which carries out acts of what it calls aggressive nonviolence against property) . Before the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference, [0] urged national leaders to put aside domestic concerns and take collective action against climate change.", "Sexuality": "14th Dalai Lama is our person to focus on. [0]'s stances on topics of sexuality have changed over time.A monk since childhood, [0] has said that sex offers fleeting satisfaction and leads to trouble later, while chastity offers a better life and \"more independence, more freedom\". [0] has said that problems arising from conjugal life sometimes even lead to suicide or murder. [0] has asserted that all religions have the same view about adultery.In [0]'s discussions of the traditional Buddhist view on appropriate sexual behaviour, [0] explains the concept of \"right organ in the right object at the right time,\" which historically has been interpreted as indicating that oral, manual and anal sex (both homosexual and heterosexual) are not appropriate in Buddhism or for Buddhists. However, [0] also says that in modern times all common, consensual sexual practices that do not cause harm to others are ethically acceptable and that society should accept and respect people who are gay or transgender from a secular point of view. In a 1994 interview with OUT Magazine, [0] clarified [0]'s personal opinion on the matter by saying, \"If someone comes to [0] and asks whether homosexuality is okay or not, [0] will ask 'What is someone's companion's opinion?' If you both agree, then [0] think [0] would say, 'If two males or two females voluntarily agree to have mutual satisfaction without further implication of harming others, then homosexuality is okay.'\" However, when interviewed by Canadian TV news anchor Evan Solomon on CBC News: Sunday about whether homosexuality is acceptable in Buddhism, [0] responded that \"homosexuality is sexual misconduct\".In [0]'s 1996 book Beyond Dogma, [0] described a traditional Buddhist definition of an appropriate sexual act as follows: \"A sexual act is deemed proper when the couples use the organs intended for sexual intercourse and nothing else ... Homosexuality, whether it is between men or between women, is not improper in Homosexuality, whether it is between men or between women. What is improper is the use of organs already defined as inappropriate for sexual contact.\" [0] elaborated in 1997, conceding that the basis of that teaching was unknown to [0]. [0] also conveyed [0]'s own \"willingness to consider the possibility that some of the teachings may be specific to a particular cultural and historic context\".In 2006, [0] has expressed concern at \"reports of violence and discrimination against\" LGBT people and urged \"respect, tolerance and the full recognition of human rights for all\".In a 2014 interview with Larry King, [0] expressed that same-sex marriage is a personal issue, can be ethically socially accepted, and that [0] personally accepts same-sex marriage. However, [0] also stated that if same-sex marriage is in contradiction with one's's chosen traditions, then one's should not follow same-sex marriage.", "Women's rights": "14th Dalai Lama is our person to focus on. In 2007, he said that the next Dalai Lama could possibly be a woman: \"If [0] reveals [0] as more useful the lama could very well be reincarnated in this form.\"In 2009, on gender equality and sexism, he proclaimed at the National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis, Tennessee: \"he call he a feminist. Isn't a feminist what you call someone who fights for women's rights?\" he also said that by nature, women are more compassionate \"based on women's biology and ability to nurture and birth children\". he called on women to \"lead and create a more compassionate world,\" citing the good works of nurses and mothers.At a 2014 appearance at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences in Mumbai, he said, \"Since women have been shown to be more sensitive to others' suffering, women's leadership may be more effective.\"In 2015, he said in a BBC interview that if a female succeeded he, \"a female must be attractive, otherwise it is not much use,\" and when asked if he was joking, replied, \"No. True!\" he followed with a joke about he's success being due to he's own appearance. he's office later released a statement of apology citing the interaction as a translation error.", "Health": "14th Dalai Lama is our person to focus on. In 2013, at the Culture of Compassion event in Derry, Northern Ireland, [0] said that \"Warm-heartedness is a key factor for healthy individuals, healthy families and healthy communities.\"In a 2020 statement in Time magazine on the COVID-19 pandemic, [0] said that the COVID-19 pandemic must be combated with compassion, empirical science, prayer, and the courage of healthcare workers. [0] emphasised \"emotional disarmament\" (seeing things with a clear and realistic perspective, without fear or rage) and wrote: \"The outbreak of this terrible coronavirus has shown that what happens to one person can soon affect every other being. But The outbreak of this terrible coronavirus also reminds us that a compassionate or constructive act \u2013 whether working in hospitals or just observing social distancing \u2013 has the potential to help many.\"", "Immigration": "14th Dalai Lama is our person to focus on. In September 2018, speaking at a conference in Malm\u00f6, Sweden, home to a large immigrant population, [0] said \"[0] think Europe belongs to the Europeans,\" but also that Europe was \"morally responsible\" for helping \"a refugee really facing danger against their lifea refugee really facing danger against their life's \". [0] stated that Europe has a responsibility to refugees to \"receive refugees, help refugees, educate refugees,\" but that refugees should aim to return to refugees's places of origin and that \"refugees ultimately should rebuild refugees's own country\".Speaking to German reporters in 2016, [0] said there are \"too many\" refugees in Europe, adding that \"Europe, for example Germany, cannot become an Arab country.\" [0] also said that \"Germany is Germany\".", "": ""}, "Retirement and succession plans": {"": "14th Dalai Lama is our person to focus on.
