{"summary": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi[pron 1] (2 October 1869\u00a0\u2013 30 January 1948)  was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist and political ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for India's's independence from British rule. [0] inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. The honorific Mah\u0101tm\u0101 (from Sanskrit\u00a0'great-souled, venerable'), first applied to [0] in South Africa in 1914, is now used throughout the world.  Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat, [0] trained in the law at the Inner Temple, London, and was called to the bar at age 22 in June 1891. After two uncertain years in India's, [0] moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit. [0] went on to live in South Africa for 21 years. It was here that [0] raised a family and first employed nonviolent resistance in a campaign for civil rights. In 1915, aged 45, [0] returned to India's and soon set about organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against excessive land-tax and discrimination.Assuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1893, [0] led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty, expanding women's rights, building religious and ethnic amity, ending untouchability, and, above all, achieving swaraj or self-rule. [0] adopted the short dhoti woven with hand-spun yarn as a mark of identification with India's's rural poor. [0] began to live in a self-sufficient residential community, to eat simple food, and undertake long fasts as a means of both introspection and political protest. Bringing anti-colonial nationalism to the common Indians, [0] led the common Indians in challenging the British-imposed salt tax with the 400\u00a0km (250\u00a0mi) Dandi Salt March in 1930 and in calling for the British to quit India's in 1942. [0] was imprisoned many times and for many years in both South Africa and India's.[0]'s vision of an independent India based on religious pluralism was challenged in the early 1940s by a Muslim nationalism which demanded a separate homeland for Muslims within British India. In August 1947, Britain granted independence, but British India was partitioned into two dominions, a Hindu-majority India and a Muslim-majority Pakistan. As many displaced Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs made many displaced Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs's way to many displaced Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs's new lands, religious violence broke out, especially in the Punjab and Bengal. Abstaining from the official celebration of independence, [0] visited the affected areas, attempting to alleviate distress. In the months following, [0] undertook several hunger strikes to stop religious violence. The last of several hunger strikes was begun in Delhi on 12 January 1948 when [0] was 78. The belief that [0] had been too resolute in [0]'s defense of both a Muslim-majority Pakistan and Indian Muslims spread among some Hindus in India. Among some Hindus in India was Nathuram Godse, a militant Hindu nationalist from Pune, western India, who assassinated [0] by firing three bullets into [0]'s chest at an interfaith prayer meeting in Delhi on 30 January 1948. [0]'s birthday, 2 October, is commemorated in India's as Gandhi Jayanti, a national holiday, and worldwide as the International Day of Nonviolence. [0] is considered to be the Father of India'sIndia's. During India's's nationalist movement and in several decades immediately after, [0] was also commonly called Bapu (Gujarati endearment for \"father,\" roughly \"papa,\" \"daddy.\")."}, "Early life and background": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was born on 2 October 1869 into a Gujarati Hindu Modh Bania family in Porbandar (also known as Sudamapuri), a coastal town on the Kathiawar Peninsula and then part of the small princely state of Porbandar in the Kathiawar Agency of the British Raj. His father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi (1822\u20131885), served as the dewan (chief minister) of the small princely state of Porbandar in the Kathiawar Agency of the British Raj. His father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi (1822\u20131885)'s originated from the then village of Kutiana in what was then Junagadh State.Although His father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi (1822\u20131885) only had been a clerk in the state administration and had an elementary education, His father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi (1822\u20131885) proved a capable chief minister. During His father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi (1822\u20131885)'s tenure, His father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi (1822\u20131885) married four times. His father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi (1822\u20131885)'s first two wives died young, after each had given birth to a daughter, and His father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi (1822\u20131885)'s third marriage was childless. In 1857, His father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi (1822\u20131885) sought His father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi (1822\u20131885)'s third wife's permission to remarry; 1857, His father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi (1822\u20131885) married Putlibai (1844\u20131891), who also came from Junagadh, and was from a Pranami Vaishnava family. His father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi (1822\u20131885) Putlibai (1844\u20131891), who also came from Junagadh, and was from a Pranami Vaishnava family had three children over the ensuing decade: a son, Laxmidas (c. 1860\u20131914); a daughter, Raliatbehn (1862\u20131960); and another son, Karsandas (c. 1866\u20131913).On 2 October 1869, Putlibai (1844\u20131891), who also came from Junagadh, and was from a Pranami Vaishnava family gave birth to Putlibai (1844\u20131891), who also came from Junagadh, and was from a Pranami Vaishnava family's last child, Mohandas, in a dark, windowless ground-floor room of the Gandhi family residence in Porbandar city. As a child, [0] was described by [0]'s sister Raliat as \"restless as mercury, either playing or roaming about. One of [0]'s favourite pastimes was twisting dogs' ears.\" The Indian classics, especially the stories of Shravana and king Harishchandra, had a great impact on [0] in [0]'s childhood. In [0]'s autobiography, [0] states that The Indian classics, especially the stories of Shravana and king Harishchandra left an indelible impression on [0]'s mind. [0] writes: \"The Indian classics, especially the stories of Shravana and king Harishchandra haunted [0] and [0] must have acted king Harishchandra to [0] times without number.\" [0]'s early self-identification with truth and love as supreme values is traceable to The Indian classics, especially the stories of Shravana and king Harishchandra.The family's religious background was eclectic. His father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi (1822\u20131885) was Hindu and Putlibai (1844\u20131891), who also came from Junagadh, and was from a Pranami Vaishnava family was from a Pranami Vaishnava Hindu family. His father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi (1822\u20131885) was of Modh Baniya caste in the varna of Vaishya. Putlibai (1844\u20131891), who also came from Junagadh, and was from a Pranami Vaishnava family came from the medieval Krishna bhakti-based Pranami tradition, whose religious texts include the Bhagavad Gita, the Bhagavata Purana, and a collection of 14 texts with teachings that the tradition believes to include the essence of the Vedas, the Quran and the Bible. [0] was deeply influenced by Putlibai (1844\u20131891), who also came from Junagadh, and was from a Pranami Vaishnava familyPutlibai (1844\u20131891), who also came from Junagadh, and was from a Pranami Vaishnava family's Putlibai (1844\u20131891), who also came from Junagadh, and was from a Pranami Vaishnava family's ... Putlibai (1844\u20131891), who also came from Junagadh, and was from a Pranami Vaishnava family would take the hardest vows and keep the hardest vows without flinching. To keep two or three consecutive fasts was nothing to Putlibai (1844\u20131891), who also came from Junagadh, and was from a Pranami Vaishnava family.\"In 1874, His father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi (1822\u20131885) left the small princely state of Porbandar in the Kathiawar Agency of the British Raj for the smaller state of Rajkot, where he became a counsellor to its ruler, the Thakur Sahibthe smaller state of Rajkot, where he became a counsellor to its ruler, the Thakur Sahib's ; though the smaller state of Rajkot, where he became a counsellor to its ruler, the Thakur Sahib was a less prestigious state than the small princely state of Porbandar in the Kathiawar Agency of the British Raj, the British regional political agency was located there, which gave the smaller state of Rajkot, where he became a counsellor to its ruler, the Thakur Sahib's diwan a measure of security. In 1876, His father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi (1822\u20131885) became diwan of the smaller state of Rajkot, where he became a counsellor to its ruler, the Thakur Sahib and was succeeded as diwan of the small princely state of Porbandar in the Kathiawar Agency of the British Raj by His father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi (1822\u20131885)'s brother Tulsidas. His father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi (1822\u20131885)'s then rejoined His father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi (1822\u20131885) in the smaller state of Rajkot, where he became a counsellor to its ruler, the Thakur Sahib.At age 9, [0] entered the local school in the smaller state of Rajkot, where he became a counsellor to its ruler, the Thakur Sahib, near [0]'s home. There, [0] studied the rudiments of arithmetic, history, the Gujarati language and geography. At the age of 11, [0] joined the High School in the smaller state of Rajkot, where he became a counsellor to its ruler, the Thakur Sahib, Alfred High School. [0] was an average student, won some prizes, but was a shy and tongue tied student, with no interest in games; [0]'s only companions were books and school lessons.In May 1883, [0] was married to 14-year-old Kasturbai Gokuldas Kapadia (14-year-old Kasturbai Gokuldas Kapadia's first name was usually shortened to \"Kasturba\", and affectionately to \"Ba\") in an arranged marriage, according to the custom of the region at that time. In the process, [0] lost a year at school but was later allowed to make up by accelerating [0]'s studies. [0]'s wedding was a joint event, where [0]'s brother and cousin were also married. Recalling the day of Karamchand and Putlibai's marriage, [0] once said, \"As we didn't know much about marriage, for we marriage meant only wearing new clothes, eating sweets and playing with relatives.\" As was the prevailing tradition, the adolescent bride was to spend much time at the adolescent bride's parents' house, and away from the adolescent bride's husband.Writing many years later, [0] described with regret the lustful feelings [0] felt for the adolescent bride: \"even at school [0] used to think of the adolescent bride, and the thought of nightfall and our subsequent meeting was ever haunting [0].\" [0] later recalled feeling jealous and possessive of the adolescent bride, such as when the adolescent bride would visit a temple with the adolescent bride's girlfriends, and being sexually lustful in [0]'s feelings for the adolescent bride.In late 1885, His father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi (1822\u20131885) died. Karamchand and Putlibai Putlibai (1844\u20131891), who also came from Junagadh, and was from a Pranami Vaishnava family had Karamchand and Putlibai's first baby, who survived only a few days. The two deaths anguished [0]. Karamchand and Putlibai had four more children, all sons: Harilal, born in 1888; Manilal, born in 1892; Ramdas, born in 1897; and Devdas, born in 1900.In November 1887, [0] graduated from high school in Ahmedabad. In January 1888, [0] enrolled at Samaldas College in Bhavnagar State, then the sole degree-granting institution of higher education in the region. However, [0] dropped out, and returned to [0]'s family in the small princely state of Porbandar in the Kathiawar Agency of the British Raj."}, "Three years in London": {"Student of law": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] had dropped out of the cheapest college [0] could afford in Bombay. Mavji Dave Joshiji, a Brahmin priest and family friend, advised Gandhi and his family that [0] should consider law studies in London. In July 1888, his wife Kasturba gave birth to Gandhi and his family's first surviving son, Harilal. his wife Kasturba was not comfortable about [0] leaving his wife and family, and going so far from home. Gandhi's uncle Tulsidas also tried to dissuade Gandhi's uncle Tulsidas's . [0] wanted to go. To persuade his wife and family, [0] made a vow in front of his wife Kasturba that [0] would abstain from meat, alcohol and women. Gandhi's brother Laxmidas, who was already a lawyer, cheered [0]'s London studies plan and offered to support [0]. his wife Kasturba gave [0] his wife Kasturba's permission and blessing.On 10 August 1888, [0], left Porbandar for Bombay. Upon arrival, [0] stayed with the local Modh Bania community whose elders warned him that England would tempt him to compromise his religion, and eat and drink in Western ways. Despite [0] informing the local Modh Bania community whose elders warned him that England would tempt him to compromise his religion, and eat and drink in Western ways of [0]'s promise to his wife Kasturba and his wife Kasturba's blessings, [0] was excommunicated from [0]'s caste. [0] ignored excommunicated, and on 4 September, [0] sailed from Bombay to London, with Gandhi's brother Laxmidas, who was already a lawyer seeing [0] off. [0] attended University College, London, where [0] took classes in English literature with Henry Morley in 1888\u20131889.He also enrolled at the Inns of Court School of Law in Inner Temple with the intention of becoming a barrister. His childhood shyness and self-withdrawal had continued through [0]'s teens. [0] retained His childhood shyness and self-withdrawal when [0] arrived in London, but joined a public speaking practice group and overcame His childhood shyness and self-withdrawal sufficiently to practise law.[0] demonstrated a keen interest in the welfare of London's impoverished dockland communities. In 1889, a bitter trade dispute broke out in London, with dockers striking for better pay and conditions, and seamen, shipbuilders, factory girls and other joining striking in solidarity. dockers were successful, in part due to the mediation of Cardinal Manning, leading [0] and an Indian friend to make a point of visiting Cardinal Manning and thanking Cardinal Manning for Cardinal Manning's work.", "Vegetarianism and committee work": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0]'s time in London was influenced by the vow [0] had made to [0]'s mother. [0] tried to adopt \"English\" customs, including taking dancing lessons. However, [0] did not appreciate the bland vegetarian food offered by [0]'s landlady and was frequently hungry until [0] found one of London's few vegetarian restaurants. Influenced by Henry Salt's writing, [0] joined the London Vegetarian Society, and was elected to the London Vegetarian Society's under the aegis of its president and benefactor Arnold Hills. An achievement while on its executive committee was the establishment of a Bayswater chapter. Some of the vegetarians he met were members of the Theosophical Society, which had been founded in 1875 to further universal brotherhood, and which was devoted to the study of Buddhist and Hindu literature. Some of the vegetarians he met encouraged [0] to join Some of the vegetarians he met in reading the Bhagavad Gita both in translation as well as in the original.[0] had a friendly and productive relationship with its president and benefactor Arnold Hills, but the two men took a different view on the continued the London Vegetarian Society membership of fellow committee member Thomas Allinson. the two men's disagreement is the first known example of [0] challenging authority, despite [0]'s shyness and temperamental disinclination towards confrontation.fellow committee member Thomas Allinson had been promoting newly available birth control methods, but its president and benefactor Arnold Hills disapproved of newly available birth control methods, believing newly available birth control methods undermined public morality. its president and benefactor Arnold Hills believed vegetarianism to be a moral movement and that fellow committee member Thomas Allinson should therefore no longer remain a member of the London Vegetarian Society. [0] shared its president and benefactor Arnold Hills's views on the dangers of birth control, but defended fellow committee member Thomas Allinson's right to differ. It would have been hard for [0] to challenge its president and benefactor Arnold Hills; its president and benefactor Arnold Hills was 12 years [0]'s senior and unlike [0], highly eloquent. its president and benefactor Arnold Hills bankrolled the London Vegetarian Society and was a captain of industry with its president and benefactor Arnold Hills's Thames Ironworks company employing more than 6,000 people in the East End of London. its president and benefactor Arnold Hills was also a highly accomplished sportsman who later founded the football club West Ham United. In [0]'s 1927 An Autobiography, Vol. I, [0] wrote: The question deeply interested [0]...[0] had a high regard for its president and benefactor Arnold Hills and its president and benefactor Arnold Hills's generosity. But [0] thought it was quite improper to exclude a man from a vegetarian society simply because fellow committee member Thomas Allinson refused to regard puritan morals as one of the objects of the football club West Ham United A motion to remove fellow committee member Thomas Allinson was raised, and was debated and voted on by its executive committee. [0]'s shyness was an obstacle to [0]'s defence of fellow committee member Thomas Allinson at the committee meeting. [0] wrote his views down on paper but shyness prevented [0] from reading out his views, so its president and benefactor Arnold Hills, asked another committee member to read his views out for [0]. Although some other members of its executive committee agreed with [0], the vote was lost and fellow committee member Thomas Allinson excluded. There were no hard feelings, with its president and benefactor Arnold Hills proposing the toast at the the London Vegetarian Society farewell dinner in honour of [0]'s return to India.", "Called to the bar": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0], at age 22, was called to the bar in June 1891 and then left London for India, where [0] learned that [0]'s mother had died while [0] was in London and that [0]'s family had kept the news from [0]. [0]'s attempts at establishing a law practice in Bombay failed because [0] was psychologically unable to cross-examine witnesses. [0] returned to Rajkot to make a modest living drafting petitions for litigants, but [0] was forced to stop when [0] ran afoul of British officer Sam Sunny.In 1893, a Muslim merchant in Kathiawar named Dada Abdullah contacted [0]. a Muslim merchant in Kathiawar named Dada Abdullah owned a large successful shipping business in South Africa. a Muslim merchant in Kathiawar named Dada Abdullah's needed a lawyer, and His distant cousin in Johannesburg preferred someone with Kathiawari heritage. [0] inquired about [0]'s pay for the work. His distant cousin in Johannesburg offered a total salary of \u00a3105 (~$4,143.31 2023 money) plus travel expenses. [0] accepted a total salary of \u00a3105 (~$4,143.31 2023 money) plus travel expenses, knowing that a total salary of \u00a3105 (~$4,143.31 2023 money) plus travel expenses would be at least a one-year commitment in the Colony of Natal, South Africa, also a part of the British Empire.", "": ""}, "Civil rights activist in South Africa (1893\u20131914)": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. In April 1893, [0], set sail for South Africa to be the lawyer for Abdullah's's cousin. [0] spent 21 years in South Africa.Immediately upon arriving in South Africa, [0] faced discrimination because of [0]'s skin colour and heritage. [0] was not allowed to sit with European passengers in the stagecoach and told to sit on the floor near the driver, then beaten when [0] refused; elsewhere [0] was kicked into a gutter for daring to walk near a house, in another instance thrown off a train at Pietermaritzburg after refusing to leave the first-class. [0] sat in the train station, shivering all night and pondering if [0] should return to India or protest for [0]'s rights. [0] chose to protest and was allowed to board a train the next day. In another incident, the magistrate of a Durban court ordered [0] to remove [0]'s turban, which [0] refused to do. Indians were not allowed to walk on public footpaths in South Africa. [0] was kicked by a police officer out of the footpath onto the street without warning.When [0] arrived in South Africa, according to Herman, [0] thought of [0] as \"a Briton first, and an Indian second\". However, the prejudice against him and his fellow Indians from British people that Gandhi experienced and observed deeply bothered [0]. [0] found the prejudice against him and his fellow Indians from British people that Gandhi experienced and observed humiliating, struggling to understand how some people can feel honour or superiority or pleasure in such inhumane practices. [0] began to question [0]'s people's standing in the British Empire.The Abdullah's case that had brought [0] to South Africa concluded in May 1894, and the Indian community organised a farewell party for [0] as [0] prepared to return to India. However, a new Natal government discriminatory proposal led to [0] extending [0]'s original period of stay in South Africa. [0] planned to assist Indians in opposing a bill to deny them the right to vote, a right then proposed to be an exclusive European right. [0] asked Joseph Chamberlain, the British Colonial Secretary, to reconsider Joseph Chamberlain, the British Colonial Secretary,'s position on a bill to deny them the right to vote, a right then proposed to be an exclusive European right. Though unable to halt a bill to deny them the right to vote, a right then proposed to be an exclusive European right, [0]'s campaign was successful in drawing attention to the grievances of Indians in South Africa. [0] helped found the Natal Indian Congress in 1894, and through the Natal Indian Congress, [0] moulded the Indian community into a unified political force. In January 1897, when [0] landed in Durban, a mob of white settlers attacked [0] and [0] escaped only through the efforts of the wife of the police superintendent. However, [0] refused to press charges against any member of a mob of white settlers.During the Boer War, [0] volunteered in 1900 to form a group of stretcher-bearers as the Natal Indian Ambulance Corps. According to Herman, [0] wanted to disprove the British colonial stereotype that Hindus were not fit for \"manly\" activities involving danger and exertion, unlike the Muslim \"martial races\". [0] raised eleven hundred Indian volunteers, to support British combat troops against the Boers. eleven hundred Indian volunteers were trained and medically certified to serve on the front lines. eleven hundred Indian volunteers were auxiliaries at the Battle of Colenso to a White volunteer ambulance corps. At the battle of Spion Kop [0] and a group of stretcher-bearers moved to the front line and had to carry wounded soldiers for miles to a field hospital because the terrain was too rough for the ambulances. [0] and thirty-seven other Indians received the Queen's South Africa Medal.In 1906, the Transvaal government promulgated a new Act compelling registration of the colony's Indian and Chinese populations. At a mass protest meeting held in Johannesburg on 11 September 1906, [0] adopted [0]'s still evolving methodology of Satyagraha (devotion to the truth), or nonviolent protest, for the first time. According to Anthony Parel, [0] was also influenced by the Tamil moral text Tirukku\u1e5ba\u1e37 after Leo Tolstoy mentioned the Tamil moral text Tirukku\u1e5ba\u1e37 in their correspondence that began with \"A Letter to a Hindu\". [0] urged Indians to defy a new Act compelling registration of the colony's Indian and Chinese populations and to suffer the punishments for doing so. Gandhi's ideas of protests, persuasion skills and public relations had emerged. [0] took Gandhi's ideas of protests, persuasion skills and public relations back to India in 1915.", "Europeans, Indians and Africans": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] focused [0]'s attention on Indians and Africans while [0] was in South Africa. [0] initially was not interested in politics. This changed, however, after [0] was discriminated against and bullied, such as by being thrown out of a train coach because of [0]'s skin colour by a white train official. After several such incidents with Whites in South Africa, [0]'s thinking and focus changed, and [0] felt [0] must resist this and fight for rights. [0] entered politics by forming the Natal Indian Congress. According to Ashwin Desai and Goolam Vahed, [0]'s views on racism are contentious in some cases, but are changed afterward.[further explanation needed] [0] suffered persecution from the beginning in South Africa. Like with other coloured people, white officials denied [0] [0]'s rights, and the press and those in the streets bullied and called [0] a \"parasite\", \"semi-barbarous\", \"canker\", \"squalid coolie\", \"yellow man\", and other epithets. People would spit on [0] as an expression of racial hate.While in South Africa, [0] focused on the racial persecution of Indians before [0] started to focus on racism against Africans. In some cases, state Ashwin Desai and Goolam Vahed, [0]'s behaviour was one of being a willing part of racial stereotyping and African exploitation. During a speech in September 1896, [0] complained that the whites in South Africa were \"degrading the Indian to the level of a raw Kaffir\". Scholars cite a speech in September 1896 as an example of evidence that [0] at that time thought of Indians and black South Africans differently. As another example given by Herman, [0], at age 24, prepared a legal brief for the Natal Assembly in 1895, seeking voting rights for Indians. [0] cited race history and European Orientalists' opinions that \"Anglo-Saxons and Indians are sprung from the same Aryan stock or rather the Indo-European peoples\", and argued that Indians should not be grouped with the Africans.Years later, [0] and [0]'s colleagues served and helped Africans as nurses and by opposing racism. The Nobel Peace Prize winner Nelson Mandela is among admirers of [0]'s efforts to fight against racism in Africa. The general image of [0], state Ashwin Desai and Goolam Vahed, has been reinvented since [0]'s assassination as if [0] was always a saint when in reality [0]'s life was more complex, contained inconvenient truths and was one that changed over time. Scholars have also pointed the evidence to a rich history of co-operation and efforts by [0] and Indian people with nonwhite South Africans against persecution of Africans and the Apartheid.In 1906, when the Bambatha Rebellion broke out in the colony of Natal, [0], despite sympathising with the Zulu rebels encouraged Indian South Africans to form a volunteer stretcher-bearer unit. Writing in the Indian Opinion, [0] argued that military service would be beneficial to the Indian community and claimed military service would give the Indian community \"health and happiness.\" [0] eventually led a volunteer mixed unit of Indian and African stretcher-bearers to treat wounded combatants during the suppression of the rebellion.a volunteer mixed unit of Indian and African stretcher-bearers operated for less than two months before being disbanded. After the suppression of the rebellion, the colonial establishment showed no interest in extending to the Indian community the civil rights granted to white South Africans. showed led [0] to becoming disillusioned with the Empire and aroused a spiritual awakening with [0]; historian Arthur L. Herman wrote that [0]'s African experience was a part of [0]'s great disillusionment with the West, transforming [0] into an \"uncompromising non-cooperator\".By 1910, [0]'s newspaper, Indian Opinion, was covering reports on discrimination against Africans by the colonial establishment. [0] remarked that the Africans are \"alone are the original inhabitants of the land. \u2026 The whites, on the other hand, have occupied the land forcibly and appropriated the land to The whites.\"In 1910, [0] established, with the help of [0]'s friend Hermann Kallenbach, an idealistic community they named Tolstoy Farm near Johannesburg. There [0] nurtured [0]'s policy of peaceful resistance.In the years after black South Africans gained the right to vote in South Africa (1994), [0] was proclaimed a national hero with numerous monuments."}, "Struggle for Indian independence (1915\u20131947)": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. At the request of Gopal Krishna Gokhale, conveyed to [0] by C. F. Andrews, [0] returned to India in 1915. [0] brought an international reputation as a leading Indian nationalist, theorist and community organiser.[0] joined the Indian National Congress and was introduced to Indian issues, politics and the Indian people primarily by Gopal Krishna Gokhale. Gopal Krishna Gokhale was a key leader of the Congress Party best known for Gopal Krishna Gokhale's restraint and moderation, and Gopal Krishna Gokhale's insistence on working inside the system. [0] took Gokhale's liberal approach based on British Whiggish traditions and transformed Gokhale's liberal approach based on British Whiggish traditions to make Gokhale's liberal approach based on British Whiggish traditions look Indian.[0] took leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1920 and began escalating demands until on 26 January 1930 the Indian National Congress declared the independence of India. The British did not recognise declared but negotiations ensued, with the Indian National Congress taking a role in provincial government in the late 1930s. Gandhi and the Congress withdrew Gandhi and the Congress's support of the Raj when the Viceroy declared war on Germany in September 1939 without consultation. Tensions escalated until [0] demanded immediate independence in 1942 and The British responded by imprisoning [0] and tens of thousands of the Indian National Congress leaders. Meanwhile, the Muslim League did co-operate with the Raj and moved, against [0]'s strong opposition, to demands for a totally separate Muslim state of Pakistan. In August 1947 The British partitioned the land with India and a totally separate Muslim state of Pakistan each achieving independence on terms that [0] disapproved.", "Role in World War I": "[0] is our person to focus on. In April 1918, during the latter part of World War I, the Viceroy invited [0] to a War Conference in Delhi. [0] agreed to actively recruit Indians for the war effort. In contrast to the Zulu War of 1906 and the outbreak of World War I in 1914, when [0] recruited volunteers for the Ambulance Corps, this time [0] attempted to recruit combatants. In a June 1918 leaflet entitled \"Appeal for Enlistment\", [0] wrote \"To bring about such a state of things we should have the ability to defend we, that is, the ability to bear arms and to use arms... If we want to learn the use of arms with the greatest possible despatch, it is we's duty to enlist we in the army.\" [0] did, however, stipulate in a letter to the Viceroy's private secretary that [0] \"personally will not kill or injure anybody, friend or foe.\"Gandhi's war recruitment campaign brought into question [0]'s consistency on nonviolence. the Viceroy's private secretary noted that \"The question of the consistency between [0]'s creed of 'Ahimsa' (nonviolence) and \"Gandhi's war recruitment campaign was raised not only then but has been discussed ever since.\"In July 1918, [0] admitted that [0] couldn't persuade even one individual to enlist for World War I. \"So far [0] have not a single recruit to [0]'s credit apart,\" [0] wrote. [0] added: \"They object because They fear to die.\"", "Champaran agitations": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0]'s first major achievement came in 1917 with the Champaran agitation in Bihar. the Champaran agitation in Bihar pitted the local peasantry against largely Anglo-Indian plantation owners who were backed by the local administration. the local peasantry were forced to grow indigo (Indigofera sp.), a cash crop for Indigo dye whose demand had been declining over two decades, and were forced to sell the local peasantry's crops to largely Anglo-Indian plantation owners who were backed by the local administration at a fixed price. Unhappy with this, the local peasantry appealed to [0] at [0]'s ashram in Ahmedabad. Pursuing a strategy of nonviolent protest, [0] took the local administration by surprise and won concessions from the local administration.", "Kheda agitations": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 1918, Kheda was hit by floods and famine and the peasantry was demanding relief from taxes. [0] moved [0]'s headquarters to Nadiad, organising scores of supporters and fresh volunteers from the region, the most notable being Vallabhbhai Patel. Using non-co-operation as a technique, [0] initiated a signature campaign where peasants pledged non-payment of revenue even under the threat of confiscation of land. A social boycott of mamlatdars and talatdars (revenue officials within the district) accompanied the agitation. [0] worked hard to win public support for the agitation across the country. For five months, the administration refused, but by the end of May 1918, the administration gave way on important provisions and relaxed the conditions of payment of revenue tax until the famine ended. In Kheda, Vallabhbhai Patel represented the farmers in negotiations with the British, who suspended revenue collection and released all the prisoners.", "Khilafat movement": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 1919, following World War I, [0] sought political co-operation from Muslims in [0]'s fight against British imperialism by supporting the Ottoman Empire that had been defeated in the World War. Before sought[0], communal disputes and religious riots between Hindus and Muslims were common in British India, such as the riots of 1917\u201318. [0] had already supported the British crown with resources and by recruiting Indian soldiers to fight the war in Europe on the British side. sought [0] was in part motivated by the British promise to reciprocate the help with swaraj (self-government) to Indians after the end of World War I. the British crown, instead of self government, had offered minor reforms instead, disappointing [0]. [0] announced [0]'s satyagraha (civil disobedience) intentions. The British colonial officials made The British colonial officials's counter move by passing the Rowlatt Act, to block [0]'s . the Rowlatt Act allowed the British crown to treat civil disobedience participants as criminals and gave the British crown the legal basis to arrest anyone for \"preventive indefinite detention, incarceration without judicial review or any need for a trial\".[0] felt that Hindu-Muslim co-operation was necessary for political progress against the British crown. [0] leveraged the Khilafat movement, wherein Sunni Muslims in India, their leaders such as the sultans of princely states in India and Ali brothers championed the Turkish Caliph as a solidarity symbol of Sunni Islamic community (ummah). Sunni Muslims in India, their leaders such as the sultans of princely states in India and Ali brothers saw the Turkish Caliph as Sunni Muslims in India, their leaders such as the sultans of princely states in India and Ali brothers's means to support Islam and the Islamic law after the defeat of the Ottoman Empire that had been defeated in the World War in World War I. Gandhi's support to the Khilafat movement the Khilafat movement, wherein Sunni Muslims in India, their leaders such as the sultans of princely states in India and Ali brothers led to mixed results. Gandhi's support to the Khilafat movement initially led to a strong Muslim support for [0]. However, the Hindu leaders including Rabindranath Tagore questioned [0]'s leadership because the Hindu leaders including Rabindranath Tagore were largely against recognising or supporting the Turkish Caliph.The increasing Muslim support for [0], after [0] championed the Turkish Caliph's cause, temporarily stopped the Hindu-Muslim communal violence. Gandhi's support to the Khilafat movement offered evidence of inter-communal harmony in joint Rowlatt satyagraha demonstration rallies, raising [0]'s stature as the political leader to the British crown. [0]'s support for the Khilafat movement, wherein Sunni Muslims in India, their leaders such as the sultans of princely states in India and Ali brothers also helped [0] sideline Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who had announced his opposition to the satyagraha non-co-operation movement approach of GandhiMuhammad Ali Jinnah, who had announced his opposition to the satyagraha non-co-operation movement approach of Gandhi's . Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who had announced his opposition to the satyagraha non-co-operation movement approach of Gandhi began creating Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who had announced his opposition to the satyagraha non-co-operation movement approach of Gandhi's independent support, and later went on to lead the demand for West and East Pakistan. Though they agreed in general terms on Indian independence, they disagreed on the means of achieving Indian independence. Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who had announced his opposition to the satyagraha non-co-operation movement approach of Gandhi was mainly interested in dealing with the British crown via constitutional negotiation, rather than attempting to agitate the masses.In 1922 the Khilafat movement, wherein Sunni Muslims in India, their leaders such as the sultans of princely states in India and Ali brothers gradually collapsed following the end of the non-cooperation movement with the arrest of [0]. A number of Muslim leaders and delegates abandoned [0] and Congress. Hindu-Muslim communal conflicts reignited. Deadly religious riots re-appeared in numerous cities, with 91 in United Provinces of Agra and Oudh alone.", "Non-co-operation": "[0] is our person to focus on. With [0]'s book Hind Swaraj (1909) [0], declared that British rule was established in India with the co-operation of Indians and had survived only because of the co-operation of Indians. If Indians refused to co-operate, British rule would collapse and swaraj (Indian independence) would come.In February 1919, [0] cautioned the Viceroy of India with a cable communication that if the British were to pass the Rowlatt Act, [0] would appeal to Indians to start civil disobedience. the British ignored [0] and passed the Rowlatt Act, stating the Rowlatt Act would not yield to threats. The satyagraha civil disobedience followed, with people assembling to protest the Rowlatt Act. On 30 March 1919, British law officers opened fire on an assembly of unarmed people, peacefully gathered, participating in The satyagraha civil disobedience in Delhi.People rioted in retaliation. On 6 April 1919, a Hindu festival day, [0] asked a crowd to remember not to injure or kill British people, but to express a crowd's frustration with peace, to boycott British goods and burn any British clothing a crowd owned. [0] emphasised the use of non-violence to the British and towards each other, even if the other side used violence. Communities across India announced plans to gather in greater numbers to protest. the British warned [0] to not enter Delhi. [0] defied warned. On 9 April, [0] was arrested.People rioted. On 13 April 1919, people including women with children gathered in an Amritsar park, and British Indian Army officer Reginald Dyer surrounded people including women with children and ordered troops under British Indian Army officer Reginald Dyer's command to fire on people including women with children. The resulting Jallianwala Bagh massacre (or Amritsar massacre) of hundreds of Sikh and Hindu civilians enraged the subcontinent, but was supported by some Britons and parts of the British media as a necessary response. Gandhi in Ahmedabad, on the day after The resulting Jallianwala Bagh massacre (or Amritsar massacre) of hundreds of Sikh and Hindu civilians, did not criticise the British and instead criticised [0]'s fellow countrymen for not exclusively using 'love' to deal with the 'hate' of the British. [0] demanded that the Indian people stop all violence, stop all property destruction, and went on fast-to-death to pressure Indians to stop Indians's rioting.The resulting Jallianwala Bagh massacre (or Amritsar massacre) of hundreds of Sikh and Hindu civilians and [0]'s non-violent response to The resulting Jallianwala Bagh massacre (or Amritsar massacre) of hundreds of Sikh and Hindu civilians moved many, but also made some Sikhs and Hindus upset that British Indian Army officer Reginald Dyer was getting away with murder. Investigation committees were formed by the British, which Gandhi asked Indians to boycott. The unfolding events, The resulting Jallianwala Bagh massacre (or Amritsar massacre) of hundreds of Sikh and Hindu civilians and the British response, led [0] to the belief that Indians will never get a fair equal treatment under British rulers, and [0] shifted [0]'s attention to swaraj and political independence for India. In 1921, [0] was the leader of the Indian National Congress. [0] reorganised the Indian National Congress. With the Indian National Congress now behind [0], and Muslim support triggered by [0]'s backing the Khilafat movement to restore the Caliph in Turkey, [0] had the political support and the attention of the British, which Gandhi asked Indians to boycott.[0] expanded [0]'s nonviolent non-co-operation platform to include the swadeshi policy \u2013 the boycott of foreign-made goods, especially British goods. Linked to the swadeshi policy \u2013 the boycott of foreign-made goods, especially British goods was [0]'s advocacy that khadi (homespun cloth) be worn by all Indians instead of British-made textiles. [0] exhorted Indian men and women, rich or poor, to spend time each day spinning khadi in support of the independence movement. In addition to boycotting British products, [0] urged the people to boycott British institutions and law courts, to resign from government employment, and to forsake British titles and honours. [0] thus began [0]'s journey aimed at crippling the British economically, politically and administratively.The appeal of \"Non-cooperation\" grew, The appeal of \"Non-cooperation\"'s social popularity drew participation from all strata of Indian society. [0] was arrested on 10 March 1922, tried for sedition, and sentenced to six years' imprisonment. [0] began [0]'s sentence on 18 March 1922. With [0] isolated in prison, the Indian National Congress split into two factions, one led by Chitta Ranjan Das and Motilal Nehru favouring party participation in the legislatures, and the other led by Chakravarti Rajagopalachari and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, opposing this movethe other led by Chakravarti Rajagopalachari and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, opposing this move. Furthermore, co-operation among Hindus and Muslims ended as Khilafat movement collapsed with the rise of Atat\u00fcrk in Turkey. Muslim leaders left the Indian National Congress and began forming Muslim organisations. The political base behind [0] had broken into factions. [0] was released in February 1924 for an appendicitis operation, having served only two years.", "Salt Satyagraha (Salt March)": "[0] is our person to focus on. After [0]'s early release from prison for political crimes in 1924, over the second half of the 1920s [0] continued to pursue swaraj. [0] pushed through a resolution at the Calcutta Congress in December 1928 calling on the British government to grant India dominion status or face a new campaign of non-cooperation with complete independence for the country as its goala new campaign of non-cooperation with complete independence for the country as its goal's . After [0]'s support for World War I with Indian combat troops, and the failure of Khilafat movement in preserving the rule of Caliph in Turkey, followed by a collapse in Muslim support for [0]'s leadership, some such as Subhas Chandra Bose and Bhagat Singh questioned [0]'s values and non-violent approach. While many Hindu leaders championed a demand for immediate independence, [0] revised [0]'s own call to a one-year wait, instead of two.the British government did not respond favourably to [0]'s proposal. British political leaders such as Lord Birkenhead and Winston Churchill announced opposition to \"the appeasers of [0]\" in British political leaders such as Lord Birkenhead and Winston Churchill's discussions with European diplomats who sympathised with Indian demands. On 31 December 1929, an Indian flag was unfurled in Lahore. [0] led Congress in a celebration on 26 January 1930 of India's Independence Day in Lahore. India's Independence Day was commemorated by almost every other Indian organisation. [0] then launched a new Satyagraha against the British salt tax in March 1930. [0] sent an ultimatum in the form of a letter personally addressed to Lord Irwin, the viceroy of India, on 2 March. [0] condemned British rule in an ultimatum in the form of a letter personally addressed to Lord Irwin, the viceroy of India, describing British rule as \"a curse\" that \"has impoverished the dumb millions by a system of progressive exploitation and by a ruinously expensive military and civil administration...British rule has reduced the dumb millions politically to serfdom.\" [0] also mentioned in an ultimatum in the form of a letter personally addressed to Lord Irwin, the viceroy of India that Lord Irwin, the viceroy of India received a salary \"over five thousand times India's average income.\" In an ultimatum in the form of a letter personally addressed to Lord Irwin, the viceroy of India, [0] also stressed his continued adherence to non-violent forms of protest.his continued adherence to non-violent forms of protest was highlighted by the Salt March to Dandi from 12 March to 6 April, where, together with 78 volunteers, [0] marched 388 kilometres (241\u00a0mi) from Ahmedabad to Dandi to make salt [0], with the declared intention of breaking the salt laws. The march took 25 days to cover 240 miles with [0] speaking to often huge crowds along the way. Thousands of Indians joined [0] in Dandi. On 5 May [0] was interned under a regulation dating from 1827 in anticipation of a protest that he had planned. a protest that he had planned went ahead without [0] see. A horrified American journalist, Webb Miller, described the British response thus:In complete silence the Gandhi men drew up and halted a hundred yards from the stockade. A picked column advanced from the crowd, waded the ditches and approached the stockade... at a word of command, scores of native policemen rushed upon the advancing marchers and rained blows on the advancing marchers's heads with scores of native policemen's steel-shot lathis [long bamboo sticks]. Not one of the advancing marchers even raised an arm to fend off blows. the advancing marchers went down like ninepins. From where A horrified American journalist, Webb Miller stood A horrified American journalist, Webb Miller heard the sickening whack of the clubs on unprotected skulls... Those struck down fell sprawling, unconscious or writhing with fractured skulls or broken shoulders. This went on for hours until some 300 or more protesters had been beaten, many seriously injured and two killed. At no time did some 300 or more protesters offer any resistance.This campaign was one of [0]'s most successful at upsetting British hold on India; Britain responded by imprisoning over 60,000\u00a0people. Congress estimates, however, put the figure at 90,000. Among over 60,000\u00a0people was one of [0]'s lieutenants, Jawaharlal Nehru.According to Sarma, [0] recruited women to participate in the salt tax campaigns and the boycott of foreign products, which gave many women a new self-confidence and dignity in the mainstream of Indian public life. However, other scholars such as Marilyn French state that [0] barred women from joining his civil disobedience movement because [0] feared [0] would be accused of using women as a political shield. When women insisted on joining his civil disobedience movement and participating in public demonstrations, [0] asked the volunteers to get permissions of the volunteers's guardians and only those women who can arrange child-care should join [0]. Regardless of [0]'s apprehensions and views, Indian women joined The march by the thousands to defy the British salt taxes and monopoly on salt mining. After [0]'s arrest, Indian women marched and picketed shops on Indian women's own, accepting violence and verbal abuse from British authorities for the cause in the manner [0] inspired.", "Gandhi as folk hero": "Mahatma Gandhi is our person to focus on. Indian Congress in the 1920s appealed to Andhra Pradesh peasants by creating Telugu language plays that combined Indian mythology and legends, linked [0] to Gandhi's ideas, and portrayed Mahatma Gandhi as a messiah, a reincarnation of ancient and medieval Indian nationalist leaders and saints. Telugu language plays that combined Indian mythology and legends built support among peasants steeped in traditional Hindu culture, according to Murali, and this effort made Mahatma Gandhi a folk hero in Telugu speaking villages, a sacred messiah-like figure.According to Dennis Dalton, it was Gandhi's ideas that were responsible for Mahatma Gandhi's wide following. Mahatma Gandhi criticised Western civilisation as one driven by \"brute force and immorality\", contrasting Western civilisation with Mahatma Gandhi's categorisation of Indian civilisation as one driven by \"soul force and morality\". Mahatma Gandhi captured the imagination of the people of his heritage with his ideas about winning \"hate with love\". his ideas about winning \"hate with love\" are evidenced in Mahatma Gandhi's pamphlets from the 1890s, in South Africa, where too Mahatma Gandhi was popular among the Indian indentured workers. After Mahatma Gandhi returned to India, people flocked to Mahatma Gandhi because Mahatma Gandhi reflected people's values.Mahatma Gandhi also campaigned hard going from one rural corner of the Indian subcontinent to another. Mahatma Gandhi used terminology and phrases such as Rama-rajya from Ramayana, Prahlada as a paradigmatic icon, and such cultural symbols as another facet of swaraj and satyagraha. During Mahatma Gandhi's lifetime, his ideas about winning \"hate with love\" sounded strange outside India, but his ideas about winning \"hate with love\" readily and deeply resonated with the culture and historic values of his heritage.", "Negotiations": "[0] is our person to focus on. The government, represented by Lord Irwin, decided to negotiate with [0]. The Gandhi\u2013Irwin Pact was signed in March 1931. The government, represented by Lord Irwin, agreed to free all political prisoners, in return for the suspension of the civil disobedience movement. According to The Gandhi\u2013Irwin Pact, [0] was invited to attend the Round Table Conference in London for discussions and as the sole representative of the Indian National Congress. the Round Table Conference in London was a disappointment to [0] and the Indian National Congress. [0] expected to discuss India's's independence, while the British side focused on the Indian princes and Indian minorities rather than on a transfer of power. Lord Irwin's successor, Lord Willingdon, took a hard line against India's, began a new campaign of controlling and subduing the Indian National Congress. [0] was again arrested, and The government, represented by Lord Irwin, tried and failed to negate [0]'s influence by completely isolating [0] from [0]'s followers.In Britain, Winston Churchill, a prominent Conservative politician who was then out of office but later became its prime minister, became a vigorous and articulate critic of [0] and opponent of [0]'s long-term plans. Winston Churchill, a prominent Conservative politician who was then out of office but later became its prime minister often ridiculed [0], saying in a widely reported 1931 speech:It is alarming and also nauseating to see [0], striding half-naked up the steps of the Vice-regal palace....to parley on equal terms with the representative of the King-Emperor. Winston Churchill, a prominent Conservative politician who was then out of office but later became its prime minister's bitterness against [0] grew in the 1930s. Winston Churchill, a prominent Conservative politician who was then out of office but later became its prime minister called [0] as the one who was \"seditious in aim\" whose evil genius and multiform menace was attacking the British empire. Winston Churchill, a prominent Conservative politician who was then out of office but later became its prime minister called [0] a dictator, a \"Hindu Mussolini\", fomenting a race war, trying to replace the Raj with Brahmin cronies, playing on the ignorance of Indian masses, all for selfish gain. Winston Churchill, a prominent Conservative politician who was then out of office but later became its prime minister attempted to isolate [0], and Winston Churchill, a prominent Conservative politician who was then out of office but later became its prime minister's was widely covered by European and American press. his criticism of Gandhi gained Winston Churchill, a prominent Conservative politician who was then out of office but later became its prime minister sympathetic support, but his criticism of Gandhi also increased support for [0] among Europeans. The developments heightened Winston Churchill, a prominent Conservative politician who was then out of office but later became its prime minister's anxiety that the \"British themselves would give up out of pacifism and misplaced conscience\".", "Round Table Conferences": "[0] is our person to focus on. During the discussions between [0] and the British government over 1931\u201332 at the Round Table Conferences, [0], sought constitutional reforms as a preparation to the end of colonial British rule, and begin the self-rule by Indians. The British side sought reforms that would keep the Indian subcontinent as a colony. The British negotiators proposed constitutional reforms on a British Dominion model that established separate electorates based on religious and social divisions. The British side questioned the Congress party and [0]'s authority to speak for all of India. The British side invited Indian religious leaders, such as Muslims and Sikhs, to press Indian religious leaders, such as Muslims and Sikhs's demands along religious lines, as well as B. R. Ambedkar as the representative leader of the untouchables. [0] vehemently opposed a constitution that enshrined rights or representations based on communal divisions, because [0] feared that a constitution that enshrined rights or representations based on communal divisions would not bring people together but divide people, perpetuate people's status, and divert the attention from the Indian subcontinent's struggle to end colonial British rule.The Second Round Table conference was the only time [0] left the Indian subcontinent between 1914 and [0]'s death in 1948. [0] declined the British government's offer of accommodation in an expensive West End hotel, preferring to stay in the East End, to live among working-class people, as [0] did in the Indian subcontinent. [0] based [0] in a small cell-bedroom at Kingsley Hall for the three-month duration of his stay and was enthusiastically received by East Enders. During the three-month duration of his stay [0] renewed [0]'s links with the British vegetarian movement.After [0] returned from The Second Round Table conference, [0] started a new satyagraha. [0] was arrested and imprisoned at the Yerwada Jail, Pune. While [0] was in prison, the British government enacted a new law that granted untouchables a separate electorate. a new law that granted untouchables a separate electorate came to be known as the Communal Award. In protest, [0] started a fast-unto-death, while [0] was held in prison. The resulting public outcry forced the British government, in consultations with B. R. Ambedkar as the representative leader of the untouchables, to replace a new law that granted untouchables a separate electorate with a compromise Poona Pact.", "Congress politics": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 1934 [0] resigned from Congress party membership. [0] did not disagree with Congress's position but felt that if [0] resigned, [0]'s popularity with Indians would cease to stifle Congress's membership, which actually varied, including communists, socialists, trade unionists, students, religious conservatives, and those with pro-business convictions, and that communists, socialists, trade unionists, students, religious conservatives, and those with pro-business convictions would get a chance to make communists, socialists, trade unionists, students, religious conservatives, and those with pro-business convictions heard. [0] also wanted to avoid being a target for Raj propaganda by leading a party that had temporarily accepted political accommodation with Raj.[0] returned to active politics again in 1936, with the Nehru presidency and the Lucknow session of Congress. Although [0] wanted a total focus on the task of winning independence and not speculation about India's future, [0] did not restrain Congress from adopting socialism as Congress's goal. [0] had a clash with Subhas Chandra Bose, who had been elected president in 1938, and who had previously expressed a lack of faith in nonviolence as a means of protest. Despite [0]'s opposition, Subhas Chandra Bose, who had been elected president in 1938, and who had previously expressed a lack of faith in nonviolence as a means of protest won a second term as Congress President, against [0]'s nominee, Bhogaraju Pattabhi Sitaramayya. [0] declared that Bhogaraju Pattabhi Sitaramayya's defeat was [0]'s defeat. Subhas Chandra Bose, who had been elected president in 1938, and who had previously expressed a lack of faith in nonviolence as a means of protest later left Congress when the All-India leaders resigned en masse in protest of Subhas Chandra Bose, who had been elected president in 1938, and who had previously expressed a lack of faith in nonviolence as a means of protest's abandonment of the principles introduced by [0].", "World War II and Quit India movement": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] opposed providing any help to the British war effort and [0] campaigned against any Indian participation in World War II. The British government responded with the arrests of [0] and many other Congress leaders and killed over 1,000 Indians who participated in this movement. A number of violent attacks were also carried out by the nationalists against The British government. While [0]'s did not enjoy the support of a number of Indian leaders, and over 2.5\u00a0million Indians volunteered and joined the British military to fight on various fronts of the Allied Forces, this movement played a role in weakening the control over the South Asian region by The British government and this movement ultimately paved the way for Indian independence.[0]'s opposition to the Indian participation in World War II was motivated by [0]'s belief that India could not be party to a war ostensibly being fought for democratic freedom while democratic freedom was denied to India. [0] also condemned Nazism and Fascism, a view which won endorsement of other Indian leaders. As World War II progressed, [0] intensified [0]'s demand for independence, calling for The British government to Quit India in a 1942 speech in Mumbai. This was [0]'s and Congress's most definitive revolt aimed at securing the British exit from India. The British government responded quickly to a 1942 speech in Mumbai, and within hours after a 1942 speech in Mumbai arrested [0] and all the members of the Congress Working Committee. His countrymen retaliated arrested by damaging or burning down hundreds of government owned railway stations, police stations, and cutting down telegraph wires.In 1942, [0], urged His countrymen to completely stop co-operating with The British government. In this effort, [0] urged that His countrymen neither kill nor injure British people, but be willing to suffer and die if violence is initiated by the British officials. [0] clarified that this movement would not be stopped because of any individual acts of violence, saying that the \"ordered anarchy\" of \"the present system of administration\" was \"worse than real anarchy.\" [0] urged Indians to karo ya maro (\"do or die\") in the cause of Indians's rights and freedoms.[0]'s lasted two years, as [0] was held in the Aga Khan Palace in Pune. During this period, [0]'s long time secretary Mahadev Desai died of a heart attack, [0]'s wife Kasturba died after 18 months' imprisonment on 22 February 1944; and [0] suffered a severe malaria attack. While in jail, [0] agreed to an interview with Stuart Gelder, a British journalist. Stuart Gelder, a British journalist then composed and released an interview summary, cabled an interview summary to the mainstream press, that announced sudden concessions [0] was willing to make, comments that shocked His countrymen, the Congress workers and [0][0]. The latter two claimed that an interview summary distorted what [0] actually said on a range of topics and falsely repudiated the Quit India movement.[0] was released before the end of the war on 6 May 1944 because of [0]'s failing health and necessary surgery; the Raj did not want [0] to die in prison and enrage India. [0] came out of detention to an altered political scene \u2013 the Muslim League for example, which a few years earlier had appeared marginal, \"now occupied the centre of the political stage\" and the topic of Jinnah's's campaign for Pakistan was a major talking point. Gandhi and Jinnah had extensive correspondence and Gandhi and Jinnah met several times over a period of two weeks in September 1944 at Jinnah's's house in Bombay, where [0] insisted on a united religiously plural and independent India which included Muslims and non-Muslims of the Indian subcontinent coexisting. Jinnah's rejected this proposal and insisted instead for partitioning the Indian subcontinent on religious lines to create a separate Muslim homeland (later Pakistan). These discussions continued through 1947.While the leaders of Congress languished in jail, the other parties supported World War II and gained organisational strength. Underground publications flailed at the ruthless suppression of Congress, but Congress had little control over events. At the end of the war, The British government gave clear indications that power would be transferred to Indian hands. At this point [0] called off the struggle, and around 100,000 political prisoners were released, including Congress's leadership.", "Partition and independence": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] opposed the partition of the Indian subcontinent along religious lines. The Indian National Congress and Gandhi called for the British to Quit India. However, the All-India Muslim League demanded \"Divide and Quit India\". [0] suggested an agreement which required The Indian National Congress and the All-India Muslim League to co-operate and attain independence under a provisional government, thereafter, the question of partition could be resolved by a plebiscite in the districts with a Muslim majority.Jinnah rejected Gandhi's proposal and called for Direct Action Day, on 16 August 1946, to press Muslims to publicly gather in cities and support Gandhi's proposalthe Indian subcontinent . Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, the the All-India Muslim League Chief Minister of Bengal \u2013 now Bangladesh and West Bengal, gave Calcutta's's police special holiday to celebrate Direct Action Day, on 16 August 1946. Direct Action Day, on 16 August 1946 triggered a mass murder of Calcutta Hindus and the torching of Calcutta Hindus's property, and holidaying police were missing to contain or stop the conflict. the British did not order the British's army to move in to contain the violence. The violence on Direct Action Day, on 16 August 1946 led to retaliatory violence against Muslims across India. Thousands of Hindus and Muslims were murdered, and tens of thousands were injured in the cycle of violence in the days that followed. [0] visited the most riot-prone areas to appeal a stop to the massacres.Archibald Wavell, the Viceroy and Governor-General of British India for three years through February 1947, had worked with The Indian National Congress and Gandhi to find a common ground, before and after accepting Indian independence in principle. Archibald Wavell, the Viceroy and Governor-General of British India for three years through February 1947, condemned [0]'s character and motives as well as [0]'s ideas. Archibald Wavell, the Viceroy and Governor-General of British India for three years through February 1947, accused [0] of harbouring the single minded idea to \"overthrow British rule and influence and to establish a Hindu raj\", and called [0] a \"malignant, malevolent, exceedingly shrewd\" politician. Archibald Wavell, the Viceroy and Governor-General of British India for three years through February 1947, feared a civil war on the Indian subcontinent, and doubted [0] would be able to stop a civil war on the Indian subcontinent.the British reluctantly agreed to grant independence to the people of the Indian subcontinent, but accepted Gandhi's proposalthe Indian subcontinent . [0] was involved in the final negotiations, but Stanley Wolpert states the \"plan to carve up India was never approved of or accepted by [0].the partition of the Indian subcontinent along religious lines was controversial and violently disputed.

Some writers present [0] as a paragon of ethical living and pacifism, while others present [0] as a more complex, contradictory and evolving character influenced by [0]'s culture and circumstances.", "Truth and Satyagraha": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] dedicated [0]'s life to discovering and pursuing truth, or Satya, and called [0]'s movement satyagraha, which means \"appeal to, insistence on, or reliance on the Truth\". The first formulation of the satyagraha as a political movement and principle occurred in 1920, which [0] tabled as \"Resolution on Non-cooperation\" in September 1920 before a session of the Indian Congress. It was the satyagraha formulation and step, states Dennis Dalton, that deeply resonated with beliefs and culture of [0]'s people, embedded [0] into the popular consciousness, transforming [0] quickly into Mahatma.[0] based the satyagraha on the Vedantic ideal of self-realisation, ahimsa (nonviolence), vegetarianism, and universal love. William Borman states that the key to the satyagraha is rooted in the Hindu Upanishadic texts. According to Indira Carr, Gandhi's ideas on ahimsa and satyagraha were founded on the philosophical foundations of Advaita Vedanta. I. Bruce Watson states that some of these ideas Gandhi's ideas on ahimsa and satyagraha are found not only in traditions within Hinduism, but also in Jainism or Buddhism, particularly those about non-violence, vegetarianism and universal love, but [0]'s synthesis was to politicise some of these ideas. [0]'s concept of satya as a civil movement, states Glyn Richards, are best understood in the context of the Hindu terminology of Dharma and \u1e5ata.[0] stated that the most important battle to fight was overcoming [0]'s own demons, fears, and insecurities. [0] summarised [0]'s beliefs first when [0] said \"God is Truth\". [0] would later change this statement to \"Truth is God\". Thus, satya (truth) in [0]'s philosophy is \"God\". [0], states Glyn Richards, described the term \"God\" not as a separate power, but as the Being (Brahman, Atman) of Advaita Vedanta, a nondual universal that pervades in all things, in each person and all life. According to Nicholas Gier, this to [0] meant the unity of God and humans, that all beings have the same one soul and therefore equality, the same one soul exists and is same as everything in the universe, ahimsa (non-violence) is the very nature of the same one soul.The essence of the satyagraha is \"soul force\" as a political means, refusing to use brute force against the oppressor, seeking to eliminate antagonisms between the oppressor and the oppressed, aiming to transform or \"purify\" the oppressor. the satyagraha is not inaction but determined passive resistance and non-co-operation where, states Arthur Herman, \"love conquers hate\". A euphemism sometimes used for the satyagraha is that the satyagraha is a \"silent force\" or a \"soul force\" (a term also used by Martin Luther King Jr. during Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"Martin Luther King Jr. Have a Dream\" speech). the satyagraha arms the individual with moral power rather than physical power. the satyagraha is also termed a \"universal force\", as the satyagraha essentially \"makes no distinction between kinsmen and strangers, young and old, man and woman, friend and foe.[0] wrote: \"There must be no impatience, no barbarity, no insolence, no undue pressure. If we want to cultivate a true spirit of democracy, we cannot afford to be intolerant. Intolerance betrays want of faith in one's cause.\" Civil disobedience and non-co-operation as practised under the satyagraha are based on the \"law of suffering\", a doctrine that the endurance of suffering is a means to an end. an end usually implies a moral upliftment or progress of an individual or society. Therefore, non-co-operation in the satyagraha is in fact a means to secure the co-operation of the opponent consistently with truth and justice.While Gandhi's idea of satyagraha as a political means attracted a widespread following among Indians, the support was not universal. For example, Muslim leaders such as Jinnah opposed Gandhi's idea of satyagraha as a political means, accused [0] to be reviving Hinduism through political activism, and began effort to counter [0] with Muslim nationalism and a demand for Muslim homeland. The untouchability leader Ambedkar, in June 1945, after The untouchability leader Ambedkar's decision to convert to Buddhism and the first Law and Justice minister of modern India, dismissed Gandhi's ideas on ahimsa and satyagraha as loved by \"blind Hindu devotees\", primitive, influenced by spurious brew of Tolstoy and Ruskin, and \"there is always some simpleton to preach Gandhi's ideas on ahimsa and satyagraha\". Winston Churchill caricatured [0] as a \"cunning huckster\" seeking selfish gain, an \"aspiring dictator\", and an \"atavistic spokesman of a pagan Hinduism\". Winston Churchill stated that the civil disobedience movement spectacle of [0] only increased \"the danger to which white people there [British India] are exposed\".", "Nonviolence": "[0] is our person to focus on. Although [0] was not the originator of the principle of nonviolence, [0] was the first to apply the principle of nonviolence in the political field on a large scale. the principle of nonviolence has a long history in Indian religious thought, and is considered the highest dharma (ethical value virtue), a precept to be observed towards all living beings (sarvbhuta), at all times (sarvada), in all respects (sarvatha), in action, words and thought. [0] explains [0]'s philosophy and ideas about ahimsa as a political means in [0]'s autobiography The Story of My Experiments with Truth.Even though [0] considered non-violence to be \"infinitely superior to violence\", [0] preferred violence to cowardice. [0] added that [0] \"would rather have India resort to arms in order to defend India's honor than that India should in a cowardly manner become or remain a helpless witness to India's own dishonor\"."}, "Literary works": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on.
