In 1884 [0] emigrated to the United States, where [0] became a naturalized citizen. [0] worked for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before [0] struck out on [0]'s own. With the help of partners to finance and market [0]'s ideas, [0] set up laboratories and companies in New York City to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. [0]'s AC induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned [0] a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which Westinghouse Electric eventually marketed.Attempting to develop inventions [0] could patent and market, [0] conducted a range of experiments with mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. [0] also built a wirelessly controlled boat, one of the first ever exhibited. [0] became well known as an inventor and demonstrated [0]'s achievements to celebrities and wealthy patrons at [0]'s lab, and was noted for [0]'s showmanship at public lectures. Throughout the 1890s, [0] pursued his ideas for wireless lighting and worldwide wireless electric power distribution in [0]'s high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York City and Colorado Springs. In 1893, [0] made pronouncements on the possibility of wireless communication with [0]'s devices. [0] tried to put his ideas for wireless lighting and worldwide wireless electric power distribution to practical use in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project, an intercontinental wireless communication and power transmitter, but ran out of funding before [0] could complete his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project, an intercontinental wireless communication and power transmitter.After his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project, an intercontinental wireless communication and power transmitter, [0] experimented with a series of inventions in the 1910s and 1920s with varying degrees of success. Having spent most of [0]'s money, [0] lived in a series of New York City hotels, leaving behind unpaid bills. [0] died in New York City in January 1943. [0]'s work fell into relative obscurity following [0]'s , until 1960, when the General Conference on Weights and Measures named the International System of Units (SI) measurement of magnetic flux density the tesla in [0]'s honor. There has been a resurgence in popular interest in [0] since the 1990s."}, "Early years": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was born an ethnic Serb in the village of Smiljan, within the Military Frontier, in the Austrian Empire (present day Croatia), on 10 July [O.S. 28 June] 1856. His father, Milutin Tesla (1819\u20131879), was a priest of the Eastern Orthodox Church.Tesla's mother, \u0110uka Mandi\u0107 (1822\u20131892), whose father was also an Eastern Orthodox Church priest, had a talent for making home craft tools and mechanical appliances and the ability to memorize Serbian epic poems. Tesla's mother, \u0110uka Mandi\u0107 (1822\u20131892), whose father was also an Eastern Orthodox Church priest had never received a formal education. [0] credited [0]'s eidetic memory and creative abilities to Tesla's mother, \u0110uka Mandi\u0107 (1822\u20131892), whose father was also an Eastern Orthodox Church priest's genetics and influence. [0]'s ancestors were from western Serbia, near Montenegro.[0] was the fourth of five children. [0] had three sisters, Milka, Angelina, and Marica, and an older brother named Dane, who was killed in a horse riding accident when [0] was aged five. In 1861, [0] attended primary school in the village of Smiljan, within the Military Frontier, in the Austrian Empire (present day Croatia) where [0] studied German, arithmetic, and religion. In 1862, the Tesla family moved to the nearby Gospi\u0107, where His father, Milutin Tesla (1819\u20131879) worked as parish priest. [0] completed primary school, followed by middle school. In 1870, [0] moved to Karlovac[better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] to attend high school at the Higher Real Gymnasium where the classes were held in German, as it was usual throughout schools within the Military Frontier, in the Austrian Empire (present day Croatia).[0] later wrote that [0] became interested in demonstrations of electricity by his physics professor. [0] noted that demonstrations of electricity by his physics professor made [0] want \"to know more of electricity\". [0] was able to perform integral calculus in [0]'s head, which prompted [0]'s teachers to believe that [0] was cheating. [0] finished a four-year term in three years, graduating in 1873.After graduating [0] returned to the village of Smiljan, within the Military Frontier, in the Austrian Empire (present day Croatia) but soon contracted cholera, was bedridden for nine months and was near death multiple times. In a moment of despair, His father, Milutin Tesla (1819\u20131879), promised to send [0] to the best engineering school if [0] recovered from the illness.[better\u00a0source\u00a0needed]The next year [0] evaded conscription into the Austro-Hungarian Army in the village of Smiljan, within the Military Frontier, in the Austrian Empire (present day Croatia) by running away southeast of Lika to Tomingaj, near Gra\u010dac. There [0] explored the mountains wearing hunter's garb. [0] said that this contact with nature made [0] stronger, both physically and mentally. [0] read many books while in Tomingaj, near Gra\u010dac and later said that Mark Twain's works had helped [0] to miraculously recover from [0]'s earlier illness.[better\u00a0source\u00a0needed]He enrolled at the Imperial-Royal Technical College in Graz in 1875 on a Military Frontier scholarship. In [0]'s autobiography [0] said [0] worked hard and earned the highest grades possible, passed nine exams[better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] (nearly twice as many as required) and received a letter of commendation from the dean of the technical faculty to His father, Milutin Tesla (1819\u20131879), which stated, \"His father, Milutin Tesla (1819\u20131879)'s is a star of first rank.\" At Graz, [0] noted [0]'s fascination with the detailed lectures on electricity presented by Professor Jakob P\u00f6schl and described how [0] made suggestions on improving the design of an electric motor Professor Jakob P\u00f6schl was demonstrating.[better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] But by [0]'s third year [0] was failing in school and never graduated, leaving Graz in December 1878. One biographer suggests [0] wasn't studying and may have been expelled for gambling and womanizing.the Tesla family did not hear from [0] after [0] left school. There was a rumor amongst his classmates that [0] had drowned in the nearby river Mur but in January one of his classmates ran into [0] in the town of Maribor and reported that encounter to the Tesla family. It turned out [0] had been working there as a draftsman for 60 florins per month. In March 1879, His father, Milutin Tesla (1819\u20131879) finally located His father, Milutin Tesla (1819\u20131879)'s and tried to convince [0] to return home and take up [0]'s education in Prague. [0] returned to Gospi\u0107 later that month when [0] was deported for not having a residence permit. His father, Milutin Tesla (1819\u20131879) died the next month, on 17 April 1879, at the age of 60 after an unspecified illness. During the rest of the year [0] taught a large class of students in [0]'s old school in Gospi\u0107.In January 1880, two of [0]'s uncles put together enough money to help [0] leave Gospi\u0107 for Prague[0] . [0] arrived too late to enroll at Charles-Ferdinand University; [0] had never studied Greek, a required subject; and [0] was illiterate in Czech, another required subject. [0] did, however, attend lectures in philosophy at Charles-Ferdinand University as an auditor but [0] did not receive grades for the courses.", "Working at Budapest Telephone Exchange": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] moved to Budapest, Hungary, in 1881 to work under Tivadar Pusk\u00e1s at a telegraph company, the Budapest Telephone Exchange. Upon arrival, [0] realized that a telegraph company, the Budapest Telephone Exchange was not functional, so [0] worked as a draftsman in the Central Telegraph Office instead. Within a few months, a telegraph company, the Budapest Telephone Exchange became functional, and [0] was allocated the chief electrician position. During [0]'s employment, [0] made many improvements to the Central Station equipment and claimed to have perfected a telephone repeater or amplifier, which was never patented nor publicly described.[better\u00a0source\u00a0needed]"}, "Working at Edison": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 1882, Tivadar Pusk\u00e1s got [0] another job in Paris with the Continental Edison Company. [0] began working in what was then a brand new industry, installing indoor incandescent lighting citywide in large scale electric power utility. the Continental Edison Company had several subdivisions and [0] worked at the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Electrique Edison, the division in the Ivry-sur-Seine suburb of Paris in charge of installing the lighting system. There [0] gained a great deal of practical experience in electrical engineering. Management took notice of [0]'s advanced knowledge in engineering and physics and soon had [0] designing and building improved versions of generating dynamos and motors. Management also sent [0] on to troubleshoot engineering problems at other the Continental Edison Company utilities being built around France and in Germany.", "Moving to the United States": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 1884, Edison manager Charles Batchelor, who had been overseeing the Paris installation, was brought back to the United States to manage the Edison Machine Works, a manufacturing division situated in New York City, and asked that [0] be brought to the United States as well. In June 1884, [0] emigrated and began working almost immediately at the Machine Works on Manhattan's's Lower East Side, an overcrowded shop with a workforce of several hundred machinists, laborers, managing staff, and 20 \"field engineers\" struggling with the task of building the large electric utility in Manhattan's. As in Paris, [0] was working on troubleshooting installations and improving generators. Historian W. Bernard Carlson notes [0] may have met Edison only a couple of times. One of those times was noted in Tesla's autobiography where, after staying up all night repairing the damaged dynamos on the ocean liner SS Oregon, [0] ran into Batchelor and Edison, who made a quip about their \"Parisian\" being out all nightBatchelor and Edison, who made a quip about their \"Parisian\" being out all night's . After [0] told Batchelor and Edison, who made a quip about their \"Parisian\" being out all night [0] had been up all night fixing the ocean liner SS Oregon, Edison commented to Batchelor that \"[0] is a damned good man\". One of the projects given to [0] was to develop an arc lamp-based street lighting system. Arc lighting was the most popular type of street lighting but Arc lighting required high voltages and was incompatible with the Edison low-voltage incandescent system, causing Edison to lose contracts in some cities. [0]'s designs were never put into production, possibly because of technical improvements in incandescent street lighting or because of an installation deal that Edison made with an arc lighting company.[0] had been working at the Edison Machine Works, a manufacturing division situated in New York City for a total of six months when [0] quit. What event precipitated [0]'s is unclear. quit may have been over a bonus [0] did not receive, either for redesigning generators or for the arc lighting system that was shelved. [0] had previous run-ins with Edison over unpaid bonuses [0] believed [0] had earned. In Tesla's autobiography, [0] stated the manager of the Edison Machine Works, a manufacturing division situated in New York City offered a $50,000 bonus to design \"twenty-four different types of standard machines\" \"but a $50,000 bonus to design \"twenty-four different types of standard machines turned out to be a practical joke\". Later versions of this story have Edison offering and then reneging on the deal, quipping \"[0], [0] don't understand Edison's American humor\". The size of the bonus in either story has been noted as odd since the Edison Machine Works, a manufacturing division situated in New York City manager Batchelor was stingy with pay and Edison did not have that amount of cash (equal to $1,628,519 today) on hand. [0]'s diary contains just one comment on what happened at the end of [0]'s employment, a note [0] scrawled across the two pages covering 7 December 1884, to 4 January 1885, saying \"Good by to the Edison Machine Works, a manufacturing division situated in New York City\"."}, "Tesla Electric Light & Manufacturing": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. Soon after leaving the Edison company, [0] was working on patenting an arc lighting system, possibly the same one he had developed at Edison. In March 1885, [0] met with patent attorney Lemuel W. Serrell, the same attorney used by Edison, to obtain help with submitting the patents. patent attorney Lemuel W. Serrell, the same attorney used by Edison introduced [0] to two businessmen, Robert Lane and Benjamin Vail, who agreed to finance an arc lighting manufacturing and utility company in Tesla's name, the Tesla Electric Light and Manufacturing Company. [0] worked for the rest of 1885 obtaining the patents that included an improved DC generator, the first patents issued to [0] in the US, and building and installing an arc lighting system, possibly the same one he had developed at Edison in Rahway, New Jersey. an arc lighting system, possibly the same one he had developed at Edison gained notice in the technical press, which commented on an arc lighting system, possibly the same one he had developed at Edison's advanced features.The investors showed little interest in [0]'s ideas for new types of alternating current motors and electrical transmission equipment. After an arc lighting system, possibly the same one he had developed at Edison was up and running in 1886, The investors decided that the manufacturing side of the business was too competitive and opted to simply run an electric utility. The investors formed a new utility company, abandoning an arc lighting manufacturing and utility company in Tesla's name, the Tesla Electric Light and Manufacturing Company and leaving [0] penniless. [0] even lost control of the patents, since [0] had assigned the patents to a new utility company in exchange for stock. [0] had to work at various electrical repair jobs and as a ditch digger for $2 per day. Later in life [0] recounted that part of 1886 as a time of hardship, writing \"[0]'s high education in various branches of science, mechanics and literature seemed to [0] like a mockery\"."}, "AC and the induction motor": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. In late 1886, [0] met Alfred S. Brown, a Western Union superintendent, and New York attorney Charles Fletcher Peck. Alfred S. Brown, a Western Union superintendent, and New York attorney Charles Fletcher Peck were experienced in setting up companies and promoting inventions and patents for financial gain. Based on [0]'s new ideas for electrical equipment, including a thermo-magnetic motor idea, Alfred S. Brown, a Western Union superintendent, and New York attorney Charles Fletcher Peck agreed to back [0] financially and handle [0]'s patents. Together Alfred S. Brown, a Western Union superintendent, and New York attorney Charles Fletcher Peck formed the Tesla Electric Company in April 1887, with an agreement that profits from generated patents would go 1\u20443 to [0], 1\u20443 to Alfred S. Brown, a Western Union superintendent, and New York attorney Charles Fletcher Peck, and 1\u20443 to fund development. Alfred S. Brown, a Western Union superintendent, and New York attorney Charles Fletcher Peck set up a laboratory for [0] at 89 Liberty Street in Manhattan, where [0] worked on improving and developing new types of electric motors, generators, and other devices.In 1887, [0] developed an induction motor that ran on alternating current (AC), a power system format that was rapidly expanding in Europe and the United States because of alternating current (AC), a power system format that was rapidly expanding in Europe and the United States's advantages in long-distance, high-voltage transmission. The motor used polyphase current, which generated a rotating magnetic field to turn The motor (a principle that [0] claimed to have conceived in 1882). The motor was a simple self-starting design that did not need a commutator, thus avoiding sparking and the high maintenance of constantly servicing and replacing mechanical brushes.Along with getting The motor patented, Alfred S. Brown, a Western Union superintendent, and New York attorney Charles Fletcher Peck arranged to get The motor publicized, starting with independent testing to verify The motor was a functional improvement, followed by press releases sent to technical publications for articles to run concurrently with the issue of patented. Physicist William Arnold Anthony (who tested The motor) and Electrical World magazine editor Thomas Commerford Martin arranged for [0] to demonstrate The motor on 16 May 1888 at the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. Engineers working for the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company reported to George Westinghouse that [0] had a viable AC motor and related power system\u2014something the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company needed for the alternating current system George Westinghouse was already marketing. the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company looked into getting a patent on a similar commutator-less, rotating magnetic field-based induction motor developed in 1885 and presented in a paper in March 1888 by Italian physicist Galileo Ferraris, but decided that [0]'s patent would probably control the market.In July 1888, Alfred S. Brown, a Western Union superintendent, and New York attorney Charles Fletcher Peck negotiated a licensing deal with George Westinghouse for [0]'s polyphase induction motor and transformer designs for $60,000 in cash and stock and a royalty of $2.50 per AC horsepower produced by each motor. the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company also hired [0] for one year for the large fee of $2,000 ($65,100 in today's dollars) per month to be a consultant at the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company's Pittsburgh labs.During one year, [0] worked in Pittsburgh, helping to create an alternating current system to power Pittsburgh's streetcars. [0] found one year a frustrating period because of conflicts with the other Westinghouse engineers the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company over how best to implement AC power. Between the other Westinghouse engineers, the other Westinghouse engineers settled on a 60-cycle AC system that Tesla proposed (to match the working frequency of Tesla's motor), but the other Westinghouse engineers soon found that a 60-cycle AC system that Tesla proposed (to match the working frequency of Tesla's motor) would not work for streetcars, since The motor could run only at a constant speed. the other Westinghouse engineers ended up using a DC traction motor instead.", "Market turmoil": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0]'s demonstration of his induction motor and Westinghouse's's subsequent licensing of the patent, both in 1888, came at the time of extreme competition between electric companies. The three big firms, Westinghouse, Edison, and Thomson-Houston Electric Company, were trying to grow in a capital-intensive business while financially undercutting The three big firms, Westinghouse, Edison, and Thomson-Houston Electric Company,. There was even a \"war of currents\" propaganda campaign going on, with Edison claiming Edison's direct current system was better and safer than the Westinghouse's alternating current system and Thomson-Houston Electric Company sometimes siding with Edison. Competing in this market meant Westinghouse's would not have the cash or engineering resources to develop his induction motor and the related polyphase system right away.Two years after signing the Tesla contract, Westinghouse's was in trouble. The near collapse of Barings Bank in London triggered the financial panic of 1890, causing investors to call in investors's loans to Westinghouse's. The sudden cash shortage forced Westinghouse's to refinance Westinghouse's's debts. The new lenders demanded that Westinghouse's cut back on what looked like excessive spending on acquisition of other companies, research, and patents, including the per motor royalty in the Tesla contract. At that point, his induction motor had been unsuccessful and was stuck in development. Westinghouse's was paying a $15,000-a-year guaranteed royalty even though operating examples of his induction motor were rare and polyphase power systems needed to run his induction motor was even rarer. In early 1891, Westinghouse's explained Westinghouse's's financial difficulties to [0] in stark terms, saying that, if Westinghouse's did not meet the demands of The new lenders, Westinghouse's would no longer be in control of Westinghouse's and [0] would have to \"deal with the bankers\" to try to collect future royalties. The advantages of having Westinghouse's continue to champion his induction motor probably seemed obvious to [0] and [0] agreed to release Westinghouse's from the royalty payment clause in the Tesla contract. Six years later Westinghouse's purchased [0]'s patent for a lump sum payment of $216,000 as part of a patent-sharing agreement signed with General Electric (a company created from the 1892 merger of Edison and Thomson-Houston Electric Company)."}, "New York laboratories": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. The money [0] made from licensing [0]'s AC patents made [0] independently wealthy and gave [0] the time and funds to pursue [0]'s own interests. In 1889, [0] moved out of the Liberty Street shop Peck and Brown had rented and for the next dozen years worked out of a series of workshop/laboratory spaces in Manhattan. a series of workshop/laboratory spaces in Manhattan included a lab at 175 Grand Street (1889\u20131892), the fourth floor of 33\u201335 South Fifth Avenue (1892\u20131895), and sixth and seventh floors of 46 & 48 East Houston Street (1895\u20131902). [0] and [0]'s hired staff conducted some of [0]'s most significant work in a series of workshop/laboratory spaces in Manhattan.", "Tesla coil": "[0] is our person to focus on. In the summer of 1889, [0] traveled to the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris and learned of Heinrich Hertz's 1886\u20131888 experiments that proved the existence of electromagnetic radiation, including radio waves. [0] found proved \"refreshing\" and decided to explore proved more fully.[citation needed] In repeating and then expanding on these experiments [0] tried powering a Ruhmkorff coil with a high speed alternator [0] had been developing as part of an improved arc lighting system but found that the high-frequency current overheated the iron core and melted the insulation between the primary and secondary windings in the coil. To fix this problem [0] came up with his \"oscillating transformer\", with an air gap instead of insulating material between the primary and secondary windings and an iron core that could be moved to different positions in or out of a Ruhmkorff coil. Later called the Tesla coil, his \"oscillating transformer\", with an air gap instead of insulating material between the primary and secondary windings would be used to produce high-voltage, low-current, high frequency alternating-current electricity. [0] would use his \"oscillating transformer\", with an air gap instead of insulating material between the primary and secondary windings in [0]'s later wireless power work.", "Citizenship": "[0] is our person to focus on. On 30 July 1891, aged 35, [0] became a naturalized citizen of the United States. In 1891, [0] patented [0]'s Tesla coil.", "Wireless lighting": "[0] is our person to focus on. After 1890, [0] experimented with transmitting power by inductive and capacitive coupling using high AC voltages generated with [0]'s Tesla coil. [0] attempted to develop a wireless lighting system based on near-field inductive and capacitive coupling and conducted a series of public demonstrations where [0] lit Geissler tubes and even incandescent light bulbs from across a stage. [0] spent most of the decade working on variations of this new form of lighting with the help of various investors but none of variations of this new form of lighting succeeded in making a commercial product out of [0]'s findings.In 1893 at St. Louis, Missouri, the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and the National Electric Light Association, [0] told onlookers that [0] was sure a system like [0] could eventually conduct \"intelligible signals or perhaps even power to any distance without the use of wires\" by conducting intelligible signals or perhaps even power through the Earth.[0] served as a vice-president of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers from 1892 to 1894, the forerunner of the modern-day IEEE (along with the Institute of Radio Engineers).", "Polyphase system and the Columbian Exposition": "[0] is our person to focus on. By the beginning of 1893, Westinghouse engineer Charles F. Scott and then Benjamin G. Lamme had made progress on an efficient version of Tesla's induction motor. Benjamin G. Lamme found a way to make the polyphase system it would need compatible with older single-phase AC and DC systems by developing a rotary converter. Westinghouse now had a way to provide electricity to all potential customers and started branding the polyphase system it would need as the \"[0] Polyphase System\". Westinghouse believed that [0]'s patents gave Westinghouse patent priority over other polyphase AC systems.Westinghouse asked [0] to participate in the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago where the company had a large space in the \"Electricity Building\" devoted to electrical exhibits. Westinghouse won the bid to light the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago where the company had a large space in the \"Electricity Building\" devoted to electrical exhibits with alternating current and won was a key event in the history of AC power, as Westinghouse demonstrated to the American public the safety, reliability, and efficiency of an alternating current system that was polyphase and could also supply the other AC and DC exhibits at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago where the company had a large space in the \"Electricity Building\" devoted to electrical exhibits.A special exhibit space was set up to display various forms and models of Tesla's induction motor. The rotating magnetic field that drove various forms and models of Tesla's induction motor was explained through a series of demonstrations including an Egg of Columbus that used the two-phase coil found in an induction motor to spin a copper egg making a copper egg stand on end.[0] visited the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago where the company had a large space in the \"Electricity Building\" devoted to electrical exhibits for a week during the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago where the company had a large space in the \"Electricity Building\" devoted to electrical exhibits's six-month run to attend the International Electrical Congress and put on a series of demonstrations at the Westinghouse exhibit. A specially darkened room had been set up where [0] showed [0]'s wireless lighting system, using a demonstration [0] had previously performed throughout America and Europe; these included using high-voltage, high-frequency alternating current to light wireless gas-discharge lamps.An observer noted:Within A specially darkened room were suspended two hard-rubber plates covered with tin foil. two hard-rubber plates covered with tin foil were about fifteen feet apart and served as terminals of the wires leading from the transformers. When the current was turned on, the lamps or tubes, which had no wires connected to wireless gas-discharge lamps, but lay on a table between two hard-rubber plates covered with tin foil, or which might be held in the hand in almost any part of A specially darkened room, were made luminous. These were the same experiments and the same apparatus shown by [0] in London about two years previous, \"where they produced so much wonder and astonishment\". ", "Steam-powered oscillating generator": "[0] is our person to focus on. During [0]'s presentation at the International Electrical Congress in the Columbian Exposition Agriculture Hall, [0] introduced his steam powered reciprocating electricity generator that he patented that year, something he thought was a better way to generate alternating current. Steam was forced into the oscillator and rushed out through a series of ports, pushing a piston up and down that was attached to an armature. an armature vibrated up and down at high speed, producing an alternating magnetic field. an alternating magnetic field induced alternating electric current in the wire coils located adjacent. his steam powered reciprocating electricity generator that he patented that year, something he thought was a better way to generate alternating current did away with the complicated parts of a steam engine/generator, but never caught on as a feasible engineering solution to generate electricity.", "Consulting on Niagara": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 1893, Edward Dean Adams, who headed the Niagara Falls Cataract Construction Company, sought [0]'s opinion on what system would be best to transmit power generated at the falls. Over several years, there had been a series of proposals and open competitions on how best to do transmit. Among proposals were two-phase and three-phase AC, high-voltage DC, and compressed air. Edward Dean Adams, who headed the Niagara Falls Cataract Construction Company, asked [0] for information about the current state of all the competing systems. [0] advised Edward Dean Adams, who headed the Niagara Falls Cataract Construction Company, that a two-phased system would be the most reliable and that there was a Westinghouse system to light incandescent bulbs using two-phase alternating current. the Niagara Falls Cataract Construction Company awarded a contract to Westinghouse for building a two-phase AC generating system at the falls, based on [0]'s advice and Westinghouse's demonstration at the Columbian Exposition. At the same time, a further contract was awarded to General Electric to build the AC distribution system.", "The Nikola Tesla Company": "Nikola Tesla is our person to focus on. In 1895, [0], impressed with what [0] saw when [0] toured Nikola Tesla's lab, agreed to help found the Nikola Tesla Company, set up to fund, develop, and market a variety of previous Tesla patents and inventions as well as new ones. Alfred Brown signed on, bringing along patents developed under Peck and Brown. The board was filled out with William Birch Rankine and Charles F. Coaney. the Nikola Tesla Company, set up to fund, develop, and market a variety of previous Tesla patents and inventions as well as new ones found few investors since the mid-1890s were a tough time financially, and the wireless lighting and oscillators patents the Nikola Tesla Company, set up to fund, develop, and market a variety of previous Tesla patents and inventions as well as new ones was set up to market never panned out. the Nikola Tesla Company, set up to fund, develop, and market a variety of previous Tesla patents and inventions as well as new ones handled Nikola Tesla's patents for decades to come.", "Lab fire": "[0] is our person to focus on. In the early morning hours of 13 March 1895, the South Fifth Avenue building that housed Tesla's lab caught fire. fire started in the basement of the South Fifth Avenue building that housed Tesla's lab and was so intense [0]'s 4th-floor lab burned and collapsed into the second floor. fire not only set back [0]'s ongoing projects, but fire also destroyed a collection of early notes and research material, models, and demonstration pieces, including many that had been exhibited at the 1893 Worlds Colombian Exposition. [0] told The New York Times \"[0] am in too much grief to talk. What can [0] say?\".  After fire [0] moved to 46 & 48 East Houston Street and rebuilt Tesla's lab on the 6th and 7th floors.", "X-ray experimentation": "[0] is our person to focus on. Starting in 1894, [0] began investigating what [0] referred to as radiant energy of \"invisible\" kinds after [0] had noticed damaged film in [0]'s laboratory in previous experiments (later identified as \"Roentgen rays\" or \"X-rays\"). [0]'s early experiments were with Crookes tubes, a cold cathode electrical discharge tube. [0] may have inadvertently captured an X-ray image\u2014predating, by a few weeks, Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen's's December 1895 announcement of the discovery of X-rays\u2014when [0] tried to photograph Mark Twain illuminated by a Geissler tube, an earlier type of gas discharge tube. The only thing captured in an X-ray image was the metal locking screw on the camera lens.In March 1896, after hearing of Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen's's discovery of X-ray and X-ray imaging (radiography), [0] proceeded to do [0]'s own experiments in X-ray imaging, developing a high-energy single-terminal vacuum tube of his own design that had no target electrode and that worked from the output of the Tesla coil (the modern term for the phenomenon produced by a high-energy single-terminal vacuum tube of his own design that had no target electrode and that worked from the output of the Tesla coil is bremsstrahlung or braking radiation). In [0]'s research, [0] devised several experimental setups to produce X-rays. [0] held that, with [0]'s circuits, the \"instrument will\u00a0... enable one to generate Roentgen rays of much greater power than obtainable with ordinary apparatus\".[0] noted the hazards of working with [0]'s circuit and single-node X-ray-producing devices. In [0]'s many notes on the early investigation of X-ray imaging, [0] attributed the skin damage to various causes. [0] believed early on that damage to the skin was not caused by Roentgen rays, but by the ozone generated in contact with the skin, and to a lesser extent, by nitrous acid. [0] incorrectly believed that X-rays were longitudinal waves, such as those produced in waves in plasmas. longitudinal waves, such as those produced in waves in plasmas can occur in force-free magnetic fields.On 11 July 1934, the New York Herald Tribune published an article on [0], in which [0] recalled an event that occasionally took place while experimenting with his single-electrode vacuum tubes. A minute particle would break off the cathode, pass out of the tube, and physically strike [0]:[0] said [0] could feel a sharp stinging pain where A minute particle entered [0]'s body, and again at the place where A minute particle passed out. In comparing his single-electrode vacuum tubes with the bits of metal projected by [0]'s \"electric gun\", [0] said, \"The particles in the beam of force\u00a0... will travel much faster than such particles\u00a0... and The particles in the beam of force will travel in concentrations\".", "Radio remote control": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 1898, [0] demonstrated a boat that used a coherer-based radio control\u2014which [0] dubbed \"telautomaton\"\u2014to the public during an electrical exhibition at Madison Square Garden. [0] tried to sell [0]'s idea to the US military as a type of radio-controlled torpedo, but the US military showed little interest. Remote radio control remained a novelty until World War I and afterward, when a number of countries used Remote radio control in military programs. [0] took the opportunity to further demonstrate \"Teleautomatics\" in an address to a meeting of the Commercial Club in Chicago, while [0] was travelling to Colorado Springs, on 13 May 1899."}, "Wireless power": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. From the 1890s through 1906, [0] spent a great deal of [0]'s time and fortune on a series of projects trying to develop the transmission of electrical power without wires. the transmission of electrical power without wires was an expansion of his idea of using coils to transmit power that he had been demonstrating in wireless lighting. [0] saw his idea of using coils to transmit power that he had been demonstrating in wireless lighting as not only a way to transmit large amounts of power around the world but also, as [0] had pointed out in [0]'s earlier lectures, a way to transmit worldwide communications.At the time [0] was formulating [0]'s ideas, there was no feasible way to wirelessly transmit communication signals over long distances, let alone large amounts of power. [0] had studied radio waves early on, and came to the conclusion that part of the existing study on radio waves, by Hertz, was incorrect. Also, this new form of radiation was widely considered at the time to be a short-distance phenomenon that seemed to die out in less than a mile. [0] noted that, even if theories on radio waves were true, theories on radio waves were totally worthless for [0]'s intended purposes since this new form of radiation would diminish over a distance just like any other radiation and would travel in straight lines right out into space, becoming \"hopelessly lost\".By the mid-1890s, [0] was working on the idea that he might be able to conduct electricity long distance through the Earth or the atmosphere, and began working on experiments to test the idea that he might be able to conduct electricity long distance through the Earth or the atmosphere including setting up a large resonance transformer magnifying transmitter in [0]'s East Houston Street lab. Seeming to borrow from a common idea at the time that the atmosphere was conductive, [0] proposed a system composed of balloons suspending, transmitting, and receiving, electrodes in the air above 30,000 feet (9,100\u00a0m) in altitude, where [0] thought the lower pressure would allow [0] to send high voltages (millions of volts) long distances.", "Colorado Springs": "[0] is our person to focus on. To further study the conductive nature of low-pressure air, [0] set up an experimental station at high altitude in Colorado Springs during 1899.  There [0] could safely operate much larger coils than in the cramped confines of his New York lab, and an associate had made an arrangement for the El Paso Power Company to supply alternating current free of charge. To fund his experiments, [0] convinced John Jacob Astor IV to invest $100,000 ($3,517,600 in today's dollars) to become a majority shareholder in the Nikola Tesla Company. John Jacob Astor IV thought John Jacob Astor IV was primarily investing in the new wireless lighting system. Instead, [0] used $100,000 ($3,517,600 in today's dollars) to fund his experimentsColorado Springs . Upon [0]'s arrival, [0] told reporters that [0] planned to conduct wireless telegraphy experiments, transmitting signals from Pikes Peak to Paris.There, [0] conducted experiments with a large coil operating in the megavolts range, producing artificial lightning (and thunder) consisting of millions of volts and discharges of up to 135 feet (41\u00a0m) in length, and, at one point, inadvertently burned out the generator in the El Paso Power Company, causing a power outage. The observations [0] made of the electronic noise of lightning strikes led [0] to (incorrectly) conclude that [0] could use the entire globe of the Earth to conduct electrical energy.During [0]'s time at his New York lab, [0] observed unusual signals from his receiver which he speculated to be communications from another planet. [0] mentioned unusual signals from his receiver which he speculated to be communications from another planet in a letter to a reporter in December 1899 and to the Red Cross Society in December 1900. Reporters treated it as a sensational story and jumped to the conclusion [0] was hearing signals from Mars. [0] expanded on unusual signals from his receiver which he speculated to be communications from another planet in a 9 February 1901 Collier's Weekly article entitled \"Talking With Planets\", where [0] said it had not been immediately apparent to [0] that [0] was hearing \"intelligently controlled signals\" and that unusual signals from his receiver which he speculated to be communications from another planet could have come from Mars, Venus, or other planets. It has been hypothesized that [0] may have intercepted Guglielmo Marconi's's European experiments in July 1899\u2014Guglielmo Marconi's may have transmitted the letter S (dot/dot/dot) in a naval demonstration, the same three impulses that [0] hinted at hearing in Colorado Springs\u2014or signals from another experimenter in wireless transmission.[0] had an agreement with the editor of The Century Magazine to produce an article on his findings. The Century Magazine sent a photographer to Colorado Springs to photograph the work being done there. an article on his findings, appeared in the June 1900 edition of The Century Magazine. [0] explained the superiority of the wireless system [0] envisioned but an article on his findings was more of a lengthy philosophical treatise than an understandable scientific description of [0]'s work, illustrated with what were to become iconic images of [0] and Colorado Springs Colorado Springs .", "Wardenclyffe": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] made the rounds in New York trying to find investors for what [0] thought would be a viable system of wireless transmission, wining and dining investors at the Waldorf-Astoria's's Palm Garden (the hotel where [0] was living at the time), The Players Club, and Delmonico's. In March 1901, [0] obtained $150,000 ($5,276,400 in today's dollars) from J. P. Morgan in return for a 51% share of any generated wireless patents, and began planning the Wardenclyffe Tower facility to be built in Shoreham, New York, 100 miles (161\u00a0km) east of New York on the North Shore of Long Island.By July 1901, [0] had expanded [0]'s plans to build a more powerful transmitter to leap ahead of Marconi's radio-based system, which Tesla thought was a copy of his own. [0] approached J. P. Morgan to ask for more money to build the larger system, but J. P. Morgan refused to supply any further funds. In December 1901, Marconi's successfully transmitted the letter S from England to Newfoundland, defeating [0] in the race to be first to complete such a transmission. A month after Marconi's's success, [0] tried to get J. P. Morgan to back an even larger plan to transmit messages and power by controlling \"vibrations throughout the globe\". Over the next five years, [0] wrote more than 50 letters to J. P. Morgan, pleading for and demanding additional funding to complete the construction of Wardenclyffe. [0] continued an even larger plan to transmit messages and power by controlling \"vibrations throughout the globe\" for another nine months into 1902. Wardenclyffe was erected to Wardenclyffe's full height of 187 feet (57\u00a0m). In June 1902, [0] moved [0]'s lab operations from Houston Street to Wardenclyffe.Investors on Wall Street were putting Investors on Wall Street's money into Marconi's radio-based system, which Tesla thought was a copy of his own, and some in the press began turning against an even larger plan to transmit messages and power by controlling \"vibrations throughout the globe\", claiming an even larger plan to transmit messages and power by controlling \"vibrations throughout the globe\" was a hoax. an even larger plan to transmit messages and power by controlling \"vibrations throughout the globe\" came to a halt in 1905, and in 1906, the financial problems and other events may have led to what [0] biographer Marc J. Seifer suspects was a nervous breakdown on [0]'s part. [0] mortgaged the Wardenclyffe property to cover [0]'s debts at the Waldorf-Astoria's, which eventually amounted to $20,000 ($584,300 in today's dollars). [0] lost the Wardenclyffe property in foreclosure in 1915, and in 1917 Wardenclyffe was demolished by the new owner to make the Wardenclyffe property a more viable real estate asset."}, "Later years": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. After Wardenclyffe closed, [0] continued to write to Morgan; after Morgan died, [0] wrote to Morgan's son Jack, trying to get further funding for the project. In 1906, [0] opened offices at 165 Broadway in Manhattan, trying to raise further funds by developing and marketing [0]'s patents. [0] went on to have offices at the Metropolitan Life Tower from 1910 to 1914; rented for a few months at the Woolworth Building, moving out because [0] could not afford the rent; and then to office space at 8 West 40th Street from 1915 to 1925. After moving to 8 West 40th Street, [0] was effectively bankrupt. Most of [0]'s patents had run out and [0] was having trouble with the new inventions [0] was trying to develop.", "Bladeless turbine": "[0] is our person to focus on. On [0]'s 50th birthday, in 1906, [0] demonstrated a 200 horsepower (150 kilowatts) 16,000\u00a0rpm bladeless turbine. During 1910\u20131911, at the Waterside Power Station in New York, several of [0]'s bladeless turbine engines were tested at 100\u20135,000\u00a0hp. [0] worked with several companies including from 1919 to 1922 in Milwaukee, for Allis-Chalmers. [0] spent most of [0]'s time trying to perfect the Tesla turbine with Hans Dahlstrand, the head engineer at Allis-Chalmers, but engineering difficulties meant the Tesla turbine was never made into a practical device. [0] did license the idea to a precision instrument company and the Tesla turbine found use in the form of luxury car speedometers and other instruments.", "Wireless lawsuits": "Nikola Tesla is our person to focus on. When World War I broke out, [0] cut the transatlantic telegraph cable linking the US to Germany in order to control the flow of information between the two countries. [0] also tried to shut off German wireless communication to and from the US by having the US Marconi Company sue the German radio company Telefunken for patent infringement. the German radio company Telefunken brought in the physicists Jonathan Zenneck and Karl Ferdinand Braun for the German radio company Telefunken's defense, and hired Nikola Tesla as a witness for two years for $1,000 a month. The case stalled and then went moot when the US entered the war against Germany in 1917.In 1915, Nikola Tesla attempted to sue the US Marconi Company for infringement of Nikola Tesla's wireless tuning patents. the US Marconi Company's initial radio patent had been awarded in the US in 1897, but his 1900 patent submission covering improvements to radio transmission had been rejected several times, before his 1900 patent submission covering improvements to radio transmission was finally approved in 1904, on the grounds that his 1900 patent submission covering improvements to radio transmission infringed on other existing patents including two 1897 Nikola Tesla wireless power tuning patents. Nikola Tesla's 1915 case went nowhere, but in a related case, where the US Marconi Company tried to sue the US government over WWI patent infringements, a Supreme Court of the United States 1943 decision restored the prior patents of Oliver Lodge, John Stone, and Nikola Tesla. Supreme Court of the United States declared that a Supreme Court of the United States 1943 decision had no bearing on the US Marconi Company's claim as the first to achieve radio transmission, just that since the US Marconi Company's claim to certain patented improvements were questionable, the US Marconi Company could not claim infringement on certain patented improvements.", "Nobel Prize rumors": "[0] is our person to focus on. On 6 November 1915, a Reuters news agency report from London had the 1915 Nobel Prize in Physics awarded to Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla; however, on 15 November, a Reuters news agency story from Stockholm stated the 1915 Nobel Prize in Physics was being awarded to William Henry Bragg and Lawrence Bragg \"for William Henry Bragg and Lawrence Bragg's services in the analysis of crystal structure by means of X-rays\". There were unsubstantiated rumors at the time that either [0] or Thomas Edison had refused the 1915 Nobel Prize in Physics. The Nobel Foundation said, \"Any rumor that a person has not been given a Nobel Prize because a person has made known a person's intention to refuse a Nobel Prize is ridiculous\"; a recipient could decline a Nobel Prize only after a recipient is announced a winner.There have been subsequent claims by [0] biographers that Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla were the original recipients and that neither was given the 1915 Nobel Prize in Physics because of Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla's animosity toward Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla; that each sought to minimize the other's achievements and right to win the 1915 Nobel Prize in Physics; that Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla refused ever to accept the 1915 Nobel Prize in Physics if the other received the 1915 Nobel Prize in Physics first; that Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla rejected any possibility of sharing the 1915 Nobel Prize in Physics; and even that a wealthy Edison refused the 1915 Nobel Prize in Physics to keep [0] from getting the $20,000 prize money.In the years after these rumors, neither [0] nor Thomas Edison won a Nobel prize (although Thomas Edison received one of 38 possible bids in 1915 and [0] received one of 38 possible bids in 1937).", "Other awards, patents and ideas": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] won numerous medals and awards over this time. numerous medals and awards include:[0] attempted to market several devices based on the production of ozone. several devices based on the production of ozone included [0]'s 1900 Tesla Ozone Company selling an 1896 patented device based on his Tesla coil, used to bubble ozone through different types of oils to make a therapeutic gel. [0] also tried to develop a variation of an 1896 patented device based on his Tesla coil, used to bubble ozone through different types of oils to make a therapeutic gel a few years later as a room sanitizer for hospitals.[0] theorized that the application of electricity to the brain enhanced intelligence. In 1912, [0] crafted \"a plan to make dull students bright by saturating them unconsciously with electricity,\" wiring the walls of a schoolroom and, \"saturating [a schoolroom] with infinitesimal electric waves vibrating at high frequency. a schoolroom will thus, [0] claims, be converted into a health-giving and stimulating electromagnetic field or 'bath.'\" a plan to make dull students bright by saturating them unconsciously with electricity was, at least provisionally, approved by then superintendent of New York City schools, William H. Maxwell.Before World War I, [0] sought overseas investors. After World War I started, [0] lost the funding [0] was receiving from [0]'s patents in European countries.In the August 1917 edition of the magazine Electrical Experimenter, [0] postulated that electricity could be used to locate submarines via using the reflection of an \"electric ray\" of \"tremendous frequency,\" with the signal being viewed on a fluorescent screen (a system that has been noted to have a superficial resemblance to modern radar). [0] was incorrect in [0]'s assumption that high-frequency radio waves would penetrate water. \u00c9mile Girardeau, who helped develop France's first radar system in the 1930s, noted in 1953 that [0]'s general speculation that a very strong high-frequency signal would be needed was correct. \u00c9mile Girardeau, who helped develop France's first radar system in the 1930s, said, \"([0]) was prophesying or dreaming, since [0] had at [0]'s disposal no means of carrying them out, but one must add that if [0] was dreaming, at least [0] was dreaming correctly\".In 1928, [0] received patent, U.S. Patent 1,655,114, for a biplane design capable of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL), which \"gradually tilted through manipulation of the elevator devices\" in flight until it was flying like a conventional plane. This impractical design was something [0] thought would sell for less than $1,000.Tesla had a further office at 350 Madison Ave but by 1928 [0] no longer had a laboratory or funding.", "Living circumstances": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] lived at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City from 1900 and ran up a large bill. [0] moved to the St. Regis Hotel in 1922 and followed a pattern from then on of moving to a different hotel every few years and leaving unpaid bills behind.[0] walked to the park every day to feed the pigeons. [0] began feeding the pigeons at the window of [0]'s hotel room and nursed injured birds back to health. [0] said that [0] had been visited by a certain injured white pigeon daily. [0] spent over $2,000 (equivalent to $34,970 in 2022) to care for a certain injured white pigeon, including a device [0] built to support a certain injured white pigeon comfortably while a certain injured white pigeon's broken wing and leg healed. [0] stated:[0] have been feeding pigeons, thousands of pigeons for years. But there was a certain injured white pigeona certain injured white pigeon's ; a certain injured white pigeon was different. a certain injured white pigeon was a female. [0] had only to wish and call a certain injured white pigeon and a certain injured white pigeon would come flying to [0]. [0] loved a certain injured white pigeon as a man loves a woman, and a certain injured white pigeon loved [0]. As long as [0] had a certain injured white pigeon, there was a purpose to [0]'s life. [0]'s unpaid bills, as well as complaints about the mess made by pigeons, led to [0]'s eviction from the St. Regis Hotel in 1923. [0] was also forced to leave the Hotel Pennsylvania in 1930 and the Hotel Governor Clinton in 1934. At one point [0] also took rooms at the Hotel Marguery.[citation [0] moved to the Hotel New Yorker in 1934. At this time Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company began paying [0] $125 (equivalent to $2,730 in 2022) per month in addition to paying [0]'s rent. Accounts of how paying came about vary. Several sources claim that Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company was concerned, or possibly warned, about potential bad publicity arising from the impoverished conditions in which Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company's was living. paying has been described as being couched as a \"consulting fee\" to get around [0]'s aversion to accepting charity. [0] biographer Marc Seifer described paying Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company as a type of \"unspecified settlement\". In any case, Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company provided the funds for [0] for the rest of [0]'s life.[citation needed]", "Birthday press conferences": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 1931, a young journalist whom [0] befriended, Kenneth M. Swezey, organized a celebration for the inventor's 75th birthday. [0] received congratulations from figures in science and engineering such as Albert Einstein, and [0] was also featured on the cover of Time magazine. The cover caption \"All the world's [0]'s power house\" noted [0]'s contribution to electrical power generation. a celebration for the inventor's 75th birthday went so well that [0] made a celebration for the inventor's 75th birthday an annual event, an occasion where [0] would put out a large spread of food and drink\u2014featuring dishes of [0]'s own creation. [0] invited the press in order to see [0]'s inventions and hear stories about [0]'s past exploits, views on current events, and sometimes baffling claims.At the 1932 party, [0] claimed [0] had invented a motor that would run on cosmic rays.In 1933, at age 77, [0] told reporters at the event that, after 35 years of work, [0] was on the verge of producing proof of a new form of energy. [0] claimed a new form of energy was a theory of energy that was \"violently opposed\" to Einsteinian physics and could be tapped with an apparatus that would be cheap to run and last 500 years. [0] also told reporters [0] was working on a way to transmit individualized private radio wavelengths, working on breakthroughs in metallurgy, and developing a way to photograph the retina to record thought.At the 1934 occasion, [0] told reporters [0] had designed a superweapon he claimed would end all war. [0] called a superweapon he claimed would end all war \"teleforce\", but was usually referred to as [0]'s death ray. In 1940, the New York Times gave a range for a superweapon he claimed would end all war of 250 miles (400\u00a0km), with an expected development cost of US$2\u00a0million (equivalent to $41.78\u00a0million in 2022). [0] described a superweapon he claimed would end all war as a defensive weapon that would be put up along the border of a country and be used against attacking ground-based infantry or aircraft. [0] never revealed detailed plans of how the weapon worked a superweapon he claimed would end all war during [0]'s lifetime but, in 1984, detailed plans of how the weapon worked surfaced at the Nikola Tesla Museum archive in Belgrade. The treatise, The New Art of Projecting Concentrated Non-dispersive Energy through the Natural Media, described an open-ended vacuum tube with a gas jet seal that allows particles to exit, a method of charging slugs of tungsten or mercury to millions of volts, and directing slugs of tungsten or mercury in streams (through electrostatic repulsion). [0] tried to attract interest of the US War Department, United Kingdom, Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia in a superweapon he claimed would end all war.In 1935, at [0]'s 79th birthday party, [0] covered many topics. [0] claimed to have discovered the cosmic ray in 1896 and invented a way to produce direct current by induction, and made many claims about his mechanical oscillator. Describing his mechanical oscillator [0] told reporters that a version of his mechanical oscillator had caused an earthquake in [0]'s 46 East Houston Street lab and neighboring streets in Lower Manhattan in 1898. [0] went on to tell reporters his mechanical oscillator could destroy the Empire State Building with 5 pounds (2.3\u00a0kg) of air pressure. [0] also explained a new technique he developed using his oscillators he called \"telegeodynamics\", using a new technique he developed using his oscillators he called \"telegeodynamics\" to transmit vibrations into the ground that [0] claimed would work over any distance to be used for communication or locating underground mineral deposits.In 1937, at [0]'s Grand Ballroom of Hotel New Yorker event, [0] received the Order of the White Lion from the Czechoslovak ambassador and a medal from the Yugoslav ambassador. On questions concerning a superweapon he claimed would end all war, [0] stated: \"But a superweapon he claimed would end all war is not an experiment\u00a0... [0] have built, demonstrated and used a superweapon he claimed would end all war. Only a little time will pass before [0] can give a superweapon he claimed would end all war to the world.\""}, "Death": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. In the fall of 1937 at the age of 81, after midnight one night, [0] left the Hotel New Yorker to make [0]'s regular commute to the cathedral and library to feed the pigeons. While crossing a street a couple of blocks from the Hotel New Yorker, [0] was struck by a moving taxicab and was thrown to the ground. [0]'s back was severely wrenched and three of [0]'s ribs were broken in struck. The full extent of [0]'s injuries was never known; [0] refused to consult a doctor, an almost lifelong custom, and never fully recovered.On 7 January 1943, at the age of 86, [0] died alone in Room 3327 of the Hotel New Yorker. His body was found by maid Alice Monaghan when maid Alice Monaghan entered Room 3327 of the Hotel New Yorker, ignoring the \"do not disturb\" sign that [0] had placed on [0]'s door two days earlier. Assistant medical examiner H.W. Wembley examined His body and ruled that the cause of death had been coronary thrombosis (a type of heart attack).Two days later the Federal Bureau of Investigation ordered the Alien Property Custodian to seize Tesla's belongings. John G. Trump, a professor at M.I.T. and a well-known electrical engineer serving as a technical aide to the National Defense Research Committee, was called in to analyze Tesla's belongings. After a three-day investigation, John G. Trump, a professor at M.I.T. and a well-known electrical engineer serving as a technical aide to the National Defense Research Committee,'s report concluded that there was nothing which would constitute a hazard in unfriendly hands, stating:[0]'s [Tesla's] thoughts and efforts during at least the past 15 years were primarily of a speculative, philosophical, and somewhat promotional character often concerned with the production and wireless transmission of power; but did not include new, sound, workable principles or methods for realizing such results. In a box purported to contain a part of [0]'s \"death ray\", John G. Trump, a professor at M.I.T. and a well-known electrical engineer serving as a technical aide to the National Defense Research Committee, found a 45-year-old multidecade resistance box.On 10 January 1943, New York City mayor Fiorello La Guardia read a eulogy written by Slovene-American author Louis Adamic live over the WNYC radio while violin pieces \"Ave Maria\" and \"Tamo daleko\" were played in the background. On 12 January, two thousand people attended a state funeral for Tesla at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in Manhattan. After a state funeral for Tesla at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in Manhattan, His body was taken to the Ferncliff Cemetery in Ardsley, New York, where His body was later cremated. The following day, a second service was conducted by prominent priests in the Trinity Chapel (today's Serbian Orthodox Cathedral of Saint Sava) in New York.", "Estate": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 1952, following pressure from Tesla's nephew, Sava Kosanovi\u0107, [0]'s entire estate was shipped to Belgrade in 80 trunks marked N.T. In 1957, Tesla's nephew, Sava Kosanovi\u0107's secretary Charlotte Muzar transported Tesla's ashes from the United States to Belgrade. Tesla's ashes are displayed in a gold-plated sphere on a marble pedestal in the [0] Museum."}, "Patents": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] obtained around 300 patents worldwide for [0]'s inventions. Some of Tesla's patents are not accounted for, and various sources have discovered some that have lain hidden in patent archives. There are a minimum of 278 known patents issued to [0] in 26 countries. Many of Tesla's patents were in the United States, Britain, and Canada, but many other patents were approved in countries around the globe. Many inventions developed by [0] were not put into patent protection."}, "Personal life and character": {"Appearance": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was 6\u00a0feet 2\u00a0inches (1.88\u00a0m) tall and weighed 142 pounds (64\u00a0kg), with almost no weight variance from 1888 to about 1926. [0]'s appearance was described by newspaper editor Arthur Brisbane as \"almost the tallest, almost the thinnest and certainly the most serious man who goes to Delmonico's regularly\". [0] was an elegant, stylish figure in New York City, meticulous in [0]'s grooming, clothing, and regimented in [0]'s daily activities, an appearance [0] maintained so as to further [0]'s business relationships. [0] was also described as having light eyes, \"very big hands\", and \"remarkably big\" thumbs.", "Eidetic memory": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] read many works, memorizing complete books, and supposedly possessed a photographic memory. [0] was a polyglot, speaking eight languages: Serbo-Croatian, Czech, English, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, and Latin. [0] related in his autobiography that [0] experienced detailed moments of inspiration. During [0]'s early life, [0] was repeatedly stricken with illness. Blinding flashes of light would appear before [0]'s eyes, often accompanied by visions. Often, visions were linked to a word or idea [0] might have come across; at other times visions provided the solution to a particular problem [0] had encountered. Just by hearing the name of an item, [0] could envision an item in realistic detail. [0] visualized an invention in [0]'s mind with extreme precision, including all dimensions, before moving to the construction stage, a technique sometimes known as picture thinking. [0] typically did not make drawings by hand but worked from memory. Beginning in [0]'s childhood, [0] had frequent flashbacks to events that had happened previously in [0]'s life. [0] noted in his autobiography that this affliction had developed [0]'s powers of observation and enabled [0] to discover a \"truth of great importance\", namely that every thought [0] conceived was suggested by an external impression. [0] further wrote that \"deficient observation was merely a form of ignorance and responsible for the many morbid notions and foolish ideas prevailing.\" ", "Relationships": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was a lifelong bachelor, who had once explained that [0]'s chastity was very helpful to [0]'s scientific abilities. [0] once said in earlier years that [0] felt [0] could never be worthy enough for a woman, considering women superior in every way. [0]'s opinion had started to sway in later years when [0] felt that women were trying to outdo men and make women more dominant. This \"new woman\" was met with much indignation from [0]. In an interview with the Galveston Daily News on 10 August 1924 [0] stated, \"In place of the soft-voiced, a gentlewoman of [0]'s reverent worship, has come the woman who thinks that her's chief success in life lies in making her as much as possible like man\u2014in dress, voice and actions, in sports and achievements of every kind\u00a0... The tendency of women to push aside man, supplanting the old spirit of cooperation with man in all the affairs of life, is very disappointing to [0].\"[citation needed] Although [0] told a reporter in later years that [0] sometimes felt that by not marrying, [0] had made too great a sacrifice to his work, [0] chose to never pursue or engage in any known relationships, instead finding all the stimulation [0] needed in his work.[0] was asocial and prone to seclude [0] with his work. However, when [0] did engage in social life, many people spoke very positively and admiringly of [0]. Robert Underwood Johnson described [0] as attaining a \"distinguished sweetness, sincerity, modesty, refinement, generosity, and force\". [0]'s secretary, Dorothy Skerrit, wrote: \"[0]'s genial smile and nobility of bearing always denoted the gentlemanly characteristics that were so ingrained in [0]'s soul\". [0]'s friend, Julian Hawthorne, wrote, \"seldom did one meet a scientist or engineer who was also a poet, a philosopher, an appreciator of fine music, a linguist, and a connoisseur of food and drink\".[0] was a good friend of Francis Marion Crawford, Robert Underwood Johnson, Stanford White, Fritz Lowenstein, George Scherff, and Kenneth Swezey. In middle age, [0] became a close friend of Mark Twain; they spent a lot of time together in [0]'s lab and elsewhere. Mark Twain notably described [0]'s induction motor invention as \"the most valuable patent since the telephone\". At a party thrown by actress Sarah Bernhardt in 1896, [0] met Indian Hindu monk Swami Vivekananda. Indian Hindu monk Swami Vivekananda later wrote that [0] said [0] could demonstrate mathematically the relationship between matter and energy, something Indian Hindu monk Swami Vivekananda hoped would give a scientific foundation to Vedantic cosmology. met Indian Hindu monk Swami Vivekananda stimulated [0]'s interest in Eastern Science, which led to [0] studying Hindu and Vedic philosophy for a number of years. [0] later wrote an article titled \"Man's Greatest Achievement\" using Sanskrit terms akasha and prana to describe the relationship between matter and energy. In the late 1920s, [0] befriended George Sylvester Viereck, a poet, writer, mystic, and later, a Nazi propagandist. [0] occasionally attended dinner parties held by George Sylvester Viereck, a poet, writer, mystic, and later, a Nazi propagandist and George Sylvester Viereck, a poet, writer, mystic, and later, a Nazi propagandist's wife.[0] could be harsh at times and openly expressed disgust for overweight people, such as when [0] fired a secretary because of a secretary's weight. [0] was quick to criticize clothing; on several occasions, [0] directed a subordinate to go home and change a subordinate's dress. When Thomas Edison died, in 1931, [0] contributed the only negative opinion to The New York Times, buried in an extensive coverage of Thomas Edison's life:Thomas Edison had no hobby, cared for no sort of amusement of any kind and lived in utter disregard of the most elementary rules of hygiene\u00a0... Thomas Edison's method was inefficient in the extreme, for an immense ground had to be covered to get anything at all unless blind chance intervened and, at first, [0] was almost a sorry witness of Thomas Edison's doings, knowing that just a little theory and calculation would have saved Thomas Edison 90 percent of the labor. But Thomas Edison had a veritable contempt for book learning and mathematical knowledge, trusting Thomas Edison entirely to Thomas Edison's instinct and practical American sense. ", "Sleep habits": "Nikola Tesla is our person to focus on. [0] claimed never to sleep more than two hours per night. However, [0] did admit to \"dozing\" from time to time \"to recharge [0]'s batteries\". During [0]'s second year of study at Graz, [0] developed a passionate proficiency for billiards, chess, and card-playing, sometimes spending more than 48 hours in a stretch at a games table. On one occasion at [0]'s laboratory, [0] worked for a period of 84 hours without rest. Kenneth Swezey, a journalist whom Tesla had befriended, confirmed that [0] rarely slept. Kenneth Swezey, a journalist whom Tesla had befriended recalled one morning when [0] called Kenneth Swezey, a journalist whom Tesla had befriended at 3 a.m.: \"Kenneth Swezey, a journalist whom Tesla had befriended was sleeping in Kenneth Swezey, a journalist whom Tesla had befriended's room like one dead\u00a0... Suddenly, the telephone ring awakened Kenneth Swezey, a journalist whom Tesla had befriended\u00a0... [0] [0]spoke animatedly, with pauses, [as [0]]\u00a0... work[ed] out a problem, comparing one theory to another, commenting; and when [0] felt [0] had arrived at the solution, [0] suddenly closed the telephone.\"", "Work and dining habits": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] worked every day from 9:00\u00a0a.m. until 6:00\u00a0p.m. or later, with dinner at exactly 8:10\u00a0p.m., at Delmonico's restaurant and later the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. [0] then telephoned [0]'s dinner order to the headwaiter, who also could be the only one to serve [0]. \"The meal was required to be ready at eight o'clock\u00a0... [0] dined alone, except on the rare occasions when [0] would give a dinner to a group to meet [0]'s social obligations. [0] then resumed [0]'s work, often until 3:00\u00a0a.m.\"For exercise, [0] walked between 8 and 10 miles (13 and 16\u00a0km) per day. [0] curled [0]'s toes one hundred times for each foot every night, saying that curled stimulated [0]'s brain cells.In an interview with newspaper editor Arthur Brisbane, [0] said that [0] did not believe in telepathy, stating, \"Suppose [0] made up [0]'s mind to murder you,\" [0] said, \"In a second you would know murder. Now, isn't that wonderful? By what process does the mind get at all this?\" In an interview with newspaper editor Arthur Brisbane, [0] said that [0] believed that all fundamental laws could be reduced to one.[0] became a vegetarian in [0]'s later years, living on only milk, bread, honey, and vegetable juices.", "": ""}, "Views and beliefs": {"On experimental and theoretical physics": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] disagreed with the theory of atoms being composed of smaller subatomic particles, stating there was no such thing as an electron creating an electric charge. [0] believed that if electrons existed at all, electrons were some fourth state of matter or \"sub-atom\" that could exist only in an experimental vacuum and that electrons had nothing to do with electricity. [0] believed that atoms are immutable\u2014atoms could not change state or be split in any way. [0] was a believer in the 19th-century concept of an all-pervasive ether that transmitted electrical energy.[0] was generally antagonistic towards theories about the conversion of matter into energy. [0] was also critical of Einstein's theory of relativity, saying:[0] hold that space cannot be curved, for the simple reason that space can have no properties. It might as well be said that God has properties. God has not, but only attributes and only attributes are of our own making. Of only attributes we can only speak when dealing with matter filling the space. To say that in the presence of large bodies space becomes curved is equivalent to stating that something can act upon nothing. [0], for one, refuse to subscribe to such a view. In 1935 [0] described relativity as \"a beggar wrapped in purple whom ignorant people take for a king\" and said [0]'s own experiments had measured the speed of cosmic rays from Arcturus as fifty times the speed of light.[0] claimed to have developed [0]'s own physical principle regarding matter and energy that [0] started working on in 1892, and in 1937, at age 81, claimed in a letter to have completed a \"dynamic theory of gravity\" that \"[would] put an end to idle speculations and false conceptions, as that of curved space\". [0] stated that a \"dynamic theory of gravity\" that \"[would] put an end to idle speculations and false conceptions, as that of curved space\" was \"worked out in all details\" and that [0] hoped to soon give a \"dynamic theory of gravity\" that \"[would] put an end to idle speculations and false conceptions, as that of curved space\" to the world. Further elucidation of a \"dynamic theory of gravity\" that \"[would] put an end to idle speculations and false conceptions, as that of curved space\" was never found in [0]'s writings.", "On society": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] is widely considered by [0]'s biographers to have been a humanist in philosophical outlook. considered did not preclude [0], like many of [0]'s era, from becoming a proponent of an imposed selective breeding version of eugenics.[0] expressed the belief that human \"pity\" had come to interfere with the natural \"ruthless workings of nature\". Though [0]'s argumentation did not depend on a concept of a \"master race\" or the inherent superiority of one person over another, [0] advocated for eugenics. In a 1937 interview [0] stated:...\u00a0man's new sense of pity began to interfere with the natural \"ruthless workings of nature\". The only method compatible with our notions of civilization and the race is to prevent the breeding of the unfit by sterilization and the deliberate guidance of the mating instinct\u00a0... The trend of opinion among eugenists is that we must make marriage more difficult. Certainly no one who is not a desirable parent should be permitted to produce progeny. A century from now it will no more occur to a normal person to mate with a person eugenically unfit than to marry a habitual criminal. In 1926, [0] commented on the ills of the social subservience of women and the struggle of women toward gender equality, and indicated that humanity's future would be run by \"Queen Bees\". [0] believed that women would become the dominant sex in the future.[0] made predictions about the relevant issues of a post-World War I environment in a printed article entitled \"Science and Discovery are the great Forces which will lead to the Consummation of the War\" (20 December 1914).

[0] was raised an Orthodox Christian. Later in life [0] did not consider [0] to be a \"believer in the orthodox sense\", said [0] opposed religious fanaticism, and said \"Buddhism and Christianity are the greatest religions both in number of disciples and in importance.\" [0] also said \"To [0], the universe is simply a great machine which never came into being and never will end\" and \"what we call 'soul' or 'spirit,' is nothing more than the sum of the functionings of the body. When the functionings of the body ceases, the 'soul' or the 'spirit' ceases likewise.\"", "": ""}, "Literary works": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on.
