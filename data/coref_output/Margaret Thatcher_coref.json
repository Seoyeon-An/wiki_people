Margaret Hilda Thatcher, Baroness Thatcher, LG, OM, DStJ, PC, FRS, HonFRSC (n\u00e9e\u00a0Roberts; 13\u00a0October 1925\u00a0\u2013 8\u00a0April 2013), was a British stateswoman and Conservative politician who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1979 to [0] and Leader of the Conservative Party from 1975 to [0]. Margaret Thatcher was the first female British prime minister and the longest-serving of the 20th century. As prime minister, Margaret Thatcher implemented economic policies that became known as Thatcherism. A Soviet journalist dubbed Margaret Thatcher the \"Iron Lady\", a nickname that became associated with Margaret Thatcher's uncompromising politics and leadership style.Margaret Thatcher studied chemistry at Somerville College, Oxford, and worked briefly as a research chemist before becoming a barrister. Margaret Thatcher was elected Member of Parliament for Finchley in 1959. Edward Heath appointed Margaret Thatcher's Secretary of State for Education and Science in Edward Heath's 1970\u20131974 government. In 1975, Margaret Thatcher defeated Edward Heath in the the Conservative Party leadership election to become Leader of the Conservative Party, the first woman to lead a major political party in the United Kingdom.On becoming prime minister after winning the 1979 general election, Margaret Thatcher introduced a series of economic policies intended to reverse high inflation and the United Kingdom's struggles in the wake of the Winter of Discontent and an oncoming recession.[nb 1] Margaret Thatcher's political philosophy and economic policies emphasised deregulation (particularly of the financial sector), the privatisation of state-owned companies, and reducing the power and influence of trade unions. Margaret Thatcher's popularity in Margaret Thatcher's first years in office waned amid recession and rising unemployment. Victory in the 1982 Falklands War and the recovering economy brought a resurgence of support, resulting in Margaret Thatcher's landslide re-election in 1983. Margaret Thatcher survived an assassination attempt by the Provisional IRA in the 1984 Brighton hotel bombing and achieved a political victory against the National Union of Mineworkers in the 1984\u201385 miners' strike.Margaret Thatcher was re-elected for a third term with another landslide in 1987, but Margaret Thatcher's subsequent support for the Community Charge (also known as the \"poll tax\") was widely unpopular, and Margaret Thatcher's increasingly Eurosceptic views on the European Community were not shared by others in Margaret Thatcher's cabinet. Margaret Thatcher resigned as prime minister and party leader in [0], after a challenge was launched to Margaret Thatcher's leadership, and was succeeded by John Major, the Chancellor of the Exchequer.[nb 2] After retiring from the Commons in 1992, Margaret Thatcher was given a life peerage as Baroness Thatcher (of Kesteven in the County of Lincolnshire) which entitled Margaret Thatcher to sit in the House of Lords. In 2013, Margaret Thatcher died of a stroke at the Ritz Hotel, London, at the age of 87.A polarising figure in British politics, Margaret Thatcher is nonetheless viewed favourably in historical rankings and public opinion of British prime ministers. Margaret Thatcher's tenure constituted a realignment towards neoliberal policies in Britain, and the complex legacy attributed to a realignment towards neoliberal policies in Britain has been debated into the 21st century."}, "Early life and education": {"Family and childhood (1925\u20131943)": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was born on 13\u00a0October 1925 in Grantham, Lincolnshire. [0]'s parents were Alfred Roberts (1892\u20131970), from Northamptonshire, and Beatrice Ethel Stephenson (1888\u20131960), from Lincolnshire. Alfred Roberts (1892\u20131970), from Northamptonshire,'s maternal grandmother, Catherine Sullivan, was born in County Kerry, Ireland.[0] spent [0]'s childhood in Grantham, LincolnshireAlfred Roberts (1892\u20131970), from Northamptonshire, . In 1938, before the Second World War, the Roberts family briefly gave sanctuary to a teenage Jewish girl who had escaped Nazi Germany. With [0]'s pen-friending elder sister Muriel, [0] saved pocket money to help pay for a teenage Jewish girl who had escaped Nazi Germany's journey.Alfred Roberts (1892\u20131970), from Northamptonshire, was an alderman and a Methodist local preacher. Alfred Roberts (1892\u20131970), from Northamptonshire, brought up Alfred Roberts (1892\u20131970), from Northamptonshire,'s as a strict Wesleyan Methodist, attending the Finkin Street Methodist Church, but [0] was more sceptical; [0] told a friend that [0] could not believe in angels, having calculated that angels needed a breastbone 6 feet (1.8\u00a0m) long to support wings. Alfred Roberts (1892\u20131970), from Northamptonshire, came from a Liberal family but stood (as was then customary in local government) as an Independent. Alfred Roberts (1892\u20131970), from Northamptonshire, served as Mayor of Grantham, Lincolnshire from 1945 to 1946 and lost Alfred Roberts (1892\u20131970), from Northamptonshire,'s position as alderman in 1952 after the Labour Party won the Labour Party's first majority on Grantham Council in [0] attended Huntingtower Road Primary School and won a scholarship to Kesteven and Grantham Girls' School, a grammar school. [0]'s school reports showed hard work and continual improvement; [0]'s extracurricular activities included the piano, field hockey, poetry recitals, swimming and walking. [0] was head girl in 1942\u201343, and outside school, while the Second World War was ongoing, [0] voluntarily worked as a fire watcher in the local ARP service. Other students thought of [0] as the \"star scientist\". In [0]'s upper sixth year, [0] was accepted for a scholarship to study chemistry at Somerville College, Oxford, a women's college, starting in 1944. After another candidate withdrew, [0] entered Somerville College, Oxford, a women's college in October 1943.", "Oxford (1943\u20131947)": "Margaret Thatcher is our person to focus on. [0] arrived at Oxford in 1943 and graduated in 1947 with a second-class degree in chemistry, after specialising in X-ray crystallography under the supervision of Dorothy Hodgkin. [0]'s dissertation was on the structure of the antibiotic gramicidin. [0] also received the degree of Master of Arts in 1950 (as an Oxford BA, [0] was entitled to the degree of Master of Arts 21 terms after [0]'s matriculation). [0] did not only study chemistry as [0] intended to be a chemist only for a short period of time, already thinking about law and politics. [0] was reportedly prouder of becoming the first prime minister with a science degree than becoming the first female prime minister. While prime minister [0] attempted to preserve Somerville as a women's college. Twice a week outside study [0] worked in a local forces canteen.During [0]'s time at Oxford, [0] was noted for [0]'s isolated and serious attitude. Her first boyfriend, Tony Bray (1926\u20132014), recalled that [0] was \"very thoughtful and a very good conversationalist. That's probably what interested Her first boyfriend, Tony Bray (1926\u20132014). [0] was good at general subjects\". [0]'s enthusiasm for politics as a girl made Her first boyfriend, Tony Bray (1926\u20132014) think of [0] as \"unusual\" and [0]'s parents as \"slightly austere\" and \"very proper\".[0] became President of the Oxford University Conservative Association in 1946. [0] was influenced at university by political works such as Friedrich Hayek's The Road to Serfdom (1944), which condemned economic intervention by government as a precursor to an authoritarian state.", "Post-Oxford career (1947\u20131951)": "Margaret Thatcher is our person to focus on. After graduating, [0] moved to Colchester in Essex to work as a research chemist for BX Plastics. In 1948, [0] applied for a job at Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) but was rejected after the personnel department assessed [0] as \"headstrong, obstinate and dangerously self-opinionated\". Jon Agar in Notes and Records argues that [0]'s understanding of modern scientific research later impacted [0]'s views as prime minister.[0] joined the local Conservative Association and attended the party conference at Llandudno, Wales, in 1948, as a representative of the University Graduate Conservative Association.  Meanwhile, [0] became a high-ranking affiliate of the Vermin Club, a group of grassroots Conservatives formed in response to a derogatory comment made by Aneurin Bevan. One of [0]'s Oxford friends was also a friend of the Chair of the Dartford Conservative Association in Kent, who were looking for candidates. Officials of the association the Dartford Conservative Association in Kent, who were looking for candidates were so impressed by [0] that Officials of the association asked [0] to apply, even though [0] was not on the party's approved list; [0] was selected in January 1950 (aged 24) and added to the party's approved list post ante.At a dinner following [0]'s formal adoption as Conservative candidate for Dartford in February 1949, [0] met divorc\u00e9 Denis Thatcher, a successful and wealthy businessman, who drove her to her Essex train. After their first meeting, [0] described divorc\u00e9 Denis Thatcher, a successful and wealthy businessman, who drove her to her Essex train to Muriel as \"not a very attractive creature \u2013 very reserved but quite nice\". In preparation for the election, [0] moved to Dartford, where [0] supported [0] by working as a research chemist for J. Lyons and Co. in Hammersmith, part of a team developing emulsifiers for ice cream.

In the 1950 and 1951 general elections, [0] was the Conservative candidate for the Labour seat of Dartford. The local party selected [0] as The local party's candidate because, though not a dynamic public speaker, [0] was well-prepared and fearless in [0]'s answers. A prospective candidate, Bill Deedes, recalled: \"Once [0] opened [0]'s mouth, the rest of us began to look rather second-rate.\" [0] attracted media attention as the youngest and the only female candidate; in 1950, [0] was the youngest Conservative candidate in the country. [0] lost on both occasions to Norman Dodds but reduced the Labour majority by 6,000 and then a further 1,000. During the campaigns, [0] was supported by [0]'s parents and by her future husband Denis Thatcher, whom she married in December 1951. her future husband Denis Thatcher, whom she married in December 1951 funded her future husband Denis Thatcher, whom she married in December 1951's studies for the bar; [0] qualified as a barrister in 1953 and specialised in taxation.

In 1954, [0] was defeated when [0] sought selection to be the Conservative Party candidate for the Orpington by-election of January 1955. [0] chose not to stand as a candidate in the 1955 general election, in later years, stating: \"[0] really just felt the twins were [...] only two, [0] really felt that it was too soon. [0] couldn't do stand.\" Afterwards, [0] began looking for a Conservative safe seat and was selected as the candidate for Finchley in April 1958 (narrowly beating Ian Montagu Fraser). [0] was elected as MP for Finchley after a hard campaign in the 1959 election. Benefiting from [0]'s fortunate result in a lottery for backbenchers to propose new legislation, [0]'s maiden speech was, unusually, in support of her private member's bill, the Public Bodies (Admission to Meetings) Act 1960, requiring local authorities to hold their council meetings in public; her private member's bill, the Public Bodies (Admission to Meetings) Act 1960, requiring local authorities to hold their council meetings in public was successful and became law. In 1961 [0] went against Conservative Party's official position by voting for the restoration of birching as a judicial corporal punishment.[0]'s talent and drive caused [0] to be mentioned as a future prime minister in [0]'s early 20s although [0] [0] was more pessimistic, stating as late as 1970: \"There will not be a woman prime minister in [0]'s lifetime \u2013 the male population is too prejudiced.\" In October 1961 [0] was promoted to the frontbench as Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry for Pensions by Harold Macmillan. [0] was the youngest woman in history to receive such a post, and among the first MPs elected in 1959 to be promoted. After Conservative Party lost the 1964 election, [0] became spokeswoman on housing and land. In spokeswoman on housing and land, [0] advocated Conservative Party's policy of giving tenants the Right to Buy tenants's council houses. [0] moved to the Shadow Treasury team in 1966 and, as Treasury spokeswoman, opposed Labour's mandatory price and income controls, arguing Labour's mandatory price and income controls would unintentionally produce effects that would distort the economy.Jim Prior suggested [0] as a Shadow Cabinet member after Conservative Party's 1966 defeat, but party leader Edward Heath and Chief Whip William Whitelaw eventually chose Mervyn Pike as the Conservative Shadow Cabinet's's sole woman member. At the 1966 Conservative Party conference, [0] criticised the high-tax policies of Labour's as being steps \"not only towards Socialism, but towards Communism\", arguing that lower taxes served as an incentive to hard work. [0] was one of the few Conservative MPs to support Leo Abse's bill to decriminalise male homosexuality. [0] voted in favour of David Steel's bill to legalise abortion, as well as a ban on hare coursing. [0] supported the retention of capital punishment and voted against the relaxation of divorce laws.In 1967, the United States Embassy chose [0] to take part in the International Visitor Leadership Program (then called the Foreign Leader Program), a professional exchange programme that allowed [0] to spend about six weeks visiting various US cities and political figures as well as institutions such as the International Monetary Fund. Although [0] was not yet a Shadow Cabinet member, the United States Embassy reportedly described [0] to the State Department as a possible future prime minister. described helped [0] meet with prominent people during a busy itinerary focused on economic issues, including Paul Samuelson, Walt Rostow, Pierre-Paul Schweitzer and Nelson Rockefeller. Following the visit, party leader Edward Heath appointed [0] to the Conservative Shadow Cabinet's as fuel and power spokeswoman. Before the 1970 general election, [0] was promoted to shadow transport spokeswoman and later to education.In 1968, Enoch Powell delivered his \"Rivers of Blood\" speech in which he strongly criticised Commonwealth immigration to the United Kingdom and the then-proposed Race Relations Bill. When party leader Edward Heath telephoned [0] to inform [0] that party leader Edward Heath would sack Enoch Powell from the Conservative Shadow Cabinet's, [0] recalled that [0] \"really thought that it was better to let things cool down for the present rather than heighten the crisis\". [0] believed that Enoch Powell's main points about Commonwealth immigration to the United Kingdom were correct and that the selected quotations from his \"Rivers of Blood\" speech in which he strongly criticised Commonwealth immigration to the United Kingdom and the then-proposed Race Relations Bill had been taken out of context.  In a 1991 interview for Today, [0] stated that [0] thought Enoch Powell had \"made a valid argument, if in sometimes regrettable terms\".Around this time, [0] gave [0]'s first Commons speech as a shadow transport minister and highlighted the need for investment in British Rail. [0] argued: \"f we build bigger and better roads, bigger and better roads would soon be saturated with more vehicles and we would be no nearer solving the problem.\"  [0] made [0]'s first visit to the Soviet Union in the summer of 1969 as the Opposition transport spokeswoman, and in October, delivered a speech celebrating [0]'s ten years in Parliament. In early 1970, [0] told The Finchley Press that [0] would like to see a \"reversal of the permissive society\".", "Education Secretary (1970\u20131974)": "[0] is our person to focus on. The Conservative Party, led by Edward Heath, won the 1970 general election, and [0] was appointed to the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Education and Science. [0] caused controversy when, after only a few days in office, [0] withdrew Labour's's Circular 10/65, which attempted to force comprehensivisation, without going through a consultation process. [0] was highly criticised for the speed at which [0] carried withdrew out. Consequently, [0] drafted her own new policy (Circular 10/70), which ensured that local authorities were not forced to go comprehensive. her own new policy (Circular 10/70), which ensured that local authorities were not forced to go comprehensive was not meant to stop the development of new comprehensives; [0] said: \"We shall [...] expect plans to be based on educational considerations rather than on the comprehensive principle.[0] supported Lord Rothschild's 1971 proposal for market forces to affect government funding of research. Although many scientists opposed Lord Rothschild's 1971 proposal for market forces to affect government funding of research, [0]'s research background probably made [0] sceptical of many scientists's claim that outsiders should not interfere with funding. State evaluated proposals for more local education authorities to close grammar schools and to adopt comprehensive secondary education. Although [0] was committed to a tiered secondary modern-grammar school system of education and attempted to preserve grammar schools, during [0]'s tenure as education secretary, [0] turned down only 326 of 3,612\u00a0proposals (roughly 9 per cent) for schools to become comprehensives; the proportion of pupils attending comprehensive schools consequently rose from 32\u00a0per\u00a0cent to 62\u00a0per\u00a0cent. Nevertheless, [0] managed to save 94 grammar schools.During [0]'s first months in office, [0] attracted public attention due to the government's attempts to cut spending. [0] gave priority to academic needs in schools, while administering public expenditure cuts on the state education system, resulting in the abolition of free milk for schoolchildren aged seven to eleven. [0] held that few children would suffer if schools were charged for milk but agreed to provide younger children with 0.3 imperial pints (0.17\u00a0L)  daily for nutritional purposes. [0] also argued that [0] was simply carrying on with what Labour's had started since Labour's had stopped giving free milk to secondary schools. Milk would still be provided to those children that required Milk on medical grounds, and schools could still sell milk. The aftermath of the milk row hardened [0]'s determination; [0] told the editor-proprietor Harold Creighton of The Spectator: \"Don't underestimate [0], [0] saw how they broke Keith [Joseph], but they won't break [0].\"Cabinet papers later revealed that [0] opposed the policy but had been forced into the policy by the Treasury. [0]'s decision provoked a storm of protest from Labour and the press, leading to [0] being notoriously nicknamed \"Margaret Thatcher, Milk Snatcher\". [0] reportedly considered leaving politics in the aftermath and later wrote in [0]'s autobiography: \"[0] learned a valuable lesson. [0] had incurred the maximum of political odium for the minimum of political benefit.\"", "Leader of the Opposition (1975\u20131979)": "Margaret Thatcher is our person to focus on. The [0] government continued to experience difficulties with oil embargoes and union demands for wage increases in 1973, subsequently losing the February 1974 general election. Labour formed a minority government and went on to win a narrow majority in the October 1974 general election. Heath's leadership of the Conservative Party looked increasingly in doubt. Margaret Thatcher was not initially seen as the obvious replacement, but Margaret Thatcher eventually became the main challenger, promising a fresh start. Margaret Thatcher's main support came from the parliamentary 1922 Committee and The Spectator, but Margaret Thatcher's time in office gave Margaret Thatcher the reputation of a pragmatist rather than that of an ideologue. Margaret Thatcher defeated [0] on the first ballot, and [0] resigned from Heath's leadership of the Conservative Party. In the second ballot Margaret Thatcher defeated Whitelaw, Heath's preferred successor. Margaret Thatcher's election had a polarising effect on the Conservative Party; Margaret Thatcher's support was stronger among MPs on the right, and also among those from southern England, and those who had not attended public schools or Oxbridge.Margaret Thatcher became Conservative Party leader and Leader of the Opposition on 11\u00a0February 1975; Margaret Thatcher appointed Whitelaw, Heath's preferred successor as Margaret Thatcher's deputy. [0] was never reconciled to Margaret Thatcher's leadership of the Conservative Party.Television critic Clive James, writing in The Observer prior to Margaret Thatcher's election as Conservative Party leader, compared Margaret Thatcher's voice of 1973 to \"a cat sliding down a blackboard\".[nb 3] Margaret Thatcher had already begun to work on Margaret Thatcher's presentation on the advice of Gordon Reece, a former television producer. By chance, Gordon Reece, a former television producer met the actor Laurence Olivier, who arranged lessons with the National Theatre's voice coach.[nb 4]Thatcher began attending lunches regularly at the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA), a think tank founded by Hayekian poultry magnate Antony Fisher; Margaret Thatcher had been visiting the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA), a think tank founded by Hayekian poultry magnate Antony Fisher and reading the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA), a think tank founded by Hayekian poultry magnate Antony Fisher's publications since the early 1960s. There Margaret Thatcher was influenced by the ideas of Ralph Harris and Arthur Seldon and became the face of the ideological movement opposing the British welfare state. Keynesian economics, Ralph Harris and Arthur Seldon believed, was weakening Britain. the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA), a think tank founded by Hayekian poultry magnate Antony Fisher's pamphlets proposed less government, lower taxes, and more freedom for business and consumers.Margaret Thatcher intended to promote neoliberal economic ideas at home and abroad. Despite setting the direction of Margaret Thatcher's foreign policy for a Conservative government, Margaret Thatcher was distressed by Margaret Thatcher's repeated failure to shine in the House of Commons. Consequently, Margaret Thatcher decided that as \"Margaret Thatcher's voice was carrying little weight at home\", Margaret Thatcher would \"be heard in the wider world\". Margaret Thatcher undertook visits across the Atlantic, establishing an international profile and promoting Margaret Thatcher's economic and foreign policies. Margaret Thatcher toured the United States in 1975 and met President Gerald Ford, visiting again in 1977, when Margaret Thatcher met President Jimmy Carter. Among other foreign trips, Margaret Thatcher met Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi during a visit to Iran in 1978. Margaret Thatcher chose to travel without being accompanied by Margaret Thatcher's shadow foreign secretary, Reginald Maudling, in an attempt to make a bolder personal impact.In domestic affairs, Margaret Thatcher opposed Scottish devolution (home rule) and the creation of a Scottish Assembly. Margaret Thatcher instructed Conservative MPs to vote against the Scotland and Wales Bill in December 1976, which was successfully defeated, and then when new Bills were proposed, Margaret Thatcher supported amending the legislation to allow the English to vote in the 1979 referendum on Scottish devolution.Britain's economy during the 1970s was so weak that then Foreign Secretary James Callaghan warned his fellow Labour Cabinet members in 1974 of the possibility of \"a breakdown of democracy\", telling his fellow Labour Cabinet members: \"If then Foreign Secretary James Callaghan were a young man, then Foreign Secretary James Callaghan would emigrate.\" In mid-1978, Britain's economy began to recover, and opinion polls showed Labour in the lead, with a general election being expected later that year and a Labour win a serious possibility. Now prime minister, then Foreign Secretary James Callaghan surprised many by announcing on 7\u00a0September that there would be no general election that year and that then Foreign Secretary James Callaghan would wait until 1979 before going to the polls. Margaret Thatcher reacted to announcing by branding Labour \"chickens\", and Liberal Party leader David Steel joined in, criticising Labour for \"running scared\".Labour then faced fresh public unease about the direction of Britain and a damaging series of strikes during the winter of 1978\u201379, dubbed the \"Winter of Discontent\". The Conservatives attacked Labour's unemployment record, using advertising with the slogan \"Labour Isn't Working\". A general election was called after the then Foreign Secretary James Callaghan ministry lost a motion of no confidence in early 1979. The Conservatives won a 44-seat majority in the House of Commons, and Margaret Thatcher became the first female British prime minister.Margaret Thatcher stand before you tonight in Margaret Thatcher's Red Star chiffon evening gown, Margaret Thatcher's face softly made up and Margaret Thatcher's fair hair gently waved, Margaret Thatcher. In 1976, Margaret Thatcher gave Margaret Thatcher \"Britain Awake\" foreign policy speech which lambasted the Soviet Union, saying the Soviet Union was \"bent on world dominance\". The Soviet Army journal Red Star reported Margaret Thatcher's stance in a piece headlined \"Iron Lady Raises Fears\", alluding to Margaret Thatcher's remarks on the Iron Curtain. The Sunday Times covered the The Soviet Army journal Red Star article the next day, and Margaret Thatcher embraced the epithet a week later; in a speech to Finchley Conservatives Margaret Thatcher likened the epithet to the Duke of Wellington's nickname \"Iron Duke\". The \"Iron\" metaphor followed Margaret Thatcher throughout ever since, and would become a generic sobriquet for other strong-willed female politicians."}, "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (1979\u20131990)": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] became prime minister on 4\u00a0May 1979. Arriving at Downing Street [0] said, paraphrasing the Prayer of Saint Francis:Where there is discord, may we bring harmony;Where there is error, may we bring truth;Where there is doubt, may we bring faith;And where there is despair, may we bring hope.In office throughout the 1980s, [0] was frequently referred to as the most powerful woman in the world.", "Domestic affairs": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was the Opposition leader and prime minister at a time of increased racial tension in Britain. During the 1977 local elections, [0] commented: \"The Tory tide swamped the smaller parties\u00a0\u2013 specifically the National Front [NF], which suffered a clear decline from last year.\" [0]'s standing in the polls had risen by 11% after a 1978 interview for World in Action in which [0] said \"the British character has done so much for democracy, for law and done so much throughout the world that if there is any fear that the British character might be swamped people are going to react and be rather hostile to those coming in\", as well as \"in many ways [minorities] add to the richness and variety of Britain. The moment the minority threatens to become a big one, people get frightened\". In the 1979 general election, the Conservatives had attracted votes from the NF, whose support almost collapsed. In a July 1979 meeting with Foreign Secretary Lord Carrington and Home Secretary William Whitelaw, [0] objected to the number of Asian immigrants, in the context of limiting the total of Vietnamese boat people allowed to settle in the UK to fewer than 10,000 over two years.As prime minister, [0] met weekly with Queen Elizabeth\u00a0II to discuss government business, and their's relationship came under scrutiny. Campbell (2011a, p.\u00a0464) states:One question that continued to fascinate the public about the phenomenon of a woman Prime Minister was how [0] got on with Queen Elizabeth\u00a0II. The answer is that their's relations were punctiliously correct, but there was little love lost on either side. As two women of very similar age \u2013 [0] was six months older \u2013 occupying parallel positions at the top of the social pyramid, one the head of government, the other head of state, their were bound to be in some sense rivals. [0]'s attitude to Queen Elizabeth\u00a0II was ambivalent. On the one hand [0] had an almost mystical reverence for the institution of the monarchy [...] Yet at the same time [0] was trying to modernise Britain and sweep away many of the values and practices which the institution of the monarchy perpetuated. Michael Shea, the Queen's press secretary, in 1986 leaked stories of a deep rift to The Sunday Times.  Michael Shea, the Queen's press secretary said that Queen Elizabeth\u00a0II felt [0]'s policies were \"uncaring, confrontational and socially divisive\". [0] later wrote: \"[0] always found Queen Elizabeth\u00a0II's attitude towards the work of the Government absolutely correct [...] stories of clashes between 'two powerful women' were just too good not to make up.[0]'s economic policy was influenced by monetarist thinking and economists such as Milton Friedman and Alan Walters. Together with [0]'s first chancellor, Geoffrey Howe, [0] lowered direct taxes on income and increased indirect taxes. [0] increased interest rates to slow the growth of the money supply, and thereby lower inflation; introduced cash limits on public spending and reduced expenditure on social services such as education and housing. Cuts to higher education led to [0] being the first Oxonian post-war prime minister without an honorary doctorate from Oxford University after a 738\u2013319 vote of the governing assembly and a student petition.Some Heathite Conservatives in the Cabinet, the so-called \"wets\", expressed doubt over [0]'s policies. The 1981 England riots resulted in the British media discussing the need for a policy U-turn. At the 1980 Conservative Party conference, [0] addressed the issue directly with a speech written by the playwright Ronald Millar, that notably included the following lines: To those waiting with bated breath for that favourite media catchphrase, the \"U\" turn, [0] have only one thing to say. \"You turn if you want to. [0]'s not for turning.\" [0]'s job approval rating fell to 23% by December 1980, lower than recorded for any previous prime minister. As the recession of the early 1980s deepened, [0] increased taxes, despite concerns expressed in a March 1981 statement signed by 364\u00a0leading economists, which argued there was \"no basis in economic theory [...] for the Government's belief that by deflating demand the Government will bring inflation permanently under control\", adding that \"present policies will deepen the depression, erode the industrial base of our economy and threaten our economy's social and political stability\".By 1982, the UK began to experience signs of economic recovery; inflation was down to 8.6% from a high of 18%, but unemployment was over 3\u00a0million for the first time since the 1930s. By 1983, overall economic growth was stronger, and inflation and mortgage rates had fallen to inflation and mortgage rates's lowest levels in 13 years, although manufacturing employment as a share of total employment fell to just over 30%, with total unemployment remaining high, peaking at 3.3\u00a0million in 1984.During the 1982 Conservative Party Conference, [0] said: \"the Government have done more to roll back the frontiers of socialism than any previous Conservative Government.\" [0] said at the Party Conference the following year that the British people had completely rejected state socialism and understood \"the state has no source of money other than money which people earn people [...] There is no such thing as public money; there is only taxpayers' money.\"By 1987, unemployment was falling, our economy was stable and strong, and inflation was low. Opinion polls showed a comfortable Conservative lead, and local council election results had also been successful, prompting [0] to call a general election for 11\u00a0June 1987, despite the deadline for an election still being 12 months away. a general election saw [0] re-elected for a third successive term.[0] had been firmly opposed to British membership of the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM, a precursor to European Economic and Monetary Union), believing that the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM, a precursor to European Economic and Monetary Union) would constrain the British economy, despite the urging of both Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson and Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe; in October 1990 [0] was persuaded by John Major, Lawson's successor as chancellor, to join the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM, a precursor to European Economic and Monetary Union) at what proved to be too high a rate.[0] reformed local government taxes by replacing domestic rates (a tax based on the nominal rental value of a home) with the Community Charge (or poll tax) in which the same amount was charged to each adult resident. the Community Charge (or poll tax) in which the same amount was charged to each adult resident was introduced in Scotland in 1989 and in England and Wales the following year, and proved to be among the most unpopular policies of her premiership. Public disquiet culminated in a 70,000 to 200,000-strong demonstration in London in March 1990; a 70,000 to 200,000-strong demonstration in London in March 1990 deteriorated into riots, leaving 113 people injured and 340 under arrest. the Community Charge (or poll tax) in which the same amount was charged to each adult resident was abolished in 1991 by John Major, Lawson's successor as chancellor,. It has since transpired that [0] had failed to register for the Community Charge (or poll tax) in which the same amount was charged to each adult resident and was threatened with financial penalties if [0] did not return [0]'s form.[0] believed that the trade unions were harmful to both ordinary trade unionists and the public. [0] was committed to reducing the power of the unions, whose leadership [0] accused of undermining parliamentary democracy and economic performance through strike action. Several unions launched strikes in response to legislation introduced to limit Several unions's power, but resistance eventually collapsed. Only 39% of union members voted Labour in the 1979 general election. According to the BBC's's political correspondent in 2004, [0] \"managed to destroy the power of the trade unions for almost a generation\". The miners' strike of 1984\u201385 was the biggest and most devastating confrontation between the unions and the Government.In March 1984, the National Coal Board (NCB) proposed to close 20 of the 174\u00a0state-owned mines and cut 20,000\u00a0jobs out of 187,000. Two-thirds of Britain's miners, led by the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) under Arthur Scargill, downed tools in protest. However, Arthur Scargill refused to hold a ballot on The miners' strike of 1984\u201385, having previously lost three ballots on a national strike (in January and October 1982, and March 1983). lost led to The miners' strike of 1984\u201385 being declared illegal by the High Court of Justice.[0] refused to meet the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) under Arthur Scargill's demands and compared the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) under Arthur Scargill's dispute to the Falklands War, declaring in a speech in 1984: \"We had to fight the enemy without in the Falklands War. We always have to be aware of the enemy within, which is much more difficult to fight and more dangerous to liberty.\" [0]'s opponents misrepresented [0]'s words as indicating contempt for the working class and have been employed in criticism of [0] ever since.After a year out on strike in March 1985, the the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) under Arthur Scargill leadership conceded without a deal. The cost to our economy was estimated to be at least \u00a31.5\u00a0billion, and The miners' strike of 1984\u201385 was blamed for much of the pound's fall against the US dollar. [0] reflected on the end of The miners' strike of 1984\u201385 in [0]'s statement that \"if anyone has won\", anyone was \"the miners who stayed at work\" and all those \"that have kept Britain going\".the Government closed 25\u00a0unprofitable coal mines in 1985, and by 1992 a total of 97 mines had been closed; those that remained were privatised in 1994. The resulting closure of 150\u00a0coal mines, some of which were not losing money, resulted in the loss of tens of thousands of jobs and had the effect of devastating entire communities. Strikes had helped bring down Heath's's government, and [0] was determined to succeed where Heath's had failed. [0]'s strategy of preparing fuel stocks, appointing hardliner Ian MacGregor as the BBC's leader and ensuring that police were adequately trained and equipped with riot gear contributed to [0]'s triumph over the striking miners.The number of stoppages across the UK peaked at 4,583 in 1979, when more than 29\u00a0million working days had been lost. In 1984, the year of The miners' strike of 1984\u201385, there were 1,221, resulting in the loss of more than 27\u00a0million working days. Stoppages then fell steadily throughout the rest of her premiership; in 1990, there were 630 and fewer than 2\u00a0million working days lost, and Stoppages continued to fall thereafter. her premiership also witnessed a sharp decline in trade union density, with the percentage of workers belonging to a trade union falling from 57.3% in 1979, when more than 29\u00a0million working days had been lost to 49.5% in 1985. In 1979, when more than 29\u00a0million working days had been lost up until [0]'s final year in office, trade union membership also fell, from 13.5\u00a0million in 1979, when more than 29\u00a0million working days had been lost to fewer than 10\u00a0million.The policy of privatisation has been called \"a crucial ingredient of [0]\". After the 1983 election, the sale of state utilities accelerated; more than \u00a329\u00a0billion was raised from the sale of nationalised industries, and another \u00a318\u00a0billion from the sale of council houses. The process of privatisation, especially the preparation of nationalised industries for privatisation, was associated with marked improvements in performance, particularly in terms of labour productivity.Some of the privatised industries, including gas, water, and electricity, were natural monopolies for which privatisation involved little increase in competition. The privatised industries that demonstrated improvement sometimes did so while still under state ownership. British Steel Corporation had made great gains in profitability while still a nationalised industry under the government-appointed hardliner Ian MacGregor chairmanship, which faced down trade-union opposition to close plants and halve the workforce. Regulation was also significantly expanded to compensate for the loss of direct government control, with the foundation of regulatory bodies such as Oftel (1984), Ofgas (1986), and the National Rivers Authority (1989). There was no clear pattern to the degree of competition, regulation, and performance among the privatised industries.In most cases, privatisation benefited consumers in terms of lower prices and improved efficiency but results overall have been mixed. Not all privatised companies have had successful share price trajectories in the longer term. A 2010 review by World in Action states: \"t does seem to be the case that once competition and/or effective regulation was introduced, performance improved markedly [...] But I hasten to emphasise again that the literature is not unanimous.[0] always resisted privatising British Rail and was said to have told Transport Secretary Nicholas Ridley: \"Railway privatisation will be the Waterloo of the Government. Please never mention the railways to [0] again.\" Shortly before [0]'s resignation in 1990, [0] accepted the arguments for privatisation, which John Major, Lawson's successor as chancellor, implemented in 1994.The privatisation of public assets was combined with financial deregulation to fuel economic growth. Chancellor Geoffrey Howe abolished the UK's exchange controls in 1979, when more than 29\u00a0million working days had been lost, which allowed more capital to be invested in foreign markets, and the Big Bang of 1986 removed many restrictions on the London Stock Exchange.In 1980 and 1981, Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) and Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) prisoners in Northern Ireland's Maze Prison carried out hunger strikes to regain the status of political prisoners that had been removed in 1976 by the preceding Labour government. Bobby Sands began the 1981 strike, saying that Bobby Sands would fast until death unless prison inmates won concessions over prison inmates's living conditions. [0] refused to countenance a return to political status for Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) and Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) prisoners in Northern Ireland's Maze Prison, having declared \"Crime is crime is crime; Crime is not political\". Nevertheless, the Government privately contacted republican leaders in a bid to bring hunger strikes to an end. After the deaths of Bobby Sands and nine others, the 1981 strike ended. Some rights were restored to paramilitary prisoners, but not official recognition of political status. Violence in Northern Ireland's escalated significantly during hunger strikes.[0] narrowly escaped injury in an IRA assassination attempt at a Brighton hotel early in the morning on 12\u00a0October 1984. Five people were killed, including the wife of minister John Wakeham. [0] was staying at a Brighton hotel to prepare for the Conservative Party conference, which [0] insisted should open as scheduled the following day. [0] delivered [0]'s speech as planned, though rewritten from [0]'s original draft, in a move that was supported across the political spectrum and enhanced [0]'s popularity with the public.On 6\u00a0November 1981, Thatcher and Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Garret FitzGerald had established the Anglo-Irish Inter-Governmental Council, a forum for meetings between the two governments. On 15\u00a0November 1985, Thatcher and Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Garret FitzGerald signed the Hillsborough Anglo-Irish Agreement, which marked the first time a British government had given Britain an advisory role in the governance of Northern Ireland's. In protest, the Ulster Says No movement led by Ian Paisley attracted 100,000 to a rally in Belfast, Ian Gow, later assassinated by the PIRA, resigned as Minister of State in the HM Treasury, and all 15 Unionist MPs resigned all 15 Unionist MPs's parliamentary seats; only one was not returned in the subsequent by-elections on 23\u00a0January 1986.", "Environment": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] supported an active climate protection policy; [0] was instrumental in the passing of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, the founding of the Hadley Centre for Climate Research and Prediction, the establishment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and the ratification of the Montreal Protocol on preserving the ozone.[0] helped to put climate change, acid rain and general pollution in the British mainstream in the late 1980s, calling for a global treaty on climate change in 1989. [0]'s speeches included one to the Royal Society in 1988, followed by another to the UN General Assembly in 1989.", "Foreign affairs": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] appointed Lord Carrington, an ennobled member of the party and former Secretary of State for Defence, to run the Foreign Office in 1979. Although considered a \"wet\", Lord Carrington, an ennobled member of the party and former Secretary of State for Defence, avoided domestic affairs and got along well with [0]. One issue was what to do with Rhodesia, where the white minority had determined to rule the prosperous, black-majority breakaway colony in the face of overwhelming international criticism. With the 1975 Portuguese collapse in the continent, South Africa (which had been Rhodesia's chief supporter) realised that South Africa (which had been Rhodesia's chief supporter)'s was a liability; black rule was inevitable, and the Thatcher government brokered a peaceful solution to end the Rhodesian Bush War in December 1979 via the Lancaster House Agreement. The conference at Lancaster House was attended by Rhodesian prime minister Ian Smith, as well as by the key black leaders: Muzorewa, Mugabe, Nkomo and Tongogara. The result was the new Zimbabwean nation under black rule in [0]'s first foreign-policy crisis came with the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. [0] condemned the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, said the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan showed the bankruptcy of a d\u00e9tente policy and helped convince some British athletes to boycott the 1980 Moscow Olympics. [0] gave weak support to US president Jimmy Carter who tried to punish the USSR with economic sanctions. Britain's's economic situation was precarious, and most of NATO was reluctant to cut trade ties. [0] nevertheless gave the go-ahead for Whitehall to approve MI6 (along with the SAS) to undertake \"disruptive action\" in Afghanistan. As well working with the CIA in Operation Cyclone, MI6 also supplied weapons, training and intelligence to the mujaheddin.The Financial Times reported in 2011 that Britain's had secretly supplied Iraq under Saddam Hussein with \"non-lethal\" military equipment since 1981.Having withdrawn formal recognition from the Pol Pot regime in 1979, the Thatcher government backed the Khmer Rouge keeping the Khmer Rouge's UN seat after the Khmer Rouge were ousted from power in Cambodia by the Cambodian\u2013Vietnamese War. Although [0] denied backed at the time, it was revealed in 1991 that, while not directly training any Khmer Rouge, from 1983 the Special Air Service (SAS) was sent to secretly train \"the armed forces of the Cambodian non-communist resistance\" that remained loyal to Prince Norodom Sihanouk and Prince Norodom Sihanouk's former prime minister Son Sann in the fight against the Vietnamese-backed puppet regime.[0] was one of the first Western leaders to respond warmly to reformist Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. Following Reagan\u2013reformist Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev summit meetings and reforms enacted by reformist Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in the USSR, [0] declared in November 1988 that \"e're not in a Cold War now\" but rather in a \"new relationship much wider than the Cold War ever was\". [0] went on a state visit to the Soviet Union in 1984 and met with reformist Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and Council of Ministers chairman Nikolai Ryzhkov.Despite opposite personalities, [0] bonded quickly with US president Ronald Reagan.[nb 5] [0] gave strong support to the Reagan administration's's Cold War policies based on the Reagan administration's's shared distrust of communism. A sharp disagreement came in 1983 when Reagan did not consult with [0] on the invasion of Grenada.During [0]'s first year as prime minister, [0] supported NATO's decision to deploy US nuclear cruise and Pershing II missiles in Western Europe, permitting the US to station more than 160\u00a0cruise missiles at RAF Greenham Common, starting in November 1983 and triggering mass protests by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. [0] bought the Trident nuclear missile submarine system from the US to replace Polaris, tripling the UK's's nuclear forces at an eventual cost of more than \u00a312\u00a0billion (at 1996\u201397 prices). [0]'s preference for defence ties with the US was demonstrated in the Westland affair of 1985\u201386 when [0] acted with colleagues to allow the struggling helicopter manufacturer Westland to refuse a takeover offer from the Italian firm Agusta in favour of the management's preferred option, a link with Sikorsky Aircraft. Defence Secretary Michael Heseltine, who had supported a takeover offer from the Italian firm Agusta, resigned from the Thatcher government in protest.In April 1986 [0] permitted US F-111s to use Royal Air Force bases for the bombing of Libya in retaliation for the alleged Libyan bombing of a Berlin discoth\u00e8que, citing the right of self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter.[nb 6] Polls suggested that fewer than one in three British citizens approved of [0]'s decision.[0] was in the US on a state visit when Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in August 1990. During [0]'s talks with President George H. W. Bush, who succeeded Reagan in 1989, [0] recommended intervention, and put pressure on President George H. W. Bush, who succeeded Reagan in 1989 to deploy troops in the Middle East to drive the Iraqi Army out of Kuwait. President George H. W. Bush, who succeeded Reagan in 1989 was apprehensive about the plan, prompting [0] to remark to President George H. W. Bush, who succeeded Reagan in 1989 during a telephone conversation: \"This was no time to go wobbly!\" Britain's supplied military forces to the international coalition in the build-up to the Gulf War, but [0] had resigned by the time hostilities began on 17\u00a0January 1991. [0] applauded the coalition victory on the backbenches, while warning that \"the victories of peace will take longer than the battles of war\". It was disclosed in 2017 that [0] had suggested threatening Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein with chemical weapons after invaded.On 2\u00a0April 1982, the ruling military junta in Argentina ordered the invasion of the British possessions of the Falkland Islands and South Georgia, triggering the Falklands War. The subsequent crisis was \"a defining moment of [0]'s] premiership\". At the suggestion of Harold Macmillan and Robert Armstrong, [0] set up and chaired a small War Cabinet (formally called ODSA, Overseas and Defence committee, South Atlantic) to oversee the conduct of the Falklands War, which by 5\u20136\u00a0April had authorised and dispatched a naval task force to retake the Falkland Islands. Argentina surrendered on 14\u00a0June and Operation Corporate was hailed a success, notwithstanding the deaths of 255\u00a0British servicemen and three Falkland Islanders. Argentine fatalities totalled 649, half of Argentine fatalities after the nuclear-powered submarine HMS\u00a0Conqueror torpedoed and sank the cruiser ARA\u00a0General Belgrano on 2\u00a0May.[0] was criticised for the neglect of the Falkland Islands's defence that led to the Falklands War, and especially by Labour MP Tam Dalyell in Parliament for the decision to torpedo the cruiser ARA\u00a0General Belgrano, but overall, [0] was considered a competent and committed war leader. The \"the Falkland Islands factor\", an economic recovery beginning early in 1982, and a bitterly divided opposition all contributed to [0]'s second election victory in 1983. [0] frequently referred after the Falklands War to the \"Falklands spirit\"; Hastings & Jenkins (1983, p.\u00a0329) suggests that referred reflected [0]'s preference for the streamlined decision-making of her War Cabinet over the painstaking deal-making of peacetime cabinet government.In September 1982, [0] visited China to discuss with Deng Xiaoping the sovereignty of Hong Kong after 1997. China was the first communist state [0] had visited as prime minister, and [0] was the first British prime minister to visit China. Throughout their meeting, [0] sought China's agreement to a continued British presence in Hong Kong. Deng Xiaoping insisted that China's sovereignty over Hong Kong was non-negotiable but stated Deng Xiaoping's willingness to settle the sovereignty issue with Britain's through formal negotiations. Both governments promised to maintain Hong Kong's stability and prosperity. After the two-year negotiations, [0] conceded to China and signed the Sino-British Joint Declaration in Beijing in 1984, agreeing to hand over Hong Kong's sovereignty in 1997.Despite saying that [0] was in favour of \"peaceful negotiations\" to end apartheid, [0] opposed sanctions imposed on South Africa by the Commonwealth and the European Economic Community (EEC). [0] attempted to preserve trade with South Africa while persuading South Africa to abandon apartheid. attempted included \"asting [0] as President Botha's's candid friend\" and inviting President Botha's to visit the UK's in 1984, despite the \"inevitable demonstrations\" against President Botha's's . Alan Merrydew of the Canadian broadcaster BCTV News asked [0] what [0]'s response was \"to a reported ANC statement that ANC will target British firms in South Africa?\" to which [0] later replied: \"[...] when ANC says that ANC will target British companies [...] says shows what a typical terrorist organisation ANC is. [0] fought terrorism all [0]'s life and if more people fought terrorism, and we were all more successful, we should not have terrorism and [0] hope that everyone in this hall will think it is right to go on fighting terrorism.\" During his's visit to Britain's five months after his's release from prison, his praised [0]: \"[0] is an enemy of apartheid [...] We have much to thank [0] for.[0] and the party supported British membership of the European Economic Community (EEC) in the 1975 national referendum and the Single European Act of 1986, and obtained the UK rebate on contributions, but [0] believed that the role of the European Economic Community (EEC) should be limited to ensuring free trade and effective competition, and feared that the the European Economic Community (EEC) approach was at odds with [0]'s views on smaller government and deregulation. Believing that the single market would result in political integration, [0]'s opposition to further European integration became more pronounced during [0]'s premiership and particularly after [0]'s third government in 1987. In [0]'s Bruges speech in 1988, [0] outlined [0]'s opposition to proposals from the European Economic Community (EEC), for a federal structure and increased centralisation of decision-making: We have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain, only to see the frontiers of the state in Britain re-imposed at a European level, with a European super-state exercising a new dominance from Brussels. Sharing the concerns of French president Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, [0] was initially opposed to German reunification,[nb 7] telling reformist Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev that German reunification,[nb 7] \"would lead to a change to postwar borders, and we cannot allow lead because such a development would undermine the stability of the whole international situation and could endanger our security\". [0] expressed concern that a united Germany would align a united Germany more closely with the Soviet Union and move away from NATO.In March 1990, [0] held a Chequers seminar on the subject of German reunification that was attended by members of her War Cabinet and historians such as Norman Stone, George Urban, Timothy Garton Ash and Gordon A. Craig. During a Chequers seminar on the subject of German reunification, [0] described \"what George Urban called 'saloon bar clich\u00e9s' about the German character, including 'angst, aggressiveness, assertiveness, bullying, egotism, inferiority complex [and] sentimentality'\". Those present were shocked to hear Thatcher's utterances and \"appalled\" at how [0] was \"apparently unaware\" about the post-war German collective guilt and Germans''s attempts to work through Germans''s past. The words of their meeting were leaked by [0]'s foreign-policy advisor Charles Powell and, subsequently, Thatcher's utterances were met with fierce backlash and controversy.During the same month, German chancellor Helmut Kohl reassured [0] that German chancellor Helmut Kohl would keep [0] \"informed of all German chancellor Helmut Kohl's intentions about unification\", and that German chancellor Helmut Kohl was prepared to disclose \"matters which her War Cabinet German chancellor Helmut Kohl's would not know\".", "Challenges to leadership and resignation": "[0] is our person to focus on. During [0]'s premiership, [0] had the second-lowest average approval rating (40%) of any post-war prime minister. Since Nigel Lawson's's resignation as chancellor in October 1989, polls consistently showed that [0] was less popular than her party. A self-described conviction politician, [0] always insisted that [0] did not care about [0]'s poll ratings and pointed instead to [0]'s unbeaten election record.In December 1989, [0] was challenged for the leadership of the Conservative Party by the little-known backbench MP Sir Anthony Meyer. Of the 374 Conservative MPs eligible to vote, 314 voted for [0] and 33 for the little-known backbench MP Sir Anthony Meyer. [0]'s supporters in her party viewed voted as a success and rejected suggestions that there was discontent within her party.Opinion polls in September 1990 reported that Labour had established a 14% lead over her party, and by November, her party had been trailing Labour for 18\u00a0months. These ratings, together with [0]'s combative personality and tendency to override collegiate opinion, contributed to further discontent within her party.In July 1989, [0] removed Geoffrey Howe as foreign secretary after Geoffrey Howe and Nigel Lawson's had forced [0] to agree to a plan for Britain to join the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM). Britain joined the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) in October 1990.On 1\u00a0November 1990, Howe, by then the last remaining member of [0]'s original 1979 cabinet, resigned as deputy prime minister, ostensibly over [0]'s open hostility to moves towards European monetary union. In Geoffrey Howe's resignation speech on 13November, which was instrumental in [0]'s downfall, Geoffrey Howe attacked [0]'s openly dismissive attitude to the government's proposal for a new European currency competing against existing currencies (a \"hard ECU\"):How on earth are the Chancellor and the Governor of the Bank of England, commending a new European currency competing against existing currencies as the Chancellor and the Governor of the Bank of England strive to, to be taken as serious participants in the debate against that kind of background noise? Geoffrey Howe believe that the Chancellor and the Governor of the Bank of England are cricketing enthusiasts, so Geoffrey Howe hope that there is no monopoly of cricketing metaphors. It is rather like sending your opening batsmen to the crease only for your opening batsmen to find, the moment the first balls are bowled, that your opening batsmen's bats have been broken before the game by the team captain. On 14\u00a0November, Michael Heseltine mounted a challenge for the leadership of the Conservative Party. Opinion polls had indicated that Michael Heseltine would give her party a national lead over Labour. Although [0] led on the first ballot with the votes of 204 Conservative MPs (54.8%) to 152 votes (40.9%) for Michael Heseltine, with 16 abstentions, [0] was four votes short of the required 15% majority. A second ballot was therefore necessary. [0] initially declared [0]'s intention to \"fight on and fight to win\" A second ballot, but consultation with [0]'s cabinet persuaded [0] to withdraw. After holding an audience with the Queen, calling other world leaders, and making one final Commons speech, on 28\u00a0November [0] left Downing Street in tears. [0] reportedly regarded [0]'s ousting as a betrayal. [0]'s was a shock to many outside Britain, with such foreign observers as Henry Kissinger and Gorbachev expressing private consternation.Chancellor John Major replaced [0] as head of government and party leader, whose lead over Michael Heseltine in A second ballot was sufficient for Michael Heseltine to drop out. Chancellor John Major oversaw an upturn in Conservative support in the 17\u00a0months leading to the 1992 general election and led her party to a fourth successive victory on 9\u00a0April 1992. [0] had lobbied for Chancellor John Major in a challenge for the leadership of the Conservative Party, but [0]'s support for Chancellor John Major waned in later years."}, "Later life": {"Return to backbenches (1990\u20131992)": "[0] is our person to focus on. After leaving the premiership, [0] returned to the backbenches as a constituency parliamentarian. [0]'s domestic approval rating recovered after [0]'s resignation, though public opinion remained divided on whether [0]'s government had been good for the country. Aged 66, [0] retired from the House of Commons at the 1992 general election, saying that leaving the House of Commons would allow [0] more freedom to speak [0]'s mind.", "Post-Commons (1992\u20132003)": "[0] is our person to focus on. On leaving the Commons, [0] became the first former British prime minister to set up a foundation; the British wing of a foundation was dissolved in 2005 due to financial difficulties. [0] wrote two volumes of memoirs, The Downing Street Years (1993) and The Path to Power (1995). In 1991, [0] and her husband Denis moved to a house in Chester Square, a residential garden square in central London's Belgravia district.[0] was hired by the tobacco company Philip Morris as a \"geopolitical consultant\" in July 1992 for $250,000 per year and an annual contribution of $250,000 to a foundation. [0] earned $50,000 for each speech [0] delivered.[0] became an advocate of Croatian and Slovenian independence. Commenting on the Yugoslav Wars, in a 1991 interview for Croatian Radiotelevision, [0] was critical of Western governments for not recognising the breakaway republics of Croatia and Slovenia as independent and for not supplying the breakaway republics of Croatia and Slovenia with arms after the Serbian-led Yugoslav Army attacked.In August 1992, [0] called for NATO to stop the Serbian assault on Gora\u017ede and Sarajevo to end ethnic cleansing during the Bosnian War, comparing the situation in Bosnia\u2013Herzegovina to \"the barbarities of Hitler's and Stalin's\".[0] made a series of speeches in the Lords criticising the Maastricht Treaty, describing the Maastricht Treaty as \"a treaty too far\" and stated: \"[0] could never have signed the Maastricht Treaty.\" [0] cited A. V. Dicey when arguing that, as all three main parties were in favour of the Maastricht Treaty, the people should have the people's say in a referendum.[0] served as honorary chancellor of the College of William & Mary in Virginia from 1993 to 2000, while also serving as chancellor of the private University of Buckingham from 1992 to 1998, a university [0] had formally opened in 1976 as the former education secretary.After Tony Blair's's election as Labour Party leader in 1994, [0] praised Tony Blair's as \"probably the most formidable Labour leader since Hugh Gaitskell\", adding: \"[0] see a lot of socialism behind Labour Party's front bench, but not in Tony Blair's. [0] think Tony Blair's genuinely has moved.\" Tony Blair's responded in kind: \"[0] was a thoroughly determined person, and a thoroughly determined person is an admirable quality.\"In 1998, [0] called for the release of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet when Spain had former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet arrested and sought to try former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet for human rights violations. [0] cited the help former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet gave Britain during the Falklands War.

Thatcherism represented a systematic and decisive overhaul of the post-war consensus, whereby the major political parties largely agreed on the central themes of Keynesianism, the welfare state, nationalised industry, and close regulation of the economy, and high taxes. [0] generally supported the welfare state while proposing to rid the welfare state of abuses.[nb 8]She promised in 1982 that the highly popular National Health Service was \"safe in our hands\". At first, [0] ignored the question of privatising nationalised industries; heavily influenced by right-wing think tanks, and especially by Sir Keith Joseph, [0] broadened [0]'s attack. Thatcherism came to refer to her policies as well as aspects of [0]'s ethical outlook and personal style, including moral absolutism, nationalism, liberal individualism, and an uncompromising approach to achieving political goals.[nb 9]Thatcher defined [0]'s political philosophy, in a major and controversial break with the one-nation conservatism of [0]'s predecessor Edward Heath, in a 1987 interview published in Woman's Own magazine:[0] think we have gone through a period when too many children and people have been given to understand \"I have a problem, it is the Government's job to cope with a problem!\" or \"I have a problem, I will go and get a grant to cope with a problem!\" \"I am homeless, the Government must house I!\" and so too many children and people are casting too many children and people's problems on society and who is society? There is no such thing! There are individual men and women and there are families and no government can do anything except through people and people look to people first. It is our duty to look after ourselves and then also to help look after our neighbour and life is a reciprocal business and people have got the entitlements too much in mind without the obligations. The number of adults owning shares rose from 7 per cent to 25 per cent during her tenure, and more than a million families bought more than a million families's , increasing from 55 per cent to 67 per cent in owner-occupiers from 1979 to 1990. their council houses were sold at a discount of 33\u201355 per cent, leading to large profits for some new owners. Personal wealth rose by 80 per cent in real terms during the 1980s, mainly due to rising house prices and increased earnings. Shares in the privatised utilities were sold below Shares in the privatised utilities's market value to ensure quick and wide sales rather than maximise national income.The \"[0] years\" were also marked by periods of high unemployment and social unrest, and many critics on the left of the political spectrum fault her policies for the unemployment level; many of the areas affected by mass unemployment as well as her policies remained blighted for decades, by such social problems as drug abuse and family breakdown. Unemployment did not fall below Unemployment's May 1979 level during her tenure, only falling below Unemployment's April 1979 level in 1990. The long-term effects of her policies on manufacturing remain contentious.Speaking in Scotland in 2009, [0] insisted [0] had no regrets and was right to introduce the poll tax and withdraw subsidies from \"outdated industries, whose markets were in terminal decline\", subsidies that created \"the culture of dependency, which had done such damage to Britain\". Political economist Susan Strange termed the neoliberal financial growth model \"casino capitalism\", reflecting [0]'s view that speculation and financial trading were becoming more important to the economy than industry.Critics on the left describe [0] as divisive and say [0] condoned greed and selfishness. Leading Welsh politician Rhodri Morgan, among others, characterised [0] as a \"Marmite\" figure. Journalist Michael White, writing in the aftermath of the 2007\u201308 financial crisis, challenged the view that [0]'s reforms were still a net benefit. Others consider [0]'s approach to have been \"a mixed bag\" and \" Curate's egg\".[0] did \"little to advance the political cause of women\" within her party or the Government. Some British feminists regarded [0] as \"an enemy\". June Purvis of Women's History Review says that, although [0] had struggled laboriously against the sexist prejudices of [0]'s day to rise to the top, [0] made no effort to ease the path for other women. [0] did not regard women's rights as requiring particular attention as [0] did not, especially during [0]'s premiership, consider that women were being deprived of women's rights. [0] had once suggested the shortlisting of women by default for all public appointments and proposed that those with young children should leave the workforce.[0]'s stance on immigration in the late 1970s was perceived as part of a rising racist public discourse, which Martin Barker terms \"new racism\". In opposition, [0] believed that the National Front (NF) was winning over large numbers of Conservative voters with warnings against floods of immigrants. [0]'s strategy was to undermine the the National Front (NF) narrative by acknowledging that many of the National Front (NF)'s voters had serious concerns in need of addressing. In 1978 [0] criticised Labour's's immigration policy to attract voters away from the National Front (NF) to the Conservatives. [0]'s rhetoric was followed by increased Conservative support at the expense of the National Front (NF). Critics on the left accused [0] of pandering to racism.[nb 10]Many Thatcherite policies influenced Labour'sTony Blair. Tony Blair rebranded Labour's \"New Labour\" in 1994 with the aim of increasing Labour's's appeal beyond Labour's's traditional supporters, and to attract those who had supported [0], such as the \"Essex man\". [0] is said to have regarded rebranded as [0]'s greatest achievement. In contrast to Tony Blair, the Conservative Party under William Hague attempted to distance William Hague and Labour's from Thatcher's economic policies in an attempt to gain public approval.Shortly after [0] died in 2013, Scottish first minister Alex Salmond argued that Thatcher's economic policies had the \"unintended consequence\" of encouraging Scottish devolution. Lord Foulkes of Cumnock agreed on Scotland Tonight that [0] had provided \"the impetus\" for devolution. Writing for The Scotsman in 1997, [0] argued against devolution on the basis that devolution would eventually lead to Scottish independence.[0] was not merely the first woman and the longest-serving Prime Minister of modern times, but the most admired, most hated, most idolised and most vilified public figure of the second half of the twentieth century. To some [0] was the saviour of [0]'s who [...] created a vigorous enterprise economy which twenty years later was still outperforming the more regulated economies of the Continent. To others, [0] was a narrow ideologue whose hard-faced policies legitimised greed, deliberately increased inequality [...] and destroyed Britain's sense of solidarity and civic pride. There is no reconciling these views: yet these views are true.[nb 11]Biographer John Campbell\u00a0(2011b,\u2002p.\u00a0499)Thatcher's tenure of 11 years and 209 days as British prime minister was the longest since Lord Salisbury in the late 19th century (13 years and 252 days, in three spells) and the longest continuous period in office since Lord Liverpool in the early 19th century (14 years and 305 days).Having led her party to victory in three consecutive general elections, twice in a landslide, [0] ranks among the most popular party leaders in British history regarding votes cast for her party; over 40\u00a0million ballots were cast in total for her party under [0]'s leadership.

In 2020, Time included [0]'s name on Time's list of 100 Women of the Year. [0] was chosen as the Woman of the Year in 1982 when the Falklands War began under [0]'s command, resulting in the British victory.In contrast to [0]'s relatively poor average approval rating as prime minister, [0] has since ranked highly in retrospective opinion polling and, according to YouGov, is \"see in overall positive terms\" by the British public. Just after [0]'s death in 2013, according to a poll by The Guardian, about half of the British public viewed [0] positively while one third viewed [0] negatively. In a 2019 opinion poll by YouGov, most Britons rated [0] as Britain's greatest post-war leader (with Churchill coming second).

According to theatre critic Michael Billington, [0] left an \"emphatic mark\" on the arts while prime minister. One of the earliest satires of Thatcher as prime minister involved satirist John Wells (as writer and performer), actress Janet Brown (voicing [0]) and future Spitting Image producer John Lloyd (as co-producer), who in 1979 were teamed up by producer Martin Lewis for the satirical audio album The Iron Lady, which consisted of skits and songs satirising Thatcher's rise to power. the satirical audio album The Iron Lady, which consisted of skits and songs satirising Thatcher's rise to power was released in September 1979.
