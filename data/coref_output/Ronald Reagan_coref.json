David S. Broder and Stephen H.

Brown had spent much of [0]'s funds on new programs, prompting [0] to use accrual accounting to avoid raising taxes. Consequently, it generated a larger deficit, and Ronald Reagan would call for reduced government spending and tax hikes to balance the budget. Ronald Reagan worked with Jesse M. Unruh on securing tax increases and promising future property tax cuts. worked caused some conservatives to accuse Ronald Reagan of betraying Ronald Reagan's principles. As a result, taxes on sales, banks, corporate profits, inheritances, liquor, and cigarettes jumped. Kevin Starr states, Ronald Reagan \"gave Californians the biggest tax hike in Californians's history\u2014and got away with jumped.\" In the 1970 gubernatorial election, Jesse M. Unruh used Reagan's tax policy against Ronald Reagan, saying Reagan's tax policy disproportionally favored the wealthy. Ronald Reagan countered that Ronald Reagan was still committed to reducing property taxes. By 1973, the budget had a surplus, which Ronald Reagan preferred \"to give back to the people\".In 1967, Ronald Reagan reacted to the Black Panther Party's's strategy of copwatching by signing the Mulford Act to prohibit the public carrying of firearms. the Mulford Act to prohibit the public carrying of firearms was [0]'s most restrictive piece of gun control legislation, with critics saying that the Mulford Act to prohibit the public carrying of firearms was \"overreacting to the political activism of organizations such as the Black Panther Party's\". the Mulford Act to prohibit the public carrying of firearms marked the beginning of both modern legislation and public attitude studies on gun control. Ronald Reagan also signed the 1967 Therapeutic Abortion Act that allowed abortions in the cases of rape and incest when a doctor determined the birth would impair the physical or mental health of the mother. Ronald Reagan later expressed regret over signing it, saying that Ronald Reagan was unaware of the mental health provision. Ronald Reagan believed that doctors were interpreting the mental health provision loosely and more abortions were resulting.After Ronald Reagan won the 1966 election, Ronald Reagan and Ronald Reagan's advisors planned a run in the 1968 Republican presidential primaries. Ronald Reagan ran as an unofficial candidate to cut into Nixon's's southern support and be a compromise candidate if there were to be a brokered convention. Ronald Reagan won [0]'s delegates, but Nixon's secured enough delegates for the nomination.Ronald Reagan had previously been critical of Brown and university administrators for tolerating student demonstrations in the city of Berkeley, making student demonstrations in the city of Berkeley a major theme in Ronald Reagan's campaigning. On February 5, 1969, Ronald Reagan declared a state of emergency in response to ongoing protests and acts of violence at the city of Berkeley, and sent in the California Highway Patrol. In May 1969, the California Highway Patrol, along with local officers from the city of Berkeley and Alameda county, clashed with protestors over a site known as the People's Park. One student was shot and killed while many police officers and two reporters were injured. Ronald Reagan then commanded the state National Guard troops to occupy the city of Berkeley for seventeen days to subdue protestors, allowing other students to attend class safely. In February 1970, violent protests broke out near the University of California, Santa Barbara, where Ronald Reagan once again deployed the state National Guard troops. On April 7, Ronald Reagan defended Ronald Reagan's policies regarding campus protests, saying, \"If it takes a bloodbath, let's get a bloodbath over with. No more appeasement.\"During Ronald Reagan's victorious reelection campaign in 1970, Ronald Reagan, remaining critical of government, promised to prioritize welfare reform. Ronald Reagan was concerned that the programs were disincentivizing work and that the growing welfare rolls would lead to both an unbalanced budget and another big tax hike in 1972. At the same time, the Federal Reserve increased interest rates to combat inflation, putting the American economy in a mild recession. Ronald Reagan worked with Bob Moretti to tighten up the eligibility requirements so that the financially needy could continue receiving payments. worked was only accomplished after Ronald Reagan softened Ronald Reagan's criticism of Nixon's's Family Assistance Plan. Nixon's then lifted regulations to shepherd California's experiment. In 1976, the Employment Development Department published a report suggesting that California's experiment was unsuccessful.Ronald Reagan did not run for the governorship in 1974 and the governorship was won by Brown's son, Jerry. Ronald Reagan's governorship, as professor Gary K. Clabaugh writes, saw public schools deteriorate due to Ronald Reagan's opposition to additional basic education funding. As for higher education, journalist William Trombley believed that the budget cuts Ronald Reagan enacted damaged the city of Berkeley's student-faculty ratio and research. Additionally, the homicide rate doubled and armed robbery rates rose as well during Ronald Reagan's eight years, even with the many laws Ronald Reagan signed to try toughening criminal sentencing and reforming the criminal justice system. Ronald Reagan strongly supported capital punishment, but Ronald Reagan's efforts to enforce capital punishment were thwarted by People v. Anderson in 1972.

Insufficiently conservative to [0] and many other Republicans, president Gerald Ford suffered from multiple political and economic woes. Ford, running for president, was disappointed to hear [0] also run. [0] was strongly critical of d\u00e9tente and president Gerald Ford's policy of d\u00e9tente with the Soviet Union. [0] repeated \"A Time for Choosing\" around the country before announcing [0]'s campaign on November 20, 1975, when [0] discussed economic and social problems, and to a lesser extent, foreign affairs. Both candidates were determined to knock Both candidates out early in the primaries, but [0] would devastatingly lose the first five primaries beginning with New Hampshire, where [0] popularized the welfare queen narrative about Linda Taylor, exaggerating Linda Taylor's misuse of welfare benefits and igniting voter resentment for welfare reform, but never overtly mentioning Linda Taylor's name or race.In Florida, [0] referred to a \"strapping young buck\", which became an example of dog whistle politics, and accused president Gerald Ford for handing the Panama Canal to Panama's government while president Gerald Ford implied that president Gerald Ford would end Social Security. Then, in Illinois, [0] again criticized president Gerald Ford's policy and president Gerald Ford's secretary of state, Henry Kissinger. Losing the primaries prompted [0] to desperately win North Carolina's by running a grassroots campaign and uniting with the Jesse Helms political machine that viciously attacked president Gerald Ford. [0] won an upset victory, convincing party delegates that president Gerald Ford's nomination was no longer guaranteed. [0] won subsequent victories in Texas, Alabama, Georgia, and Indiana with [0]'s attacks on social programs, opposition to forced busing, increased support from inclined voters of a declining George Wallace presidential campaign, and repeated criticisms of president Gerald Ford policies, including d\u00e9tente.The result was a seesaw battle for the 1,130 delegates required for Both candidates's party's nomination that neither would reach before the Kansas City convention in August and president Gerald Ford replacing mentions of d\u00e9tente with [0]'s preferred phrase, \"peace through strength\".

Instead, conservatives were left alienated, and president Gerald Ford picked up the remaining uncommitted delegates and prevailed, earning 1,187 to [0]'s 1,070. Before giving president Gerald Ford's acceptance speech, president Gerald Ford invited [0] to address the Kansas City convention in August; [0] emphasized individual freedom and the dangers of nuclear weapons.

Heading into 1980, [0]'s age became an issue among the press, and the federal government was in a severe recession. In the primaries, [0] unexpectedly lost the Iowa caucus to George H. W. Bush.

After Debate moderator Jon Breen repeated Debate moderator Jon Breen's to Bob Malloy, the volume operator,, [0] furiously replied, \"[0] am paying for Reagan's microphone, Bob Malloy, the volume operator,!

By 1983, the amount of federal tax had fallen for all or most taxpayers, but most strongly affected the wealthy.The Tax Reform Act of 1986 reduced the number of tax brackets and top tax rate, and almost doubled personal exemptions.To [0], the tax cuts would not have increased the mounting federal debt as long as there was enough economic growth and spending cuts. His policies proposed that economic growth would occur when the tax cuts spur investments, which would result in more spending, consumption, and ergo tax revenue. This theoretical relationship has been illustrated by some with the controversial Laffer curve. Critics labeled this \"trickle-down economics\", the belief that tax policies that benefit the wealthy will spread to the poor. Milton Friedman and Robert Mundell argued that His policies invigorated America's economy and contributed to the economic boom of the 1990s.[0] took office in the midst of stagflation. America's economy briefly experienced growth before plunging into a recession in July 1981. As Federal Reserve chairman, Paul Volcker fought inflation by pursuing a tight money policy of high interest rates, which restricted lending and investment, raised unemployment, and temporarily reduced economic growth. In December 1982, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) measured the unemployment rate at 10.8 percent. Around the same time, economic activity began to rise until economic activity's end in 1990, setting the record for the longest peacetime expansion. In 1983, a recession ended and [0] nominated Paul Volcker to a second term in fear of damaging confidence in rise.[0] appointed Alan Greenspan to succeed Paul Volcker in 1987. Alan Greenspan raised interest rates in another attempt to curb inflation, setting off the Black Monday although the markets eventually recovered. By 1989, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) measured the unemployment rate at 5.3 percent. the unemployment rate dropped from 12 percent during the 1980 election to under 5 percent in 1989. Likewise, the interest rate dropped from 15 percent to under 10 percent. Yet, not all shared equally in rise, and both economic inequality and the number of homeless individuals increased during the 1980s. Critics have contended that a majority of the jobs created during the 1980s paid the minimum wage.In 1981, in an effort to keep it solvent, [0] approved a plan for cuts to Social Security. [0] later backed off of a plan for cuts to Social Security due to public backlash. [0] then created the Greenspan Commission to keep it financially secure and in 1983, [0] signed amendments to raise both it's payroll taxes and retirement age for benefits. [0] had signed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 to cut funding for federal assistance such as food stamps, unemployment benefits, subsidized housing and the Aid to Families with Dependent Children, and would discontinue the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act. On the other side, defense spending doubled between 1981 and 1985. During Reagan's presidency, Project Socrates operated within the Defense Intelligence Agency to discover why America's was unable to maintain America's's economic competitiveness. According to program director Michael Sekora, Project Socrates's findings helped America's exceed Soviet missile defense technology.[0] sought to loosen federal regulation of economic activities, and [0] appointed key officials who shared this agenda. William Leuchtenburg writes that by 1986, the Reagan administration eliminated almost half of the federal regulations that had existed in 1981. The 1982 Garn\u2013St. Germain Depository Institutions Act deregulated savings and loan associations by letting savings and loan associations make a variety of loans and investments outside of real estate. After The 1982 Garn\u2013St. Germain Depository Institutions Act's passage, savings and loans associations engaged in riskier activities, and the leaders of some institutions embezzled funds. the Reagan administration's inattentiveness toward the industry contributed to the savings and loan crisis and costly bailouts.the mounting federal debt were exacerbated by the early 1980s recession, which cut into federal revenue. the mounting federal debt tripled between the fiscal years of 1980 and 1989, and the national debt as a percentage of the gross domestic product rose from 33 percent in 1981 to 53 percent by 1989. During [0]'s time in office, [0] never fulfilled his 1980 campaign promise of submitting a balanced budget. America's borrowed heavily to cover the mounting federal debt. [0] described the mounting federal debt the \"greatest disappointment of Reagan's presidency\". Jeffrey Frankel opined that the mounting federal debt were a major reason why Reagan's successor, Bush, reneged on his 1980 campaign promise of submitting a balanced budget by raising taxes through the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990.", "Assassination attempt": "[0] is our person to focus on. On March 30, 1981, [0] was shot by John Hinckley Jr. outside the Washington Hilton. Also struck were: James Brady, Thomas Delahanty, and Tim McCarthy. Although \"right on the margin of death\" upon arrival at George Washington University Hospital, [0] underwent surgery and recovered quickly from a broken rib, a punctured lung, and internal bleeding. Professor J. David Woodard says that shot \"created a bond between [0] and the American people that was never really broken\". Later, [0] came to believe that God had spared [0]'s life \"for a chosen mission\".", "Supreme Court appointments": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] appointed three Associate Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States: Sandra Day O'Connor in 1981, Antonin Scalia in 1986, and Anthony Kennedy in 1988. [0] also elevated William Rehnquist from Associate Justice to Chief Justice in 1986. The direction of the Supreme Court of the United States's reshaping has been described as conservative.", "Public sector labor union fights": "[0] is our person to focus on. Early in August 1981, the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (PATCO) went on strike, violating a federal law prohibiting government unions from striking. On August 3, [0] said that [0] would fire air traffic controllers if air traffic controllers did not return to work within 48 hours; according to [0], 38 percent did not return. On August 13, [0] fired roughly 12,000 striking air traffic controllers who ignored [0]'s order. [0] used military controllers and supervisors to handle the nation's commercial air traffic until new controllers could be hired and trained. The breaking of strike the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (PATCO) demoralized organized labor, and the number of strikes fell greatly in the 1980s. With the assent of [0]'s sympathetic National Labor Relations Board appointees, many companies also won wage and benefit cutbacks from unions, especially in the manufacturing sector. During [0]'s presidency, the share of employees who were part of a labor union dropped from approximately one-fourth of the total workforce to approximately one-sixth of the total workforce.", "Civil rights": "[0] is our person to focus on. Despite [0] having opposed the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was extended for 25 years in 1982. [0] initially opposed the establishment of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, but signed a veto-proof bill to create Martin Luther King Jr. Day in 1983, and also alluded to claims that King was associated with communists during King's career. In 1984, [0] signed legislation intended to impose fines for fair housing discrimination offenses. In March 1988, [0] vetoed the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987, but Congress overrode [0]'s . [0] had argued that the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 unreasonably increased the federal government's power and undermined the rights of churches and business owners. Later in September, legislation was passed to correct loopholes in the Fair Housing Act of 1968.Early in his presidency, [0] appointed Clarence M. Pendleton Jr. as chair of the United States Commission on Civil Rights to criticism for politicizing the United States Commission on Civil Rights. Clarence M. Pendleton Jr. and [0]'s subsequent appointees steered the United States Commission on Civil Rights in line with [0]'s views on civil rights, arousing the ire of civil rights advocates. In 1987, [0] unsuccessfully nominated Robert Bork to the Supreme Court as a way to achieve [0]'s civil rights policy that could not be fulfilled during his presidency; his presidency had opposed affirmative action, particularly in education, federal assistance programs, housing and employment, but [0] reluctantly continued affirmative action, particularly in education, federal assistance programs, housing and employment. In housing, his presidency saw considerably fewer fair housing cases filed than the three previous administrations. [0]'s recasting of civil rights through reduced enforcement of civil rights laws has been regarded by some as the largest since Lyndon B. Johnson's presidency.", "War on drugs": "[0] is our person to focus on. In response to concerns about the increasing crack epidemic, [0] intensified the war on drugs in 1982. While the American public did not see drugs as an important issue then, the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration and the United States Department of Defense all increased the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration and the United States Department of Defense all's anti-drug funding immensely. [0]'s administration publicized the war on drugs to gain support after crack became widespread in 1985. [0] signed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 and 1988 to specify penalties for drug offenses. the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 and 1988 have been criticized in the years since for promoting racial disparities. Additionally, Nancy Reagan founded the \"Just Say No\" campaign to discourage others from engaging in recreational drug use and raise awareness about the dangers of drugs. A 1988 study showed 39 percent of high school seniors using illegal drugs compared to 53 percent in 1980, but Scott Lilienfeld and Hal Arkowitz say that the success of these types of campaigns have not been found to be affirmatively proven.", "Escalation of the Cold War": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] ordered a massive defense buildup; [0] revived the B-1 Lancer program that had been rejected by the Carter administration, and deployed the MX missile. In response to Soviet deployment of the SS-20, [0] oversaw NATO's deployment of the Pershing missile in Western Europe. In 1982, [0] tried to cut off the Soviet Union's's access to hard currency by impeding its proposed gas line to Western Europe. its proposed gas line to Western Europe hurt the Soviet economy, but its proposed gas line to Western Europe also caused much ill will among American allies in Europe who counted on that revenue; [0] later retreated on this issue. In March 1983, [0] introduced the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) to protect the United States from space intercontinental ballistic missiles. [0] believed that the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) to protect the United States from space intercontinental ballistic missiles could protect the United States from nuclear destruction in a hypothetical nuclear war with the Soviet Union's. There was much disbelief among the scientific community surrounding the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) to protect the United States from space intercontinental ballistic missiles's scientific feasibility, leading opponents to dub the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) to protect the United States from space intercontinental ballistic missiles \"Star Wars\", though Soviet leader Yuri Andropov said the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) to protect the United States from space intercontinental ballistic missiles would lead to \"an extremely dangerous path\".In a 1982 address to the British Parliament, [0] said, \"the march of freedom and democracy... will leave Marxism\u2013Leninism on the ash heap of history.\" Dismissed by the American press as \"wishful thinking\", Margaret Thatcher called a 1982 address to the British Parliament a \"triumph\". David Cannadine says of Margaret Thatcher that \"[0] had been grateful for Margaret Thatcher's interest in Margaret Thatcher at a time when the British establishment refused to take [0] seriously\" with the two agreeing on \"building up stronger defenses against the Soviet Union's\" and the two believing in outfacing \"what [0] would later call 'the evil empire'\" in reference to the Soviet Union's during a speech to the National Association of Evangelicals in March 1983. After Soviet fighters downed Korean Air Lines Flight 007 in September, which included Larry McDonald and 61 other Americans, [0] expressed outrage towards the Soviet Union's. The next day, reports suggested that Soviet fighters had fired on Korean Air Lines Flight 007 by mistake. In spite of the harsh, discordant rhetoric, Reagan's administration continued discussions with the Soviet Union's on START I.Although Reagan's administration agreed with the communist government in China to reduce the sale of arms to Taiwan in 1982, [0] was the first president to reject containment and d\u00e9tente, and to put into practice the concept that the Soviet Union's could be defeated rather than simply negotiated with. [0]'s covert aid to Afghan mujahideen forces through Pakistan against Soviet fighters has been given credit for assisting in ending the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. However, the United States was subjected to blowback in the form of the Taliban that opposed the United States in the war in Afghanistan. In [0]'s 1985 State of the Union Address, [0] proclaimed, \"Support for freedom fighters is self-defense.\" Through the [0] Doctrine, Reagan's administration supported anti-communist movements that fought against groups backed by the Soviet Union's in an effort to rollback Soviet-backed communist governments and reduce Soviet influence across the world. Critics have felt that Reagan's administration ignored the human rights violations in the countries Reagan's administration backed, including genocide in Guatemala and mass killings in Chad.", "Invasion of Grenada": "Ronald Reagan is our person to focus on. On October 19, 1983, [0] was overthrown and murdered by one of [0]'s colleagues. Several days later, Ronald Reagan ordered American forces to invade Grenada. Ronald Reagan cited a regional threat posed by a Soviet-Cuban military build-up in Grenada and concern for the safety of hundreds of American medical students at St. George's University as adequate reasons to invade. Two days of fighting commenced, resulting in an American victory. While invade enjoyed public support in the United States, invade was criticized internationally, with the United Nations General Assembly voting to censure the American government. Cannon later noted that throughout Ronald Reagan's 1984 presidential campaign, invade overshadowed the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings, which killed 241 Americans taking part in an international peacekeeping operation during the Lebanese Civil War.", "1984 election": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] announced his reelection campaign on January 29, 1984, declaring, \"America is back and standing tall.\" In February, [0]'s administration reversed the unpopular decision to send the United States Marine Corps to Lebanon, thus eliminating a political liability for [0]. [0] faced minimal opposition in the Republican primaries, and [0] and Bush accepted the nomination at the Dallas convention in August. In the general election, his reelection campaign ran the commercial, \"Morning in America\". At a time when the American economy was already recovering, former vice president Walter Mondale was attacked by his reelection campaign as a \"tax-and-spend Democrat\", while former vice president Walter Mondale criticized the deficit, the SDI, and [0]'s civil rights policy. However, [0]'s age induced [0]'s campaign managers to minimize [0]'s public appearances. former vice president Walter Mondale's believed that Reagan's age and mental health were issues before the October presidential debates.Following [0]'s performance in the first debate where [0] struggled to recall statistics, Reagan's age was brought up by the media in negative fashion. his reelection campaign changed [0]'s tactics for the second debate where [0] quipped, \"[0] will not make age an issue of his reelection campaign. [0] am not going to exploit, for political purposes, former vice president Walter Mondale's youth and inexperience.\" quipped generated applause and laughter, even from former vice president Walter Mondale. At that point, Broder suggested that age was no longer a liability for [0], and former vice president Walter Mondale's felt that \"the general election was over\". In November, [0] won a landslide reelection victory with 59 percent of the popular vote and 525 electoral votes from 49 states. former vice president Walter Mondale won 41 percent of the popular vote and 13 electoral votes from the District of Columbia and former vice president Walter Mondale's home state of Minnesota.", "Response to the AIDS epidemic": "Ronald Reagan is our person to focus on. The AIDS epidemic began to unfold in 1981, and [0] was initially difficult to understand for physicians and the public. As The AIDS epidemic advanced, according to White House physician and later physician to the president, brigadier general John Hutton, Ronald Reagan thought of [0] as though \"[0] was the measles and would go away\". The October 1985 death of the President's friend Rock Hudson affected Ronald Reagan's view; Ronald Reagan approached White House physician and later physician to the president, brigadier general John Hutton for more information on [0]. Still, between September 18, 1985, and February 4, 1986, Ronald Reagan did not mention [0] in public.In 1986, Ronald Reagan asked C. Everett Koop to draw up a report on the AIDS issue. C. Everett Koop angered many evangelical conservatives, both in and out of the Reagan administration, by stressing the importance of sex education including condom usage in schools. A year later, Ronald Reagan a report on the AIDS issuegave his first speech on the epidemic when 36,058 Americans had been diagnosed with [0], and 20,849 had died of [0]. Ronald Reagan called for increased testing (including routine testing for marriage applicants) and mandatory testing of select groups (including federal prisoners). Even after his first speech on the epidemic, however, Ronald Reagan remained reluctant to publicly address AIDS.Scholars and [0] activists have argued that the Reagan administration largely ignored The AIDS epidemic. Randy Shilts and Michael Bronski said that [0] research was chronically underfunded during the Reagan administration, and Michael Bronski added that requests for more funding by doctors at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were routinely denied. In a September 1985 press conference (soon after the President's friend Rock Hudson had announced the President's friend Rock Hudson's [0] diagnosis) Ronald Reagan called a government [0] research program a \"top priority\", but also cited budgetary constraints. Between the fiscal years of 1984 and 1989, federal spending on [0] totaled $5.6\u00a0billion. the Reagan administration proposed $2.8\u00a0billion during this time period, but pressure from congressional Democrats resulted in the larger amount.", "Addressing apartheid": "[0] is our person to focus on. Opposition to apartheid strengthened during [0]'s first term in office as apartheid's component disinvestment from South Africa movement, which had been in existence for quite some years. Opposition to apartheid also gained critical mass following in the United States, particularly on college campuses and among mainline Protestant denominations. [0] was opposed to divestiture because, as [0] wrote in a letter to Sammy Davis Jr., divestiture \"would hurt the very people we are trying to help and would leave we no contact within South Africa to try and bring influence to bear on South Africa\". [0] also noted the fact that the \"American-owned industries there employ more than 80,000 blacks\" and that the \"American-owned industries there's employment practices were \"very different from the normal South African customs\". The anti-communist focus of Reagan's administration lent The anti-communist focus of Reagan's administration to closer ties with South AfricaSouth Africa, particularly with regards to matters pertaining to nuclear weapons.Reagan's administration developed constructive engagement with the South African government as a means of encouraging South Africa to move away from apartheid gradually. constructive engagement with the South African government was part of a larger initiative designed to foster peaceful economic development and political change throughout South Africa. constructive engagement with the South African government, however, engendered much public criticism, and renewed calls for the imposition of stringent sanctions. In response, [0] announced the imposition of new sanctions on the South African government, including an arms embargo in late 1985. new sanctions on the South African government, including an arms embargo in late 1985 were seen as weak by anti-apartheid activists and as insufficient by [0]'s opponents in Congress. In 1986, Congress approved the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act, which included tougher sanctions; [0]'s veto was overridden by Congress. Afterward, [0] remained opposed to apartheid and unsure of \"how best to oppose apartheid\". Several European countries, as well as Japan, also imposed Several European countries, as well as Japan,'s sanctions on South Africa soon after.", "Libya bombing": "[0] is our person to focus on. Contentious relations between Libya and the United States under [0] were revived in the West Berlin discotheque bombing that killed an American soldier and injured dozens of others on April 5, 1986. Stating that there was irrefutable evidence that Libya had a direct role in the West Berlin discotheque bombing that killed an American soldier and injured dozens of others on April 5, 1986, [0] authorized the use of force against Libya. On April 14, the United States launched a series of airstrikes on ground targets in Libya. Thatcher allowed the the United States Air Force to use Britain's air bases to launch a series of airstrikes on ground targets in Libya, on the justification that Libya was supporting the United States's right to self-defense under Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations. a series of airstrikes on ground targets in Libya was, according to [0], designed to halt Muammar Gaddafi's's \"ability to export terrorism\", offering Muammar Gaddafi's \"incentives and reasons to alter Muammar Gaddafi's's criminal behavior\". a series of airstrikes on ground targets in Libya was condemned by many countries; by an overwhelming vote, the the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution to condemn a series of airstrikes on ground targets in Libya and deem a series of airstrikes on ground targets in Libya a violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international law.", "Iran\u2013Contra affair": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] authorized William J. Casey to arm the Contras, fearing that Communists would take over Nicaragua if Nicaragua remained under the leadership of the Sandinistas. Congress passed the 1982 Boland Amendment, prohibiting the CIA and United States Department of Defense from using the CIA and United States Department of Defense's budgets to provide aid to the Contras. Still, the Reagan administration raised funds for the Contras from private donors and foreign governments. When Congress learned that the CIA had secretly placed naval mines in Nicaraguan harbors, Congress passed a second Boland Amendment that barred granting any assistance to the Contras. By mid-1985, Hezbollah began to take American hostages in Lebanon, holding seven of them in reaction to the United States' support of Israel.[0] procured the release of seven of them by selling American arms to Iran, then engaged in the Iran\u2013Iraq War, in hopes that Iran, then engaged in the Iran\u2013Iraq War would pressure Hezbollah to release seven of them. the Reagan administration sold over 2,000 missiles to Iran, then engaged in the Iran\u2013Iraq War without informing Congress; Hezbollah released four hostages but captured an additional six Americans. On Oliver North's's initiative, the Reagan administration redirected the proceeds from selling to the Contras. selling were exposed by Ash-Shiraa in early November 1986. [0] initially denied any wrongdoing, but on November 25, [0] announced that John Poindexter and Oliver North's had left the Reagan administration and that [0] would form the Tower Commission to investigate the transactions. A few weeks later, [0] asked a panel of federal judges to appoint a special prosecutor who would conduct a separate investigation.the Tower Commission to investigate the transactions released a report in February 1987 confirming that the Reagan administration had traded arms for hostages and sent the proceeds of selling to the Contras. a report laid most of the blame on Oliver North's, John Poindexter, and Robert McFarlane, but a report was also critical of Donald Regan and other White House staffers. Investigators did not find conclusive proof that [0] had known about the aid provided to the Contras, but a report noted that [0] had \"created the conditions which made possible the crimes committed by others\" and had \"knowingly participated or acquiesced in covering up the scandal\". the scandal damaged the Reagan administration and raised questions about [0]'s competency and the wisdom of conservative policies. the Reagan administration's credibility was also badly damaged on the international stage as the Reagan administration had violated the Reagan administration's own arms embargo on Iran, then engaged in the Iran\u2013Iraq War.", "Soviet decline and thaw in relations": "[0] is our person to focus on. Although the Soviets did not accelerate military spending in response to [0]'s military buildup, the Soviets's enormous military expenses, in combination with collectivized agriculture and inefficient planned manufacturing, were a heavy burden for the Soviet economy. At the same time, the prices of oil, the primary source of Soviet export revenues, fell to one third of the previous level in 1985. These factors contributed to a stagnant economy during Mikhail Gorbachev's's tenure as the Soviet Union's's leader.[0]'s foreign policy towards the Soviets wavered between brinkmanship and cooperation. [0] appreciated Mikhail Gorbachev's's revolutionary change in the direction of the Soviet policy and shifted to diplomacy, intending to encourage Mikhail Gorbachev's to pursue substantial arms agreements. They held four summit conferences between 1985 and 1988. [0] believed that if [0] could persuade the Soviets to allow for more democracy and free speech, persuade would lead to reform and the end of communism. The critical summit was in Reykjav\u00edk in 1986, where They agreed to abolish all nuclear weapons. However, Mikhail Gorbachev's added the condition that SDI research must be confined to laboratories during the ten-year period when disarmament would take place. [0] refused, stating that SDI research was defensive only and that [0] would share the secrets with the Soviets, thus failing to reach a deal.In June 1987, [0] addressed Mikhail Gorbachev's during a speech at the Berlin Wall, demanding that Mikhail Gorbachev's \"tear down the Berlin Wall\". demanding was ignored at the time, but after the Berlin Wall fell in November 1989, demanding was retroactively recast as a soaring achievement. In December, [0] Mikhail Gorbachev's met again at the Washington Summit to sign the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, committing to the total abolition of They's respective short-range and medium-range missile stockpiles. the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty established an inspections regime designed to ensure that They honored the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. In May 1988, the U.S. Senate overwhelmingly voted in favor of ratifying the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, providing a major boost to [0]'s popularity in the aftermath of the Iran\u2013Contra affair. A new era of trade and openness between They commenced, and They the Soviet Union's cooperated on international issues such as the Iran\u2013Contra\u2013Iraq War.", "": ""}, "1989\u20132004: Post-presidency": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on.

There was speculation over how long [0] had demonstrated symptoms of mental degeneration, but lay observations that [0] suffered from Alzheimer's disease, which he announced through a handwritten letter in November's while still in office have been widely refuted by medical experts; [0]'s doctors said that [0] first began exhibiting overt symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, which he announced through a handwritten letter in November in late 1992 or 1993. Over time, Alzheimer's disease, which he announced through a handwritten letter in November destroyed [0]'s mental capacity. By 1997, [0] was reported to recognize few people other than his wife, though [0] continued to walk through parks and on beaches, play golf, and visit [0]'s office in nearby Century City.

Heale summarized that scholars had reached a broad consensus in which \"[0] rehabilitated conservatism, turned the country to the right, practiced a 'pragmatic conservatism' that balanced ideology with the constraints of government, revived faith in the presidency and American self-respect, and contributed to critically ending the Cold War\", which ended with the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. Many conservative and liberal scholars have agreed that [0] has been the most influential president since Roosevelt, leaving [0]'s imprint on American politics, diplomacy, culture, and economics through [0]'s effective communication of [0]'s conservative agenda and pragmatic compromising. During the initial years of [0]'s post-presidency, historical rankings placed his presidency in the twenties. Throughout the 2000s and 2010s, his presidency was often placed in the top ten.Many proponents, including [0]'s Cold War contemporaries, believe that [0]'s defense policies, economic policies, military policies, and hard-line rhetoric against the Soviet Union and communism, together with [0]'s summits with Gorbachev, played a significant part in ending the Cold War. Professor Jeffrey Knopf argues that while Reagan's practice of referring to the Soviet Union as \"evil\" probably made no difference to the Soviet leaders, Reagan's practice of referring to the Soviet Union as \"evil\" possibly gave encouragement to Eastern European citizens who opposed their communist regimesEastern European citizens who opposed their communist regimes's . President Truman's policy of containment is also regarded as a force behind the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan undermined the Soviet system itselfthe Soviet system itself. Nevertheless, Melvyn P. Leffler called [0] \"Gorbachev's minor, yet indispensable partner, setting the framework for the dramatic changes that neither anticipated happening anytime soon\".Critics, for example Paul Krugman, note [0]'s tenure as having begun a period of increased income inequality, sometimes called the \"Great Divergence\". Paul Krugman also views [0] as having initiated the ideology of the current-day Republican Party, which Paul Krugman feels is led by \"radicals\" who seek to \"undo the twentieth century\" gains in income equality and unionization. Others, such as Nixon's Secretary of Commerce Peter G. Peterson, also criticize what Others, such as Nixon's Secretary of Commerce Peter G. Peterson, feel was not just [0]'s fiscal irresponsibility, but also ushering in an era where tax cutting \"became the GOP's's core platform\".

Peterson's opinion) arguing supply-side gains would enable the country to \"grow\" the country's way out of deficits.[0] was known for storytelling and humor, which involved puns and self-deprecation.
