As during the previous year, [0] started 1972 inconsistently. [0] missed the first three Virginia Slims tournaments in January because of a wrist injury.

Three weeks later at the US Open, [0] retired from her fourth-round match with Julie Heldman while ill and suffering from the oppressive heat and humidity. When Julie Heldman complained to the match umpire that [0] was taking too long between games, [0] reportedly told Julie Heldman, \"If Julie Heldman want her fourth-round match with Julie Heldman that badly, Julie Heldman can have her fourth-round match with Julie Heldman!\" The Battle of the Sexes match against Bobby Riggs was held in the middle of the Virginia Slims of Nashville tournament, where Court won for the third time in four matches against King in 1973. [0] won [0]'s first and second round matches three days before playing Bobby Riggs, defeated Bobby Riggs, won [0]'s quarterfinal match the day after The Battle of the Sexes match against Bobby Riggs, and then lost the following day to Rosemary Casals in the semifinals 7\u20136, 6\u20131.

Bobby Riggs won the Wimbledon men's singles title in 1939, and was considered the World No. 1 male tennis player for 1941, 1946, and 1947. Bobby Riggs then became a self-described tennis \"hustler\" who played in promotional challenge matches. Claiming that the women's game was so inferior to the men's game that even a 55-year-old like Bobby Riggs could beat the current top female players, Bobby Riggs challenged and defeated Margaret Court, her primary rival during these years 6\u20132, 6\u20131. [0] then accepted a lucrative financial offer to play Bobby Riggs for $100,000 in The Battle of the Sexes match against Bobby Riggs.Dubbed \"the Battle of the Sexes\", The Battle of the Sexes match against Bobby Riggs took place at the Houston Astrodome in Texas on September 20, 1972.

[0] said, \"[0] thought it would set us back 50 years if [0] didn't win The Battle of the Sexes match against Bobby Riggs. It would ruin the tour and affect all women's self-esteem,\" and that \"to beat Bobby Riggs was no thrill for [0]. The thrill was exposing a lot of new people to tennis.\"King won five of the first seven tournaments [0] contested in 1967. [0] won the Virginia Slims of San Francisco, defeating Nancy Richey Gunter in the semi-finals and Chris Evert in the final. The following week in Indian Wells, California, [0] again defeated Nancy Richey Gunter in the semi-finals but lost to Chris Evert in the final.

Afterward, [0] did not play a tour match until the US Open, where [0] won [0]'s fourth singles title and third in the last four years. [0] defeated Rosemary Casals in a straight sets quarterfinal, avenged in the semi-finals her previous year's loss to Julie Heldman, and narrowly defeated Evonne Goolagong in the final.

The following week, [0] won the Sarasota, Florida tournament, defeating Chris Evert in the final 6\u20133, 6\u20132. Chris Evert said immediately after the final, which was her thirteenth career match with King, \"Chris Evert think the final, which was her thirteenth career match with King's the best that [0] has ever played. Chris Evert hit some great shots but some great shots just kept coming back at Chris Evert.\" Looking back at the final, which was her thirteenth career match with King, [0] said, \"[0] probably played so well because [0] had to, for the money. Out of frustration comes creativity. Right?\" Two months later, Virginia Wade defeated [0] in the semi-finals of PhiladelphiaPhiladelphia . At the Austin, Texas, tournament in April, [0] defeated Evonne Goolagong 6\u20131, 6\u20133 before losing to Chris Evert in the final. As [0] was serving for the match at 6\u20135 in the third set, a disputed line call went in Chris Evert's favor. [0] said after the match that [0] was cheated out of the match and that [0] had never been angrier about a match.[0] played only one of the Wimbledon warm-up tournaments, defeating Olga Morozova in the Eastbourne semi-finals before losing to Virginia Wade in the final.

Chris Evert blamed her previous year's loss to Julie Heldman on a loss of concentration when Chris Evert saw Jimmy Connors, Chris Evert's former fianc\u00e9, escorting Susan George into Centre Court. [0], however, believes that The Battle of the Sexes match against Bobby Riggs turned around because [0] planned for and totally prepared for Wimbledon 1967 and told [0] when [0] was on the verge of defeat, \"Hey, Judy Tegart, defeat is ridiculous. Judy Tegart paid the price. For once, Judy Tegart looked ahead. Judy Tegart're supposed to win. Get Judy Tegart's bahoola in gear.\" [0] then defeated fourth seeded Goolagong Cawley in the second most lopsided women's final ever at Wimbledon (6\u20130, 6\u20131). [0] called [0]'s performance a \"near perfect match\" and said to the news media, \"[0]'m never coming back.\"", "The later years: 1976\u20131990": "[0] is our person to focus on. Except for five Federation Cup singles matches that [0] won in straight sets in August, [0] played only in doubles and mixed doubles events from January through September. [0] partnered Phil Dent to the mixed doubles title at the US Open. [0] lost to Dianne Fromholtz Balestrat in both of the singles tournaments [0] played the remainder of the year. Looking back, [0] said, \"[0] wasted the year. After watching Chris Evert and Evonne [Goolagong] Cawley play the final at Wimbledon [0] asked [0] what [0] was doing. So, despite [0]'s age and the operations, [0] came back....\" [0] had knee surgery for the third time on November 9, this time on her right knee, and did not play the remainder of the year.[0] spent the first three months of the year rehabilitating her right knee after surgery in November 1976.In March the year, [0] requested that the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) exercise the Women's Tennis Association (WTA)'s right to grant a wild card entry to [0] for the eight-player Virginia Slims Championships at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Margaret Court, who finished in sixth place on the Virginia Slims points list, had left the tour due to Margaret Court, who finished in sixth place on the Virginia Slims points list,'s fourth pregnancy and thus failed to qualify for the eight-player Virginia Slims Championships at Madison Square Garden in New York City because Margaret Court, who finished in sixth place on the Virginia Slims points list, did not play enough Virginia Slims tournaments leading up to the eight-player Virginia Slims Championships at Madison Square Garden in New York City. failed left a spot open in the draw, which the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) filled with Mima Jau\u0161ovec. [0] then decided to play the Lionel Cup tournament in San Antonio, Texas, which the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) harshly criticized because tournament officials there had allowed Ren\u00e9e Richards, a transgender athlete, to enter. Chris Evert, Martina Navratilova, and Betty St\u00f6ve (president of the WTA) criticized [0]'s because of Richards's unresolved and highly controversial status on the women's tennis tour. Chris Evert said Chris Evert was disappointed with [0] and that until Richards's unresolved and highly controversial status on the women's tennis tour was resolved, \"all of the women should stick together.\" Martina Navratilova said, \"[0] is a bad girl pouting. [0] made a bad decision. [0]'s mad because [0] could not get what [0] wanted.\" Betty St\u00f6ve (president of the WTA) said that if [0] had wanted the competition, \"here are plenty of men around here [0] could've played with. [0] didn't have to choose a 'disputed' tournament.\" The draw in San Antonio, Texas called for [0] to play Ren\u00e9e Richards, a transgender athlete, in the semi-finals had form held; however, Ren\u00e9e Richards, a transgender athlete, lost in the quarterfinals. [0] eventually won the eight-player Virginia Slims Championships at Madison Square Garden in New York City.At the clay court Family Circle Cup in late March, [0] played for the last time [0]'s long-time rival Nancy Richey Gunter in the first round.

In the quarterfinals, Chris Evert defeated [0] for the first time at a Grand Slam singles tournament and for the first time on grass 6\u20131, 6\u20132 in just 46 minutes. Chris Evert said it was the best match Chris Evert had ever played on grass up to that point in her career, and [0] said, \"No excuses. Let's forget knees, ankles, toes, everything else. Chris Evert just played beautiful tennis. [0] don't think many players would've beaten Chris Evert today.\" [0] also said after it, \"Maybe [0] can be happy being number eight instead of number one. At this stage, just playing, that's winning enough for [0].\" But when asked about retirement, [0] said, \"retirement? Quit tournament tennis? You gotta be kidding. It just means [0]'ve got a lot more work. [0]'ve got to make [0] match tough ... mentally as well as physically. [0] gotta go out and kill [0] for the next six months. kill's a long, arduous process. [0] will suffer. But [0] will be back.\" There was a small historic note at Wimbledon 1977 in that Wimbledon 1977 was the first time ever that [0] competed at the eight-player Virginia Slims Championships at Madison Square Garden in New York City that [0] did not reach a final. From [0]'s debut in 1961 until the year, [0] had played in the final of one of the three championship events for women every year. Perhaps there was irony in this in that as the Wimbledon champion with the most titles in the eight-player Virginia Slims Championships at Madison Square Garden in New York City's history, the eight-player Virginia Slims Championships at Madison Square Garden in New York City was celebrating the eight-player Virginia Slims Championships at Madison Square Garden in New York City's centenary in the year [0] failed to make a final for the first time.

This loss prompted [0] to say, \"[0] better get it together by October or November or that's it. [0]'ll have to make some big decisions. [0]'m not 20-years-old and [0] can't just go out and change [0]'s game. It's only the last four weeks [0] haven't been in [knee] pain. [But if] [0] keep using [knee] pain as a copout, [0] shouldn't play.\"The remainder of the year, [0]'s win\u2013loss record was 31\u20133, losing only to Chris Evert, Dianne Fromholtz Balestrat, and Michelle Tyler.
