George Harrison[nb 1] MBE (25 February 1943\u00a0\u2013 29 November 2001)[nb 2] was an English musician, singer and songwriter who achieved international fame as the lead guitarist of the Beatles. Sometimes called \"the quiet Beatle\", [0] embraced Indian culture and helped broaden the scope of popular music through [0]'s incorporation of Indian instrumentation and Hindu-aligned spirituality in the Beatles's work. Although the majority of the Beatles's songs were written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, most the Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two [0] compositions. [0]'s songs for the Beatles include \"Taxman\", \"Within You Without You\", \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\", \"Here Comes the Sun\" and \"Something\". [0]'s earliest musical influences included George Formby and Django Reinhardt; subsequent influences were Carl Perkins, Chet Atkins and Chuck Berry.By 1965, [0] had begun to lead the Beatles into folk rock through [0]'s interest in Bob Dylan and the Byrds, and towards Indian classical music through [0]'s use of Indian instruments, such as the sitar, which [0] had become acquainted with on the set of the film Help! [0] played sitar on numerous the Beatles songs, starting with \"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)\". Having initiated the Beatles's embrace of Transcendental Meditation in 1967, [0] subsequently developed an association with the Hare Krishna movement. After the Beatles's break-up in 1970, [0] released the triple album All Things Must Pass, a critically acclaimed work that produced [0]'s most successful hit single, \"My Sweet Lord\", and introduced [0]'s signature sound as a solo artist, the slide guitar. [0] also organised the 1971 Concert for Bangladesh with Indian musician Ravi Shankar, a precursor to later benefit concerts such as Live Aid. In [0]'s role as a music and film producer, [0] produced acts signed to the Beatles's Apple record label before founding Dark Horse Records in 1974. [0] co-founded HandMade Films in 1978, initially to produce the Monty Python troupe's comedy film The Life of Brian (1979).Harrison released several best-selling singles and albums as a solo performer. In 1988, [0] co-founded the platinum-selling supergroup the Traveling Wilburys. A prolific recording artist, [0] was featured as a guest guitarist on tracks by Badfinger, Ronnie Wood, and Billy Preston, and collaborated on songs and music with Dylan, Eric Clapton, Ringo Starr, and Tom Petty. Rolling Stone magazine ranked [0] number 31 in Rolling Stone magazine's 2023 list of greatest guitarists of all time.

In the following year [0] married Olivia Arias, with whom [0] had a son, Dhani. [0] died of lung cancer in 2001 at the age of 58, two years after surviving a knife attack by an intruder at [0]'s home, Friar Park. [0]'s remains were cremated, and the ashes were scattered according to Hindu tradition in a private ceremony in the Ganges and Yamuna rivers in India.

[0] was born at 12 Arnold Grove in Wavertree, Liverpool, on 25 February 1943.[nb 2] [0] was the youngest of four children of Harold Hargreaves (or Hargrove) Harrison (1909\u20131978) and Louise (n\u00e9e French; 1911\u20131970). Harold Hargreaves (or Hargrove) Harrison (1909\u20131978) was a bus conductor who had worked as a ship's steward on the White Star Line, and Louise (n\u00e9e French; 1911\u20131970) was a shop assistant of Irish Catholic descent. [0] had one sister, Louise (16 August 1931 \u2013 29 January 2023), and two brothers, Harold (born 1934) and Peter (20 July 1940 \u2013 1 June 2007).According to Boyd, Louise (n\u00e9e French; 1911\u20131970) was particularly supportive: \"All Louise (n\u00e9e French; 1911\u20131970) wanted for Louise (n\u00e9e French; 1911\u20131970)'s is that her children should be happy, and Louise (n\u00e9e French; 1911\u20131970) recognised that nothing made [0] quite as happy as making music.\" Louise (n\u00e9e French; 1911\u20131970) was an enthusiastic music fan, and Louise (n\u00e9e French; 1911\u20131970) was known among friends for Louise (n\u00e9e French; 1911\u20131970)'s loud singing voice, which at times startled visitors by rattling the Harrisons''s windows. When Louise (n\u00e9e French; 1911\u20131970) was pregnant with [0], Louise (n\u00e9e French; 1911\u20131970) often listened to the weekly broadcast Radio India. [0]'s biographer Joshua Greene wrote, \"Every Sunday Louise (n\u00e9e French; 1911\u20131970) tuned in to mystical sounds evoked by sitars and tablas, hoping that mystical sounds evoked by sitars and tablas would bring peace and calm to the baby in the womb.\"For the first four years of [0]'s life, [0] lived at 12 Arnold Grove in Wavertree, Liverpool,. 12 Arnold Grove in Wavertree, Liverpool, had an outdoor toilet and 12 Arnold Grove in Wavertree, Liverpool,'s only heat came from a single coal fire. In 1949, the Harrisons' was offered a council house and moved to 25 Upton Green, Speke. In 1948, at the age of five, [0] enrolled at Dovedale Primary School. [0] passed the eleven-plus exam and attended Liverpool Institute High School for Boys from 1954 to 1959. Though Liverpool Institute High School for Boys did offer a music course, [0] was disappointed with the absence of guitars, and felt Liverpool Institute High School for Boys \"moulded [students] into being frightened\".[0]'s earliest musical influences included George Formby, Cab Calloway, Django Reinhardt and Hoagy Carmichael; by the 1950s, Carl Perkins and Lonnie Donegan were significant influences. In early 1956, [0] had an epiphany: while riding [0]'s bicycle, [0] heard Elvis Presley's \"Heartbreak Hotel\" playing from a nearby house, and Elvis Presley's \"Heartbreak Hotel\" piqued [0]'s interest in rock and roll. [0] often sat at the back of the class drawing guitars in [0]'s schoolbooks, and later commented, \"[0] was totally into guitars.\" [0] cited Slim Whitman as another early influence: \"The first person [0] ever saw playing a guitar was Slim Whitman, either a photo of Slim Whitman in a magazine or live on television. Guitars were definitely coming in.\"At first, Harold Hargreaves (or Hargrove) Harrison (1909\u20131978) was apprehensive about Harold Hargreaves (or Hargrove) Harrison (1909\u20131978)'s interest in pursuing a music career. However, in 1956, Harold Hargreaves (or Hargrove) Harrison (1909\u20131978) bought [0] a Dutch Egmond flat-top acoustic guitar, which according to Harold Hargreaves (or Hargrove) Harrison (1909\u20131978), cost \u00a33.10s.\u2013 (equivalent to \u00a390 in 2023). One of Harold Hargreaves (or Hargrove) Harrison (1909\u20131978)'s friends taught [0] how to play \"Whispering\", \"Sweet Sue\" and \"Dinah\". Inspired by Lonnie Donegan's music, [0] formed a skiffle group, the Rebels, with [0]'s brother Peter and a friend, Arthur Kelly. On the bus to school, [0] met Paul McCartney, who also attended Liverpool Institute High School for Boys, and the pair bonded over the pair's shared love of music."}, "The Beatles: 1958\u20131970": {"": "George Harrison is our person to focus on. [0] and his friend John Lennon were in a skiffle group called the Quarrymen. In March 1958, at [0]'s urging, George Harrison auditioned for a skiffle group called the Quarrymen at Rory Storm's Morgue Skiffle Club, playing Arthur \"Guitar Boogie\" Smith's \"Guitar Boogie Shuffle\", but his friend John Lennon felt that George Harrison, having just turned 15, was too young to join a skiffle group called the Quarrymen. [0] arranged a second meeting, on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus, during which George Harrison impressed his friend John Lennon by performing the lead guitar part for the instrumental \"Raunchy\". George Harrison began socialising with a skiffle group called the Quarrymen, filling in on guitar as needed, and then became accepted as a member. Although George Harrison's father wanted George Harrison to continue George Harrison's education, George Harrison left school at 16 and worked for several months as an apprentice electrician at Blacklers, a local department store. During a skiffle group called the Quarrymen's first tour of Scotland, in 1960, George Harrison used the pseudonym \"Carl Harrison\", in reference to Carl Perkins.In 1960, promoter Allan Williams arranged for a skiffle group called the Quarrymena skiffle group called the Quarrymen , to play at the Indra and Kaiserkeller clubs in Hamburg, both owned by Bruno Koschmider. a skiffle group called the Quarrymen's first residency in Hamburg ended prematurely when George Harrison was deported for being too young to work in nightclubs. When Brian Epstein became a skiffle group called the Quarrymen's manager in December 1961, Brian Epstein polished up a skiffle group called the Quarrymen's image and later secured a skiffle group called the Quarrymen a recording contract with EMI. a skiffle group called the Quarrymen's first single, \"Love Me Do\", peaked at number 17 on the Record Retailer chart, and by the time a skiffle group called the Quarrymen's debut album, Please Please Me, was released in early 1963, Beatlemania had arrived. Often serious and focused while on stage with a skiffle group called the Quarrymen, George Harrison was known as \"the quiet Beatle\". the quiet Beatle arose when a skiffle group called the Quarrymen arrived in the United States in early 1964, and George Harrison was ill with a case of Strep throat and a fever and was medically advised to limit speaking as much as possible until George Harrison performed on The Ed Sullivan Show as scheduled. As such, the press noticed George Harrison's apparent laconic nature in public appearances on that tour and the subsequent nickname stuck, much to George Harrison's amusement. George Harrison had two lead vocal credits on the LP, including the Lennon\u2013[0] song \"Do You Want to Know a Secret?\", and three on their second album, With the Beatles (1963). their second album, With the Beatles (1963) included \"Don't Bother Me\", George Harrison's first solo writing credit.George Harrison served as a skiffle group called the Quarrymen's scout for new American releases, being especially knowledgeable about soul music. By 1965's Rubber Soul, George Harrison had begun to lead the other Beatles into folk rock through George Harrison's interest in the Byrds and Bob Dylan, and towards Indian classical music through George Harrison's use of the sitar on \"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)\".[nb 3] George Harrison later called 1965's Rubber Soul George Harrison's \"favourite [a skiffle group called the Quarrymen] album\". Revolver (1966) included three of George Harrison's compositions: \"Taxman\", selected as Revolver (1966)'s opening track, \"Love You To\" and \"I Want to Tell You\". George Harrison's drone-like tambura part on his friend John Lennon's \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" exemplified a skiffle group called the Quarrymen's ongoing exploration of non-Western instruments, while \"Love You To\" represented a skiffle group called the Quarrymen's first genuine foray into Indian music. According to the ethnomusicologist David Reck, \"Love You To\" set a precedent in popular music as an example of Asian culture being represented by Westerners respectfully and without parody. Author Nicholas Schaffner wrote in 1978 that following George Harrison's increased association with the sitar after \"Love You To\", George Harrison became known as \"the maharaja of raga-rock\". George Harrison continued to develop George Harrison's interest in non-Western instrumentation, playing swarmandal on \"Strawberry Fields Forever\".By late 1966, George Harrison's interests had moved away from a skiffle group called the Quarrymen. moved was reflected in George Harrison's choice of Eastern gurus and religious leaders for inclusion on the album cover for Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band in 1967.[nb 4] George Harrison's sole composition on the album was the Indian-inspired \"Within You Without You\", to which no other Beatle contributed. George Harrison played sitar and tambura on the Indian-inspired \"Within You Without You\", to which no other Beatle contributed, backed by musicians from the London Asian Music Circle on dilruba, swarmandal and tabla.[nb 5] George Harrison later commented on the Sgt. Pepper album: \"the album was a millstone and a milestone in the music industry\u00a0... There's about half the songs George Harrison like and the other half George Harrison can't stand.\"In January 1968, George Harrison recorded the basic track for his song \"The Inner Light\" at EMI's studio in Bombay, using a group of local musicians playing traditional Indian instruments. Released as the B-side to [0]'s \"Lady Madonna\", his song \"The Inner Light\" was the first George Harrison composition to appear on a a skiffle group called the Quarrymen single. Derived from a quotation from the Tao Te Ching, his song \"The Inner Light\"'s lyric reflected George Harrison's deepening interest in Hinduism and meditation. During the recording of The Beatles that same year, tensions within a skiffle group called the Quarrymen ran high, and drummer Ringo Starr quit briefly. George Harrison's four songwriting contributions to their second album, With the Beatles (1963) included \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\", which featured Eric Clapton on lead guitar, and the horn-driven \"Savoy Truffle\".Dylan and a skiffle group called the Quarrymen were a major musical influence on George Harrison at the end of George Harrison's career with a skiffle group called the Quarrymen. While on a visit to Woodstock in late 1968, George Harrison established a friendship with Dylan and found George Harrison drawn to a skiffle group called the Quarrymen's sense of communal music-making and to the creative equality among the band members, which contrasted with his friend John Lennon and McCartney's domination of a skiffle group called the Quarrymen's songwriting and creative direction. This coincided with a prolific period in George Harrison's songwriting and a growing desire to assert George Harrison's independence from a skiffle group called the Quarrymen. Tensions among a skiffle group called the Quarrymen surfaced again in January 1969, at Twickenham Studios, during the filmed rehearsals that became the 1970 documentary Let It Be. Frustrated by Twickenham Studios, by his friend John Lennon's creative disengagement from a skiffle group called the Quarrymen, and by what George Harrison perceived as a domineering attitude from [0], George Harrison quit a skiffle group called the Quarrymen on 10 January. George Harrison returned 12 days later, after his bandmates had agreed to move the film project to his bandmates's own Apple Studio and to abandon [0]'s plan for making a return to public performance.Relations among a skiffle group called the Quarrymen were more cordial, though still strained, when a skiffle group called the Quarrymen recorded a skiffle group called the Quarrymen's . their 1969 album Abbey Road included what Lavezzoli describes as \"two classic contributions\" from George Harrison \u2013 \"Here Comes the Sun\" and \"Something\" \u2013 that saw George Harrison \"finally achieve equal songwriting status\" with his friend John Lennon and [0]. During the recording of The Beatles that same year, George Harrison asserted more creative control than before, rejecting suggestions for changes to George Harrison's music, particularly from [0]. \"Something\" became George Harrison's first A-side when issued on a double A-side single with \"Come Together\"; \"Something\" was number one in Canada, Australia, New Zealand and West Germany, and the combined sides topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States. In the 1970s Frank Sinatra recorded \"Something\" twice (1970 and 1979) and later dubbed \"Something\" \"the greatest love song of the past fifty years\". his friend John Lennon considered \"Something\" the best song on their 1969 album Abbey Road, and \"Something\" became a skiffle group called the Quarrymen's second most covered song after \"Yesterday\".[nb 6]In May 1970, George Harrison's song \"For You Blue\" was coupled on a US single with [0]'s \"The Long and Winding Road\" and became George Harrison's second chart-topper when the sides were listed together at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. George Harrison's increased productivity meant that by the time of a skiffle group called the Quarrymen's George Harrison had amassed a stockpile of unreleased compositions. While George Harrison grew as a songwriter, George Harrison's compositional presence on a skiffle group called the Quarrymen albums remained limited to two or three songs, increasing George Harrison's frustration, and significantly contributing to a skiffle group called the Quarrymen's . George Harrison's last recording session with a skiffle group called the Quarrymen was on 4 January 1970, when George Harrison, [0] and Starr recorded George Harrison's song \"I Me Mine\" for the Let It Be soundtrack album."}, "Solo career: 1968\u20131987": {"Early solo work: 1968\u20131969": "[0] is our person to focus on. Before the Beatles' break-up, [0] had already recorded and released two solo albums: Wonderwall Music and Electronic Sound, both of which contain mainly instrumental compositions. Wonderwall Music blends Indian and Western instrumentation, while Electronic Sound is an experimental album that prominently features a Moog synthesizer. Released in November 1968, Wonderwall Music was the first solo album by a Beatle and the first LP released by Apple Records. Indian musicians Aashish Khan and Shivkumar Sharma performed on the album, which contains the experimental sound collage \"Dream Scene\", recorded several months before Lennon's \"Revolution 9\".In December 1969, [0] participated in a brief tour of Europe with the American group Delaney & Bonnie and Friends. During the tour, which included Clapton, Bobby Whitlock, drummer Jim Gordon and band leaders the American group Delaney & Bonnie and Bonnie Bramlett, [0] began to play slide guitar, and also began to write \"My Sweet Lord\", which became [0]'s first single as a solo artist.", "All Things Must Pass: 1970": "[0] is our person to focus on. For many years, [0] was restricted in [0]'s songwriting contributions to the Beatles''s albums, but [0] released All Things Must Pass, a triple album with two discs of his songs and the third of recordings of Harrison jamming with friends. All Things Must Pass, a triple album with two discs of his songs and the third of recordings of Harrison jamming with friends was regarded by many as [0]'s best work, and All Things Must Pass, a triple album with two discs of his songs and the third of recordings of Harrison jamming with friends topped the charts on both sides of the Atlantic.[nb 7] The number-one hit single \"My Sweet Lord\" and the top-ten single \"What Is Life\" were taken from All Things Must Pass, a triple album with two discs of his songs and the third of recordings of Harrison jamming with friends; the musicians included Starr, Clapton, Gary Wright, Billy Preston, Klaus Voormann, the whole of Delaney and Bonnie's Friends band, and the Apple group Badfinger.[nb 8] On All Things Must Pass, a triple album with two discs of his songs and the third of recordings of Harrison jamming with friends's release, All Things Must Pass, a triple album with two discs of his songs and the third of recordings of Harrison jamming with friends was received with critical acclaim; Ben Gerson of Rolling Stone described All Things Must Pass, a triple album with two discs of his songs and the third of recordings of Harrison jamming with friends as being \"of classic Spectorian proportions, Wagnerian, Brucknerian, the music of mountain tops and vast horizons\". Author and musicologist Ian Inglis considers the lyrics of All Things Must Pass, a triple album with two discs of his songs and the third of recordings of Harrison jamming with friends's title track \"a recognition of the impermanence of human existence\u00a0... a simple and poignant conclusion\" to the Beatles'. In 1971, Bright Tunes sued [0] for copyright infringement over The number-one hit single \"My Sweet Lord\", owing to The number-one hit single \"My Sweet Lord\"'s similarity to the 1963 Chiffons hit \"He's So Fine\". When sued was heard in the United States district court in 1976, [0] denied deliberately plagiarising The number-one hit single \"My Sweet Lord\", but lost sued, as the judge ruled that [0] had done so subconsciously.In 2000, Apple Records released a thirtieth-anniversary edition of the albumAll Things Must Pass, a triple album with two discs of his songs and the third of recordings of Harrison jamming with friends, and [0] actively participated in a thirtieth-anniversary edition of the album's promotion. In an interview, [0] reflected on All Things Must Pass, a triple album with two discs of his songs and the third of recordings of Harrison jamming with friends: \"All Things Must Pass, a triple album with two discs of his songs and the third of recordings of Harrison jamming with friends's just something that was like [0]'s continuation from the Beatles', really. It was [0] sort of getting out of the Beatles' and just going [0]'s own way\u00a0... it was a very happy occasion.\" [0] commented on the production: \"Well, in those days it was like the reverb was kind of used a bit more than what [0] would do now. In fact, [0] don't use reverb at all. [0] can't stand it\u00a0... You know, it's hard to go back to anything thirty years later and expect anything to be how you would want anything now.\"", "The Concert for Bangladesh: 1971": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] responded to a request from Ravi Shankar by organising a charity event, the Concert for Bangladesh, which took place on 1 August 1971. a charity event, the Concert for Bangladesh, which took place on 1 August 1971 drew over 40,000 people to two shows in New York's Madison Square Garden. The goal of a charity event, the Concert for Bangladesh, which took place on 1 August 1971 was to raise money to aid starving refugees during the Bangladesh Liberation War. Ravi Shankar opened a charity event, the Concert for Bangladesh, which took place on 1 August 1971.A triple album, The Concert for Bangladesh, was released by Apple in December, followed by a concert film in 1972.[nb 9] Credited to \"George Harrison and Friends\", A triple album, The Concert for Bangladesh topped the UK chart and peaked at number 2 in the US, and went on to win the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. Tax troubles and questionable expenses later tied up many of the proceeds, but [0] commented: \"Mainly a charity event, the Concert for Bangladesh, which took place on 1 August 1971 was to attract attention to the situation\u00a0... The money \"George Harrison and Friends\" raised was secondary, and although \"George Harrison and Friends\" had some money problems\u00a0... they still got plenty\u00a0... even though it was a drop in the ocean.

Harrison's 1973 album Living in the Material World held the number one spot on the Billboard albums chart for five weeks, and the album's single, \"Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)\", also reached number one in the US. In the UK, Harrison's 1973 album Living in the Material World peaked at number two and the album's single, \"Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)\" reached number 8. Harrison's 1973 album Living in the Material World was lavishly produced and packaged, and Harrison's 1973 album Living in the Material World's dominant message was [0]'s Hindu beliefs. In Greene's opinion Harrison's 1973 album Living in the Material World \"contained many of the strongest compositions of [0]'s career\". Stephen Holden, writing in Rolling Stone, felt Harrison's 1973 album Living in the Material World was \"vastly appealing\" and \"profoundly seductive\", and that Harrison's 1973 album Living in the Material World stood \"alone as an article of faith, miraculous in Harrison's 1973 album Living in the Material World's radiance\". Other reviewers were less enthusiastic, describing Harrison's 1973 album Living in the Material World as awkward, sanctimonious and overly sentimental.In November 1974, [0] became the first ex-Beatle to tour North America when [0] began his 45-date Dark Horse Tour. his 45-date Dark Horse Tour included guest spots by [0]'s band members Billy Preston and Tom Scott, and traditional and contemporary Indian music performed by \"Ravi Shankar, Family and Friends\". Despite numerous positive reviews, the consensus reaction to his 45-date Dark Horse Tour was negative. Some fans found Ravi Shankar's significant presence to be a bizarre disappointment, and many were affronted by what Inglis described as [0]'s \"sermonizing\". Further, [0] reworked the lyrics to several Beatles songs, and [0]'s laryngitis-affected vocals led to some critics calling his 45-date Dark Horse Tour \"dark hoarse\". The author Robert Rodriguez commented: \"While his 45-date Dark Horse Tour might be considered a noble failure, there were a number of fans who were tuned-in to what was being attempted. a number of fans who were tuned-in to what was being attempted went away ecstatic, conscious that a number of fans who were tuned-in to what was being attempted had just witnessed something so uplifting that it could never be repeatedsomething so uplifting that it could never be repeated .\" Simon Leng called his 45-date Dark Horse Tour \"groundbreaking\" and \"revolutionary in his 45-date Dark Horse Tour's presentation of Indian Music\".In December, [0] released Dark Horse, which was an album that earned him the least favourable reviews of his career. Rolling Stone called Dark Horse, which was an album that earned him the least favourable reviews of his career \"the chronicle of a performer out of [0]'s element, working to a deadline, enfeebling [0]'s overtaxed talents by a rush to deliver a new 'LP product', rehearse a band, and assemble a cross-country tour, all within three weeks\". Dark Horse, which was an album that earned him the least favourable reviews of his career reached number 4 on the Billboard albums chart and the single \"Dark Horse\" reached number 15, but they failed to make an impact in the UK.[nb 10] The music critic Mikal Gilmore described Dark Horse, which was an album that earned him the least favourable reviews of his career as \"one of [0]'s most fascinating works \u2013 a record about change and loss\".Harrison's final studio album for EMI and Apple Records, the soul music-inspired Extra Texture (Read All About It) (1975), peaked at number 8 on the Billboard albums chart and number 16 in the UK. [0] considered Harrison's final studio album for EMI and Apple Records, the soul music-inspired Extra Texture (Read All About It) (1975) the least satisfactory of the three albums [0] had recorded since All Things Must Pass. Simon Leng identified \"bitterness and dismay\" in many of the tracks; his long-time friend Klaus Voormann commented: \"[0] wasn't up for it\u00a0... It was a terrible time because his long-time friend Klaus Voormann think there was a lot of cocaine going around, and that's when his long-time friend Klaus Voormann got out of the picture\u00a0... his long-time friend Klaus Voormann didn't like [0]'s frame of mind\". [0] released two singles from Harrison's final studio album for EMI and Apple Records, the soul music-inspired Extra Texture (Read All About It) (1975): \"You\", which reached the Billboard top 20, and \"This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)\", Apple Records's final original single release.Thirty Three & 1/3 (1976), Harrison's first album release on his own Dark Horse Records label, produced the hit singles \"This Song\" and \"Crackerbox Palace\", both of which reached the top 25 in the US.[nb 11] The surreal humour of \"Crackerbox Palace\" reflected [0]'s association with Monty Python's Eric Idle, who directed a comical music video for \"Crackerbox Palace\". With an emphasis on melody and musicianship, and a more subtle subject matter than the pious message of [0]'s earlier works, Thirty Three & 1/3 earned [0] [0]'s most favourable critical notices in the US since All Things Must Pass. Thirty Three & 1/3 (1976), Harrison's first album release on his own Dark Horse Records label, peaked just outside the top ten there, but outsold [0]'s previous two LPs. As part of [0]'s promotion for Thirty Three & 1/3 (1976), Harrison's first album release on his own Dark Horse Records label,, [0] performed on Saturday Night Live with Paul Simon.In 1979, [0] released George Harrison, which followed [0]'s second marriage and the birth of [0]'s son Dhani. Co-produced by Russ Titelman, Thirty Three & 1/3 (1976), Harrison's first album release on his own Dark Horse Records label, and the album's single, \"Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)\" both made the Billboard top 20. Thirty Three & 1/3 (1976), Harrison's first album release on his own Dark Horse Records label, marked the beginning of [0]'s gradual retreat from the music business, with several of the songs having been written in the tranquil setting of Maui in the Hawaiian archipelago.

The murder of John Lennon on 8 December 1980 disturbed [0] and reinforced [0]'s decades-long concern about stalkers. The murder of John Lennon on 8 December 1980 was also a deep personal loss, although Harrison and Lennon had little contact in the years before John Lennon was killed.[nb 12] Following The murder of John Lennon on 8 December 1980, [0] commented: \"After all Harrison and Lennon went through together [0] had and still have great love and respect for John Lennon.

During five years [0] made several guest appearances, including a 1985 performance at a tribute to Carl Perkins titled Blue Suede Shoes: A Rockabilly Session.[nb 13] In March 1986 [0] made a surprise appearance during the finale of the Birmingham Heart Beat Charity Concert, an event organised to raise money for the Birmingham Children's Hospital.

In October 1989, [0] assembled and released Best of Dark Horse 1976\u20131989, a compilation of his later solo work. Best of Dark Horse 1976\u20131989, a compilation of his later solo work included three new songs, including \"Cheer Down\", which [0] had recently contributed to the Lethal Weapon 2 film soundtrack.Following Roy Orbison's death in December 1988, the Traveling Wilburys recorded as a four-piece. their second album was mischievously titled Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3. According to Jeff Lynne, \"titled was [0]'s idea.

In May, [0] represented the Beatles at London's High Court in the Beatles's successful bid to gain control of unauthorised recordings made of a 1962 performance by the Beatles at the Star-Club in Hamburg. The following year, [0] was the most active of the Beatles in promoting the reissue of the Beatles's 1968 animated film Yellow Submarine.On 30 December 1999, Harrison and his wife Olivia were attacked at Harrison and his wife Olivia's home, Friar Park. Michael Abram, a 34-year-old paranoid schizophrenic, broke in and attacked [0] with a kitchen knife, puncturing a lung and causing head injuries before his wife Olivia incapacitated Michael Abram, a 34-year-old paranoid schizophrenic, by striking Michael Abram, a 34-year-old paranoid schizophrenic, repeatedly with a fireplace poker and a lamp.

[0]'s guitar work with the Beatles was varied and flexible. Although not fast or flashy, [0]'s lead guitar playing was solid and typified the more subdued lead guitar style of the early 1960s. [0]'s rhythm guitar playing was innovative, for example when [0] used a capo to shorten the strings on an acoustic guitar, as on the Rubber Soul (1965) album and \"Here Comes the Sun\", to create a bright, sweet sound. Eric Clapton felt that [0] was \"clearly an innovator\" as [0] was \"taking certain elements of R&B and rock and rockabilly and creating something unique\". Rolling Stone founder Jann Wenner described [0] as \"a guitarist who was never showy but who had an innate, eloquent melodic sense. [0] played exquisitely in the service of the song\". The guitar picking style of Chet Atkins and Carl Perkins influenced [0], giving a country music feel to many of the Beatles's recordings. [0] identified Chuck Berry as another early influence.In 1961, the Beatles recorded \"Cry for a Shadow\", a blues-inspired instrumental co-written by Lennon and [0]the song's's , building on unusual chord voicings and imitating the style of other English groups such as the Shadows. [0]'s liberal use of the diatonic scale in [0]'s guitar playing reveals the influence of Buddy Holly, and [0]'s interest in Chuck Berry inspired [0] to compose songs based on the blues scale while incorporating a rockabilly feel in the style of Perkins.[nb 18] Another of [0]'s musical techniques was the use of guitar lines written in octaves, as on \"I'll Be on My Way\".By 1964, [0] had begun to develop a distinctive personal style as a guitarist, writing parts that featured the use of nonresolving tones, as with the ending chord arpeggios on \"A Hard Day's Night\". On \"A Hard Day's Night\" and other songs from the period, [0] used a Rickenbacker 360/12 \u2013 an electric guitar with twelve strings, the low eight of which are tuned in pairs, one octave apart, with the higher four being pairs tuned in unison. [0]'s use of the Rickenbacker on A Hard Day's Night helped to popularise the Rickenbacker, and the jangly sound became so prominent that Melody Maker termed the jangly sound the Beatles's \"secret weapon\".[nb 19] In 1964, [0] used an expression pedal to control [0]'s guitar's volume on \"I Need You\", creating a syncopated flautando effect with the melody resolving the melody's dissonance through tonal displacements. [0] used the same volume-swell technique on \"Yes It Is\", applying what Everett described as \"ghostly articulation\" to the song's's natural harmonics.In 1966, [0] contributed innovative musical ideas to Revolver. [0] played backwards guitar on Lennon's composition \"I'm Only Sleeping\" and a guitar counter-melody on \"And Your Bird Can Sing\" that moved in parallel octaves above McCartney's bass downbeats. [0]'s guitar playing on \"I Want to Tell You\" exemplified the pairing of altered chordal colours with descending chromatic lines and [0]'s guitar part for Sgt Pepper's \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\" mirrors Lennon's vocal line in much the same way that a sarangi player accompanies a khyal singer in a Hindu devotional song.Everett described [0]'s guitar solo from \"Old Brown Shoe\" as \"stinging [and] highly Claptonesque\". Everett identified two of \"Old Brown Shoe\"'s significant motifs: a bluesy trichord and a diminished triad with roots in A and E. Huntley called \"Old Brown Shoe\" \"a sizzling rocker with a ferocious\u00a0... solo\". In Greene's opinion, [0]'s demo for \"Old Brown Shoe\" contains \"one of the most complex lead guitar solos on any the Beatles song\".[0]'s playing on Abbey Road, and in particular on \"Something\", marked a significant moment in [0]'s development as a guitarist. The song's guitar solo shows a varied range of influences, incorporating the blues guitar style of Clapton and the styles of Indian gamakas. According to author and musicologist Kenneth Womack: \"\"Something\" meanders toward the most unforgettable of [0]'s guitar solos\u00a0... A masterpiece in simplicity, [\"Something\"] reaches toward the sublime\".After Delaney Bramlett inspired [0] to learn slide guitar, [0] began to incorporate slide guitar into [0]'s solo work, which allowed [0] to mimic many traditional Indian instruments, including the sarangi and the dilruba. Leng described The song's guitar solo as a departure for \"the sweet soloist of 'Something'\", calling The song's guitar solo \"rightly famed\u00a0... one of [0]'s greatest guitar statements\". Lennon commented: \"The song's guitar solo's the best [0]'s ever fucking played in [0]'s life.\"A Hawaiian influence is notable in much of [0]'s music, ranging from [0]'s slide guitar work on Gone Troppo (1982) to [0]'s televised performance of the Cab Calloway standard \"Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea\" on ukulele in 1992. Lavezzoli described Harrison's slide playing on the Grammy-winning instrumental \"Marwa Blues\" (2002) as demonstrating Hawaiian influences while comparing the melody to an Indian sarod or veena, calling Harrison's slide playing on the Grammy-winning instrumental \"Marwa Blues\" (2002) \"yet another demonstration of [0]'s unique slide approach\". [0] was an admirer of George Formby and a member of the Ukulele Society of Great Britain, and played a ukulele solo in the style of George Formby at the end of \"Free as a Bird\". [0] performed at a George Formby convention in 1991, and served as the honorary president of the George Formby Appreciation Society. [0] played bass guitar on a few tracks, including the the Beatles songs \"She Said She Said\", \"Golden Slumbers\", \"Birthday\" and \"Honey Pie\". [0] also played bass on several solo recordings, including \"Faster\", \"Wake Up My Love\" and \"Bye Bye Love\".", "Sitar and Indian music": "[0] is our person to focus on. During the Beatles''s American tour in August 1965, [0]'s friend David Crosby of the Byrds introduced [0] to Indian classical music and the work of sitar maestro Ravi Shankar. [0] described sitar maestro Ravi Shankar as \"the first person who ever impressed [0] in [0]'s life\u00a0... and sitar maestro Ravi Shankar was the only person who didn't try to impress [0].\" [0] became fascinated with the sitar and immersed [0] in Indian music. According to Lavezzoli, [0]'s introduction of the sitar on the Beatles' song \"Norwegian Wood\" \"opened the floodgates for Indian instrumentation in rock music, triggering what sitar maestro Ravi Shankar would call 'The Great Sitar Explosion' of 1966\u201367\". Lavezzoli recognises [0] as \"the man most responsible for this phenomenon\".[nb 20]In June 1966, [0] met sitar maestro Ravi Shankar at the home of Mrs Angadi of the Asian Music Circle, asked to be sitar maestro Ravi Shankar's student, and was accepted. Before met, [0] had recorded [0]'s Revolver track \"Love You To\", contributing a sitar part that Lavezzoli describes as an \"astonishing improvement\" over the Beatles' song \"Norwegian Wood\" and \"the most accomplished performance on sitar by any rock musician\". On 6 July, [0] travelled to India to buy a sitar from Rikhi Ram & Sons in New Delhi. In September, following the Beatles''s final tour, [0] returned to India to study sitar for six weeks with sitar maestro Ravi Shankar. [0] initially stayed in Bombay until fans learned of [0]'s arrival, then moved to a houseboat on a remote lake in Kashmir. During this visit, [0] also received tutelage from Shambhu Das, sitar maestro Ravi Shankar's prot\u00e9g\u00e9.[0] studied the sitar until 1968, when, following a discussion with sitar maestro Ravi Shankar about the need to find [0]'s \"roots\", an encounter with Clapton and Jimi Hendrix at a hotel in New York convinced [0] to return to guitar playing. [0] commented: \"[0] decided\u00a0... [0]'m not going to be a great sitar player\u00a0... because [0] should have started at least fifteen years earlier.\" [0] continued to use Indian instrumentation occasionally on [0]'s solo albums and remained strongly associated with the genre. Lavezzoli groups [0] with Paul Simon and Peter Gabriel as the three rock musicians who have given the most \"mainstream exposure to non-Western musics, or the concept of 'world music'\".", "Songwriting": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] wrote his first song, \"Don't Bother Me\", while sick in a hotel bed in Bournemouth during August 1963, as \"an exercise to see if [0] could write a song\", as [0] remembered. [0]'s songwriting ability improved throughout the Beatles''s career, but [0]'s material did not earn full respect from Lennon, McCartney and producer George Martin until near the Beatles''s break-up. In 1969, McCartney told Lennon: \"Until this year, the Beatles''s songs have been better than [0]'s. Now this year [0]'s songs are at least as good as the Beatles'\". [0] often had difficulty getting the Beatles' to record [0]'s songs. Most the Beatles' albums from 1965 onwards contain at least two [0] compositions; three of [0]'s songs appear on Revolver, \"the album on which [0] came of age as a songwriter\", according to Inglis.[0] wrote the chord progression of his first song, \"Don't Bother Me\" almost exclusively in the Dorian mode, demonstrating an interest in exotic tones that eventually culminated in [0]'s embrace of Indian music. Indian music proved a strong influence on [0]'s songwriting and contributed to [0]'s innovation within the Beatles'. According to Mikal Gilmore of Rolling Stone, \"[0]'s openness to new sounds and textures cleared new paths for [0]'s rock and roll compositions. [0]'s use of dissonance on\u00a0... 'Taxman' and 'I Want to Tell You' was revolutionary in popular music \u2013 and perhaps more originally creative than the avant-garde mannerisms that Lennon and McCartney borrowed from the music of Karlheinz Stockhausen, Luciano Berio, Edgard Var\u00e8se and Igor Stravinsky\u00a0...\"Of the 1967 Harrison song \"Within You Without You\", author Gerry Farrell said that [0] had created a \"new form\", calling the 1967 Harrison song \"Within You Without You\" \"a quintessential fusion of pop and Indian music\". Lennon called the 1967 Harrison song \"Within You Without You\" one of [0]'s best: \"[0]'s mind and [0]'s music are clear. There is [0]'s innate talent, [0] brought that sound together.\" In [0]'s next fully Indian-styled song, \"The Inner Light\", [0] embraced the Karnatak discipline of Indian music, rather than the Hindustani style [0] had used in \"Love You To\" and \"Within You Without You\". Writing in 1997, author Gerry Farrell commented: \"It is a mark of [0]'s sincere involvement with Indian music that, nearly thirty years on, the Beatles''s 'Indian' songs remain the most imaginative and successful examples of this type of fusion \u2013 for example, 'Blue Jay Way' and 'The Inner Light'.\"Beatles biographer Bob Spitz described the 1967 Harrison song \"Within You Without You\" as a masterpiece, and \"an intensely stirring romantic ballad that would challenge 'Yesterday' and 'Michelle' as one of the most recognizable songs the Beatles' ever produced\". Inglis considered Abbey Road a turning point in [0]'s development as a songwriter and musician. Inglis described Harrison's two contributions to the LP, \"Here Comes the Sun\" and \"Something\", as \"exquisite\", declaring Harrison's two contributions to the LP, \"Here Comes the Sun\" and \"Something\", equal to any previous the Beatles' songs.", "Collaborations": "[0] is our person to focus on. From 1968 onwards, [0] collaborated with other musicians; [0] brought in Eric Clapton to play lead guitar on \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" for the 1968 Beatles' White Album, and collaborated with John Barham on John Barham's 1968 debut solo album, Wonderwall Music, which included contributions from Eric Clapton, as well as Peter Tork from the Monkees.

Also 1971, [0] produced and played slide guitar on Badfinger's top ten hit \"Day After Day\", and a dobro on Billy Preston's \"I Wrote a Simple Song\".[nb 21] [0] worked with Harry Nilsson on \"You're Breakin' My Heart\" (1972) and with Cheech & Chong on \"Basketball Jones\" (1973).In 1974, [0] founded Dark Horse Records as an avenue for collaboration with other musicians. [0] wanted Dark Horse Records to serve as a creative outlet for artists, as Apple Records had for the Beatles. Eric Idle commented: \"[0]'s extremely generous, and [0] backs and supports all sorts of people that you'll never, ever hear of.\" The first acts signed to Dark Horse Records were Ravi Shankar and the duo Splinter. [0] produced and made multiple musical contributions to the duo Splinter's debut album, The Place I Love, which provided Dark Horse Records with Dark Horse Records's first hit, \"Costafine Town\".

In 1996, [0] recorded \"Distance Makes No Difference With Love\" with Carl Perkins for Carl Perkins's album Go Cat Go!, and, in 1990, [0] played slide guitar on the title track of Dylan's Under the Red Sky album. In 2001, [0] performed as a guest musician on Jeff Lynne and Electric Light Orchestra's comeback album Zoom, and on the song \"Love Letters\" for Bill Wyman's Rhythm Kings. [0] also co-wrote a new song with [0]'s son Dhani, \"Horse to the Water\", which was recorded on 2 October, eight weeks before [0]'s death. a new song appeared on Jools Holland's album Small World, Big Band.", "Guitars": "[0] is our person to focus on. When [0] joined the Quarrymen in 1958, [0]'s main guitar was a H\u00f6fner President Acoustic, which [0] soon traded for a H\u00f6fner Club 40 model. [0]'s first solid-body electric guitar was a Czech-built Jolana Futurama/Grazioso. The guitars [0] used on early recordings were mainly Gretsch models, played through a Vox amplifier, including a Gretsch Duo Jet that [0] bought secondhand in 1961 and posed with on the album cover for Cloud Nine (1987). [0] also bought a Gretsch Tennessean and a Gretsch Country Gentleman, which [0] played on \"She Loves You\", and during the Beatles' 1964 appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show. In 1963, [0] bought a Rickenbacker 425 Fireglo, and in 1964 [0] acquired a Rickenbacker 360/12 guitar, which was the second of its kind to be manufactured. [0] obtained his first Fender Stratocaster in 1965 and first used his first Fender Stratocaster during the recording of the Help! album that February; [0] also used his first Fender Stratocaster when recording Rubber Soul later that year, most notably on the song \"Nowhere Man\".In early 1966, Harrison and Lennon each purchased Epiphone Casinos, which Harrison and Lennon used on Revolver. [0] also used a Gibson J-160E and a Gibson SG Standard while recording the Help! album. [0] later painted his first Fender Stratocaster in a psychedelic design that included the word \"Bebopalula\" above the pickguard and his first Fender Stratocaster's nickname, \"Rocky\", on the headstock. [0] played his first Fender Stratocaster in the Magical Mystery Tour (1967) film and throughout [0]'s solo career. In July 1968, Clapton gave [0] a Gibson Les Paul  that had been stripped of its original finish and stained cherry red, which [0] nicknamed \"Lucy\". Around this time, [0] obtained a Gibson Jumbo J-200 acoustic guitar, which [0] subsequently gave to Dylan to use at the 1969 Isle of Wight Festival. In late 1968, Fender Musical Instruments Corporation gave [0] a custom-made Fender Telecaster Rosewood prototype, made especially for [0] by Philip Kubicki.[nb 22] In August 2017, Fender Musical Instruments Corporation released a \"Limited Edition [0] Rosewood Telecaster\" modelled after a Telecaster that Roger Rossmeisl originally created for [0].", "": ""}, "Film production and HandMade films": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on.

In 1973, [0] produced the feature film Little Malcolm, but the feature film Little Malcolm was lost amid the litigation surrounding the former Beatles ending the former Beatles's business ties with Apple manager Allen Klein.In 1973, Peter Sellers introduced [0] to Denis O'Brien. Soon after, the two went into business together. In 1978, to produce Monty Python's Life of Brian, the two formed the film production and distribution company HandMade Films. the two's opportunity for investment came after EMI Films withdrew funding at the demand of EMI Films's chief executive, Bernard Delfont. [0] financed the production of Monty Python's Life of Brian in part by mortgaging [0]'s home, which Idle later called \"the most anybody's ever paid for a cinema ticket in history\". Monty Python's Life of Brian grossed $21\u00a0million at the box office in the US. The first film distributed by the film production and distribution company HandMade Films was The Long Good Friday (1980), and the first the film production and distribution company HandMade Films produced was Time Bandits (1981), a co-scripted project by Monty Python's Terry Gilliam and Michael Palin.

According to Ian Inglis, \"[Harrison's] executive role in the film production and distribution company HandMade Films helped to sustain British cinema at a time of crisis, producing some of the US's most memorable movies of the 1980s.\" Following a series of box office bombs in the late 1980s, and excessive debt incurred by Denis O'Brien which was guaranteed by [0], HandMade's financial situation became precarious. the film production and distribution company HandMade Films ceased operations in 1991 and was sold three years later to Paragon Entertainment, a Canadian corporation.

[0] was involved in humanitarian and political activism throughout [0]'s life. In the 1960s, the Beatles supported the civil rights movement and protested against the Vietnam War. In early 1971, Ravi Shankar consulted [0] about how to provide aid to the people of Bangladesh after the 1970 Bhola cyclone and the Bangladesh Liberation War. [0] hastily wrote and recorded the song \"Bangla Desh\", which became pop music's first charity single when issued by Apple Records in late July. [0] also pushed Apple Records to release Ravi Shankar's Joi Bangla EP in an effort to raise further awareness for the cause. Ravi Shankar asked for [0]'s advice about planning a small charity event in the US. [0] responded by organising the Concert for Bangladesh, which raised more than $240,000. Around $13.5\u00a0million was generated through the album and film releases, although most of Around $13.5\u00a0million were frozen in an Internal Revenue Service audit for ten years, due to Klein's's failure to register the Concert for Bangladesh, which raised more than $240,000 as a UNICEF benefit beforehand. In June 1972, UNICEF honoured Harrison and Shankar, and Klein, with the \"Child Is the Father of Man\" award at an annual ceremony in recognition of Harrison and Shankar, and Klein,'s fundraising efforts for Bangladesh.From 1980, [0] became a vocal supporter of Greenpeace and CND.

[0] recorded a benefit single, \"Nobody's Child\", with the Traveling Wilburys, and assembled a fundraising album with contributions from other artists including Clapton, Starr, Elton John, Stevie Wonder, Donovan and Van Morrison.the Concert for Bangladesh, which raised more than $240,000 has been described as an innovative precursor for the large-scale charity rock shows that followed, including Live Aid. The [0] Humanitarian Fund for UNICEF, a joint effort between the Harrison family and the US Fund for UNICEF, aims to support programmes that help children caught in humanitarian emergencies. In December 2007, the Harrison family and the US Fund for UNICEF donated $450,000 to help the victims of Cyclone Sidr in Bangladesh. On 13 October 2009, the first George Harrison Humanitarian Award went to Ravi Shankar for Ravi Shankar's efforts in saving the lives of children, and Ravi Shankar's involvement with the Concert for Bangladesh, which raised more than $240,000."}, "Personal life": {"Hinduism": "[0] is our person to focus on. By the mid-1960s, [0] had become an admirer of Indian culture and mysticism, introducing Indian culture and mysticism to the other Beatles. During the filming of Help! in the Bahamas, the other Beatles met the founder of Sivananda Yoga, Swami Vishnu-devananda, who gave each of them a signed copy of his book, The Complete Illustrated Book of Yogathe founder of Sivananda Yoga, Swami Vishnu-devananda, who gave each of them a signed copy of his book, The Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga's . Between the end of the last the other Beatles tour in 1966 and the beginning of the Sgt Pepper recording sessions, [0] made a pilgrimage to India with [0]'s first wife, Pattie Boyd; there, [0] studied sitar with Ravi Shankar, met several gurus, and visited various holy places. In 1968, [0] travelled with the other Beatles to Rishikesh in northern India to study meditation with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.[nb 24]Harrison's experiences with LSD in the mid-1960s served as a catalyst for [0]'s early pursuance of Hinduism. In a 1977 interview, [0] recalled:For [0], it was like a flash. The first time [0] had acid, acid just opened up something in [0]'s head that was inside of [0], and [0] realized a lot of things. [0] didn't learn a lot of things because [0] already knew a lot of things, but acid happened to be the key that opened the door to reveal a lot of things. From the moment [0] had acid, [0] wanted to have it all the time \u2013 these thoughts about the yogis and the Himalayas, and Ravi Shankar's music. However, [0] stopped using LSD after a disenchanting experience in San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury neighborhood. [0] recounted in The Beatles Anthology:a disenchanting experience in San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury neighborhood was the turning point for [0] \u2013 a disenchanting experience in San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury neighborhood's when [0] went right off the whole drug cult and stopped taking LSD. [0] had some in a little bottle \u2013 some was liquid. [0] put some under a microscope, and some looked like bits of old rope. [0] thought that [0] couldn't put LSD into [0]'s brain any more. In line with the Hindu yoga tradition, [0] became a vegetarian in the late 1960s. After being given various religious texts by Ravi Shankar in 1966, [0] remained a lifelong advocate of the teachings of Swami Vivekananda and Paramahansa Yogananda \u2013 yogis and authors, respectively, of Raja Yoga and Autobiography of a Yogi. In mid-1969, [0] produced the single \"Hare Krishna Mantra\", performed by members of the London Radha Krishna Temple. Having also helped the Temple devotees the London Radha Krishna Temple become established in Britain, [0] then met the Temple devotees's leader, A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, whom [0] described as \"[0]'s friend ... [0]'s master\" and \"a perfect example of everything he preached\". [0] embraced the Hare Krishna tradition, particularly japa-yoga chanting with beads, and became a lifelong devotee. In 1972 [0] donated his Letchmore Heath mansion north of London to the Temple devotees. his Letchmore Heath mansion north of London was later converted to a temple and renamed Bhaktivedanta Manor.Regarding other faiths, [0] once remarked: \"All religions are branches of one big tree. It doesn't matter what you call Him just as long as you call.\" [0] commented on [0]'s beliefs:Krishna actually was in a body as a person\u00a0... What makes it complicated is, if Krishna's God, what's Krishna doing fighting on a battlefield? It took [0] ages to try to figure that out, and again it was Yogananda's spiritual interpretation of the Bhagavad Gita that made [0] realise what that was. Our idea of Krishna and Arjuna on the battlefield in the chariot. So this is the point \u2013 that Krishna and Arjuna're in these bodies, which is like a kind of chariot, and Krishna and Arjuna're going through this incarnation, this life, which is kind of a battlefield. The senses of the body\u00a0... are the horses pulling the chariot, and Krishna and Arjuna have to get control over the chariot by getting control over the reins. And Arjuna in the end says, \"Please Krishna, Krishna drive the chariot\" because unless Krishna and Arjuna bring Christ or Krishna or Buddha or whichever of Krishna and Arjuna's spiritual guides\u00a0... Krishna and Arjuna're going to crash Krishna and Arjuna's , and Krishna and Arjuna're going to turn over, and Krishna and Arjuna're going to get killed in the battlefield. That's why we say \"Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna\", asking Krishna to come and take over the chariot. Inglis comments that \"[0]'s spiritual journey was seen as a serious and important development that reflected popular music's increasing maturity\u00a0... what [0], and the Beatles, had managed to overturn was the paternalistic assumption that popular musicians had no role other than to stand on stage and sing popular musicians's hit songs.\"", "Family and interests": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] married model Pattie Boyd on 21 January 1966, with McCartney serving as best man. Harrison and Boyd had met on set in 1964 during the production of the film A Hard Day's Night, in which model Pattie Boyd had been cast as a schoolgirl. During a lunch break, [0] 'playfully' proposed to model Pattie Boyd. Harrison and Boyd separated in 1974 and Harrison and Boyd's was finalised in 1977. model Pattie Boyd said model Pattie Boyd's decision to end their divorce was due largely to [0]'s repeated infidelities. The last infidelity culminated in an affair with Ringo's wife Maureen, which model Pattie Boyd called \"the final straw\". model Pattie Boyd characterised the last year of Harrison and Boyd's as \"fuelled by alcohol and cocaine\", and model Pattie Boyd stated: \"[0] used coke excessively, and model Pattie Boyd think coke changed [0]\u00a0... coke froze [0]'s emotions and hardened [0]'s heart.\" model Pattie Boyd subsequently moved in with Eric Clapton, and they married in 1979.[nb 25]On 2 September 1978, [0] married Olivia Trinidad Arias, who was a marketing executive for A&M Records, and later Dark Horse Records.
