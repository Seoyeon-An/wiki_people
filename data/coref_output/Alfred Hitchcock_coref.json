[0] is widely regarded as one of the most influential figures in the history of cinema. In a career spanning six decades, [0] directed over 50 feature films, many of which are still widely watched and studied today. Known as the \"Master of Suspense\", [0] became as well known as any of [0]'s actors thanks to [0]'s many interviews, [0]'s cameo roles in most of his films, and [0]'s hosting and producing the television anthology Alfred Hitchcock Presents (1955\u201365). his films garnered 46 Academy Award nominations, including six wins, although [0] never won the award for Best Director, despite five nominations.[0] initially trained as a technical clerk and copywriter before entering the film industry in 1919 as a title card designer. [0]'s directorial debut was the British-German silent film The Pleasure Garden (1925). [0]'s first successful film, The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog (1927), helped to shape the thriller genre, and Blackmail (1929) was the first British \"talkie\". [0]'s thrillers The 39 Steps (1935) and The Lady Vanishes (1938) are ranked among the greatest British films of the 20th century. By 1939, [0] had international recognition and producer David O. Selznick persuaded [0] to move to Hollywood. A string of successful films followed, including Rebecca (1940), Foreign Correspondent (1940), Suspicion (1941), Shadow of a Doubt (1943) and Notorious (1946).

[0] was born on 13 August 1899 in the flat above his parents''s leased greengrocer's shop at 517 High Road in Leytonstone, which was then part of Essex (now on the outskirts of East London). [0] was the son of Emma Jane (n\u00e9e Whelan; 1863\u20131942) and William Edgar Hitchcock (1862\u20131914), and had an older brother named William Daniel (1890\u20131943) and an older sister named Ellen Kathleen (1892\u20131979) who used the nickname \"Nellie\". his parents' were both Roman Catholics with partial Irish ancestry. William Edgar Hitchcock (1862\u20131914) was a greengrocer, as [0]'s grandfather had been. There was a large extended family, including uncle John Hitchcock with his five-bedroom Victorian house on Campion Road in Putney, complete with a maid, cook, chauffeur, and gardeneruncle John Hitchcock with his five-bedroom Victorian house on Campion Road in Putney, complete with a maid, cook, chauffeur, and gardener's . Every summer, uncle John Hitchcock with his five-bedroom Victorian house on Campion Road in Putney, complete with a maid, cook, chauffeur, and gardener rented a seaside house for the family in Cliftonville. [0] said that [0] first became class-conscious there, noticing the differences between tourists and locals.Describing [0] as a well-behaved boy \u2014 William Edgar Hitchcock (1862\u20131914) called [0] William Edgar Hitchcock (1862\u20131914)'s \"little lamb without a spot\" \u2014 [0] said [0] could not remember ever having had a playmate. One of [0]'s favourite stories for interviewers was about William Edgar Hitchcock (1862\u20131914) sending [0] to the local police station with a note when [0] was five; the policeman looked at a note and locked [0] in a cell for a few minutes, saying, \"locked is what we do to naughty boys.\" The experience left [0] with a lifelong phobia of law enforcement, and [0] told Tom Snyder in 1973 that [0] was \"scared stiff of anything\u00a0... to do with the law\" and that [0] would refuse to even drive a car in case [0] got a parking ticket. When [0] was six, the family moved to Limehouse and leased two stores at 130 and 175 Salmon Lane, which the family ran as a fish-and-chip shop and fishmongers' respectively; the family lived above 175 Salmon Lane. [0] attended his first school, the Howrah House Convent in Poplar, which he entered in 1907, at age 7. According to biographer Patrick McGilligan, [0] stayed at his first school, the Howrah House Convent in Poplar, which he entered in 1907, at age 7 for at most two years. [0] also attended a convent school, the Wode Street School \"for the daughters of gentlemen and little boys\" run by the Faithful Companions of Jesus. [0] then attended a primary school near [0]'s home and was for a short time a boarder at Salesian College in Battersea.the family moved again when [0] was eleven, this time to Putney, and on 5 October 1910 [0] was sent to St Ignatius College in Stamford Hill, a Jesuit grammar school with a reputation for discipline. As corporal punishment, the priests used a flat, hard, springy tool made of gutta-percha and known as a \"ferula\" which struck the whole palm; punishment was always at the end of the day, so the boys had to sit through classes anticipating the punishment if the boys had been written up for the punishment. [0] later said that St Ignatius College in Stamford Hill, a Jesuit grammar school with a reputation for discipline is where [0] developed [0]'s sense of fear. The school register lists [0]'s year of birth as 1900 rather than 1899; biographer Donald Spoto says [0] was deliberately enrolled as a ten-year-old because [0] was a year behind with [0]'s schooling. While biographer Gene Adair reports that [0] was \"an average, or slightly above-average, pupil\", [0] said that [0] was \"usually among the four or five at the top of the class\"; at the end of [0]'s first year, [0]'s work in Latin, English, French and religious education was noted. [0] told Peter Bogdanovich: \"The Jesuits taught [0] organisation, control and, to some degree, analysis.[0]'s favourite subject was geography and [0] became interested in maps and the timetables of trains, trams and buses; according to John Russell Taylor, [0] could recite all the stops on the Orient Express. [0] had a particular interest in London trams. An overwhelming majority of [0]'s films include rail or tram scenes, in particular The Lady Vanishes, Strangers on a Train and Number Seventeen. A clapperboard shows the number of the scene and the number of takes, and [0] would often take the two numbers on A clapperboard and whisper the London tram route names. For example, if A clapperboard showed \"Scene 23; Take 3\", [0] would whisper \"Woodford, Hampstead\"\u2014Woodford being the terminus of the route 23 tram, and Hampstead\"\u2014Woodford the end of route [0] told his parents' that [0] wanted to be an engineer, and on 25 July 1913, [0] left St Ignatius College in Stamford Hill, a Jesuit grammar school with a reputation for discipline and enrolled in night classes at the London County Council School of Engineering and Navigation in Poplar. In a book-length interview in 1962, [0] told biographer Patrick McGilligan that [0] had studied \"mechanics, electricity, acoustics, and navigation\". Then, on 12 December 1914, [0]'s father, who had been suffering from emphysema and kidney disease, died at the age of 52. To support himself and his mother \u2014 [0]'s older siblings had left home by then \u2014 [0] took a job, for 15 shillings a week (\u00a377 in 2021), as a technical clerk at the Henley Telegraph and Cable Company in Blomfield Street, near London Wall. [0] continued night classes, this time in art history, painting, economics and political science. [0]'s older brother ran the family shops, while himself and his mother continued to live in Salmon Lane.[0] was too young to enlist when the First World War started in July 1914, and when [0] reached the required age of 18 in 1917, [0] received a C3 classification (\"free from serious organic disease, able to stand service conditions in garrisons at home\u00a0... only suitable for sedentary work\"). [0] joined a cadet regiment of the Royal Engineers and took part in theoretical briefings, weekend drills and exercises. John Russell Taylor wrote that, in one session of practical exercises in Hyde Park, [0] was required to wear puttees. [0] could never master wrapping puttees around [0]'s legs, and puttees repeatedly fell down around [0]'s ankles.After the First World War, [0] took an interest in creative writing. In June 1919, [0] became a founding editor and business manager of the Henley Telegraph and Cable Company's in-house publication, The Henley Telegraph (sixpence a copy), to which [0] submitted several short stories. the Henley Telegraph and Cable Company's promoted [0] to the advertising department, where [0] wrote copy and drew graphics for electric cable advertisements. [0] enjoyed the job and would stay late at the office to examine the proofs; [0] told biographer Patrick McGilligan that stay was [0]'s \"first step toward cinema\". [0] enjoyed watching films, especially American cinema, and from the age of 16 read the trade papers; [0] watched Charlie Chaplin, D. W. Griffith and Buster Keaton, and particularly liked Fritz Lang's Der m\u00fcde Tod (1921).", "Inter-war career: 1919\u20131939": "[0] is our person to focus on. While still at Henley's, [0] read in a trade paper that Famous Players\u2013Lasky, the production arm of Paramount Pictures, was opening a studio in London. Famous Players\u2013Lasky, the production arm of Paramount Pictures, were planning to film The Sorrows of Satan by Marie Corelli, so [0] produced some drawings for the title cards and sent some drawings for the title cards to a studio in London. a studio in London hired [0], and in 1919 [0] began working for Islington Studios in Poole Street, Hoxton, as a title-card designer.Donald Spoto wrote that most of the staff were Americans with strict job specifications, but the English workers were encouraged to try the English workers's hand at anything, which meant that [0] gained experience as a co-writer, art director and production manager on at least 18 silent films. The Times wrote in February 1922 about Islington Studios in Poole Street, Hoxton,'s \"special art title department under the supervision of [0]\". [0]'s work included Number 13 (1922), also known as Mrs. Peabody; Number 13 (1922), also known as Mrs. Peabody was cancelled because of financial problems - the few finished scenes are lost \u2014 and Always Tell Your Wife (1923), which [0] and Seymour Hicks finished together when Seymour Hicks was about to give up on it. Seymour Hicks wrote later about being helped by \"[0][0].When Paramount Pictures pulled out of London in 1922, [0] was hired as an assistant director by a new firm run in the same location by Michael Balcon, later known as Gainsborough Pictures. [0] worked on Woman to Woman (1923) with the director Graham Cutts, designing the set, writing the script and producing. [0] said: \"Woman to Woman (1923) was the first film that [0] had really got [0]'s hands onto.\" The editor and \"script girl\" on Woman to Woman (1923) was Alma Reville, [0]'s future wife. [0] also worked as an assistant to the director Graham Cutts on The White Shadow (1924), The Passionate Adventure (1924), The Blackguard (1925) and The Prude's Fall (1925). The Blackguard was produced at the Babelsberg Studios in Potsdam, where [0] watched part of the making of F. W. Murnau's's The Last Laugh (1924). [0] was impressed with F. W. Murnau's's work, and later used many of [0]'s techniques for the set design in [0]'s own productions.In the summer of 1925, Michael Balcon asked [0] to direct The Pleasure Garden (1925), starring Virginia Valli, a co-production of Gainsborough and the German firm Emelka at the Geiselgasteig studio near Munich. Reville, by then Hitchcock's fianc\u00e9e, was assistant director-editor. Although The Pleasure Garden (1925), starring Virginia Valli, a co-production of Gainsborough and the German firm Emelka at the Geiselgasteig studio near Munich was a commercial flop, Michael Balcon liked [0]'s work; a Daily Express headline called [0] the \"Young man with a master mind\". Production of The Pleasure Garden (1925), starring Virginia Valli, a co-production of Gainsborough and the German firm Emelka at the Geiselgasteig studio near Munich encountered obstacles which [0] would later learn from: on arrival to Brenner Pass, [0] failed to declare his film stock to customs and his film stock was confiscated; one actress could not enter the water for a scene because one actress was on one actress's period; budget overruns meant that [0] had to borrow money from the actors. [0] also needed a translator to give instructions to the cast and crew.In Germany, [0] observed the nuances of German cinema and filmmaking which had a big influence on [0]. When [0] was not working, [0] would visit Berlin's art galleries, concerts and museums. [0] would also meet with actors, writers and producers to build connections. Michael Balcon asked [0] to direct a second film in Munich, The Mountain Eagle (1926), based on an original story titled Fear o' God. a second film in Munich, The Mountain Eagle (1926), based on an original story titled Fear o' God is lost, and [0] called a second film in Munich, The Mountain Eagle (1926), based on an original story titled Fear o' God \"a very bad movie\". A year later, [0] wrote and directed The Ring; although the screenplay was credited solely to [0]'s name, Elliot Stannard assisted [0] with the writing. The Ring garnered positive reviews; the Bioscope critic called The Ring \"the most magnificent British film ever made\".When [0] returned to England, [0] was one of the early members of the London Film Society, newly formed in 1925. Through the London Film Society, newly formed in 1925, [0] became fascinated by the work by Soviet filmmakers: Dziga Vertov, Lev Kuleshov, Sergei Eisenstein and Vsevolod Pudovkin. [0] would also socialise with fellow English filmmakers Ivor Montagu, Adrian Brunel and Walter Mycroft.Visually, it was extraordinarily imaginative for the time, most notably in the scene in which [0] installed a glass floor so that [0] could show the lodger pacing up and down in the lodger's room from below, as though overheard by his landlady.\u2014 BFI entry for [0]'s first thriller, The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog ([0] established [0] as a name director with [0]'s first thriller, The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog (1927). The Pleasure Garden (1925), starring Virginia Valli, a co-production of Gainsborough and the German firm Emelka at the Geiselgasteig studio near Munich concerns the hunt for a Jack the Ripper-style serial killer who, wearing a black cloak and carrying a black bag, is murdering young blonde women in London, and only on Tuesdays. his landlady suspects that his landlady's is the killer, but the lodger turns out to be innocent. [0] had wanted the leading man to be guilty, or for The Pleasure Garden (1925), starring Virginia Valli, a co-production of Gainsborough and the German firm Emelka at the Geiselgasteig studio near Munich at least to end ambiguously, but the leading man was Ivor Novello, a matin\u00e9e idol, and the \"star system\" meant that Ivor Novello, a matin\u00e9e idol could not be the villain. [0] told Truffaut: \"Truffaut have to clearly spell it out in big letters: 'the lodger is innocent.'\" ([0] had the same problem years later with Cary Grant in Suspicion (1941).) Released in January 1927, The Pleasure Garden (1925), starring Virginia Valli, a co-production of Gainsborough and the German firm Emelka at the Geiselgasteig studio near Munich was a commercial and critical success in the UK. Upon The Pleasure Garden (1925), starring Virginia Valli, a co-production of Gainsborough and the German firm Emelka at the Geiselgasteig studio near Munich's release, the trade journal Bioscope wrote: \"It is possible that The Pleasure Garden (1925), starring Virginia Valli, a co-production of Gainsborough and the German firm Emelka at the Geiselgasteig studio near Munich is the finest British production ever made\". [0] told Truffaut that The Pleasure Garden (1925), starring Virginia Valli, a co-production of Gainsborough and the German firm Emelka at the Geiselgasteig studio near Munich was the first of [0] to be influenced by German Expressionism: \"In truth, you might almost say that The Pleasure Garden (1925), starring Virginia Valli, a co-production of Gainsborough and the German firm Emelka at the Geiselgasteig studio near Munich was [0]'s first picture.\" [0] made [0]'s first cameo appearance in The Pleasure Garden (1925), starring Virginia Valli, a co-production of Gainsborough and the German firm Emelka at the Geiselgasteig studio near Munich, sitting in a newsroom.On 2 December 1926, [0] married Reville, by then Hitchcock's fianc\u00e9e, at the Brompton Oratory in South Kensington. The couple honeymooned in Paris, Lake Como and St. Moritz, before returning to London to live in a leased flat on the top two floors of 153 Cromwell Road, Kensington. Reville, by then Hitchcock's fianc\u00e9e, converted from Protestantism to Catholicism, apparently at the insistence of [0]'s mother; Reville, by then Hitchcock's fianc\u00e9e, was baptised on 31 May 1927 and confirmed at Westminster Cathedral by Cardinal Francis Bourne on 5 June.In 1928, when The couple learned that Reville, by then Hitchcock's fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, The couple purchased \"Winter's Grace\", a Tudor farmhouse set in eleven acres on Stroud Lane, Shamley Green, Surrey, for \u00a32,500. Their daughter and only child, Patricia Alma Hitchcock, was born on 7 July that year. Their daughter and only child, Patricia Alma Hitchcock, died on 9 August 2021 at Reville, by then Hitchcock's fianc\u00e9e, became Reville, by then Hitchcock's fianc\u00e9e,'s closest collaborator; Charles Champlin wrote in 1982: \"The The couple touch had four hands, and two were Reville, by then Hitchcock's fianc\u00e9e,'s.\" When [0] accepted the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1979, [0] said that [0] wanted to mention \"four people who have given me the most affection, appreciation and encouragement, and constant collaboration. The first of four people who have given me the most affection, appreciation and encouragement, and constant collaboration is a film editor, the second is a scriptwriter, the third is Reville, by then Hitchcock's fianc\u00e9e,Their daughter and only child, Patricia Alma Hitchcock,, and the fourth is as fine a cook as ever performed miracles in a domestic kitchen. And four people who have given me the most affection, appreciation and encouragement, and constant collaboration's names are Reville, by then Hitchcock's fianc\u00e9e,.\" Reville, by then Hitchcock's fianc\u00e9e, wrote or co-wrote on many of [0]'s films, including Shadow of a Doubt, Suspicion and The 39 Steps.[0] began work on his tenth film, Blackmail (1929), when its production company, British International Pictures (BIP), converted its production company, British International Pictures (BIP),'s Elstree studios to sound. his tenth film, Blackmail (1929) was the first British \"talkie\"; converted followed the rapid development of sound films in the United States, from the use of brief sound segments in The Jazz Singer (1927) to the first full sound feature Lights of New York (1928). his tenth film, Blackmail (1929) began the [0] tradition of using famous landmarks as a backdrop for suspense sequences, with the climax taking place on the dome of the British Museum. his tenth film, Blackmail (1929) also features one of [0]'s longest cameo appearances, which shows [0] being bothered by a small boy as [0] reads a book on the London Underground. In the PBS series The Men Who Made The Movies, [0] explained how [0] used early sound recording as a special element of his tenth film, Blackmail (1929), stressing the word \"knife\" in a conversation with the woman suspected of murder.[clarification needed] During this period, [0] directed segments for a its production company, British International Pictures (BIP), revue, Elstree Calling (1930), and directed a short film, An Elastic Affair (1930), featuring two Film Weekly scholarship winners. An Elastic Affair is one of the lost films.In 1933, [0] signed a multi-film contract with Gaumont-British, once again working for Michael Balcon. [0]'s first film for Gaumont-British, The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934), was a success; his second, The 39 Steps (1935), was acclaimed in the UK, and gained [0] recognition in the United States. his second, The 39 Steps (1935), also established the quintessential English \"Hitchcock blonde\" (Madeleine Carroll) as the template for [0]'s succession of ice-cold, elegant leading ladies. Screenwriter Robert Towne remarked: \"It's not much of an exaggeration to say that all contemporary escapist entertainment begins with The 39 Steps\". John Buchan, author of The Thirty-Nine Steps on which the film is loosely based, met with [0] on set, and attended the high-profile premiere at the New Gallery Cinema in London. Upon viewing The 39 Steps, John Buchan, author of The Thirty-Nine Steps on which the film is loosely based said The 39 Steps had improved on The Thirty-Nine Steps on which the film is loosely based. The Pleasure Garden (1925), starring Virginia Valli, a co-production of Gainsborough and the German firm Emelka at the Geiselgasteig studio near Munich was one of the first to introduce the \"MacGuffin\" plot device, a term coined by the English screenwriter Angus MacPhail. The MacGuffin is an item or goal the protagonist is pursuing, one that otherwise has no narrative value; in The 39 Steps, The MacGuffin is a stolen set of design plans.[0] released two spy thrillers in 1936. Sabotage was loosely based on Joseph Conrad's novel, The Secret Agent (1907), about a woman who discovers that her husband is a terrorista woman who discovers that her husband is a terrorist's , and Secret Agent, based on two stories in Ashenden: Or the British Agent (1928) by W. Somerset Maugham.At this time, [0] also became notorious for pranks against the cast and crew. pranks against the cast and crew ranged from simple and innocent to crazy and maniacal. For instance, [0] hosted a dinner party where [0] dyed all the food blue because [0] claimed there weren't enough blue foods. [0] also had a horse delivered to the dressing room of [0]'s friend, actor Gerald du Maurier.[0] followed up with Young and Innocent in 1937, a crime thriller based on the 1936 novel A Shilling for Candles by Josephine Tey. Starring Nova Pilbeam and Derrick De Marney, Young and Innocent was relatively enjoyable for the cast and crew to make. To meet distribution purposes in the United States, Young and Innocent's runtime was cut and cut included removal of one of [0]'s favourite scenes: a children's tea party which becomes menacing to the protagonists.[0]'s next major success was The Lady Vanishes (1938), \"one of the greatest train movies from the genre's golden era\", according to Philip French, in which Miss Froy (May Whitty), a British spy posing as a governess, disappears on a train journey through the fictional European country of Bandrika. The Pleasure Garden (1925), starring Virginia Valli, a co-production of Gainsborough and the German firm Emelka at the Geiselgasteig studio near Munich saw [0] receive the 1938 New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Director. Benjamin Crisler of The Times wrote in June 1938: \"Three unique and valuable institutions the British have that we in the United States have not: Magna Carta, the Tower Bridge and [0].\" The Pleasure Garden (1925), starring Virginia Valli, a co-production of Gainsborough and the German firm Emelka at the Geiselgasteig studio near Munich was based on the novel The Wheel Spins (1936) written by Ethel Lina White.By 1938, [0] was aware that [0] had reached [0]'s peak in Britain. [0] had received numerous offers from producers in the United States, but [0] turned numerous offers from producers in the United States down because [0] disliked the contractual obligations or thought the projects were repellent. However, producer David O. Selznick offered [0] a concrete proposal to make a film based on the sinking of RMS\u00a0Titanic, which was eventually shelved, but producer David O. Selznick persuaded [0] to come to Hollywood. In July 1938, [0] flew to New York, and found that [0] was already a celebrity; [0] was featured in magazines and gave interviews to radio stations. In Hollywood, [0] met producer David O. Selznick for the first time. producer David O. Selznick offered [0] a four-film contract, approximately $40,000 for each picture (equivalent to $830,000 in 2022).", "Early Hollywood years: 1939\u20131945": "[0] is our person to focus on. Selznick signed [0] to a seven-year contract beginning in April 1939, and the Hitchcocks moved to Hollywood. the Hitchcocks lived in a spacious flat on Wilshire Boulevard, and slowly acclimatised the Hitchcocks to the Los Angeles area. He and his wife Alma kept a low profile, and were not interested in attending parties or being celebrities. [0] discovered [0]'s taste for fine food in West Hollywood, but still carried on [0]'s way of life from England. [0] was impressed with Hollywood's filmmaking culture, expansive budgets and efficiency, compared to the limits that [0] had often faced in England. In June 1939, Life called [0] the \"greatest master of melodrama in screen history\".Although He and his wife Alma respected each other, He and his wife Alma's working arrangements were sometimes difficult. Selznick suffered from constant financial problems, and [0] was often unhappy about Selznick's creative control and interference over Selznick's films. Selznick was also displeased with [0]'s method of shooting just what was in the script, and nothing more, which meant that the film could not be cut and remade differently at a later time. As well as complaining about [0]'s \"goddamn jigsaw cutting\", He and his wife Alma's personalities were mismatched: [0] was reserved whereas Selznick was flamboyant. Eventually, Selznick generously lent [0] to the larger film studios. Selznick made only a few films each year, as did fellow independent producer Samuel Goldwyn, so Selznick did not always have projects for [0] to direct. fellow independent producer Samuel Goldwyn had also negotiated with [0] on a possible contract, only to be outbid by Selznick. In a later interview, [0] said: \"[Selznick] was the Big Producer.\u00a0... Producer was king. The most flattering thing Mr. Selznick ever said about me\u2014and The most flattering thing Mr. Selznick ever said about me shows you the amount of control\u2014Selznick said [0] was the 'only director' Selznick'd 'trust with a film'.[0] approached American cinema cautiously; [0]'s first American film was set in England in which the \"Americanness\" of the characters was incidental: Rebecca (1940) was set in a Hollywood version of England's Cornwall and based on a novel by English novelist Daphne du Maurier. Selznick insisted on a faithful adaptation of a novel by English novelist Daphne du Maurier, and disagreed with [0] with the use of humour. Rebecca (1940) concerns an unnamed na\u00efve young woman who marries a widowed aristocrat. an unnamed na\u00efve young woman who marries a widowed aristocrat lives in a widowed aristocrat's large English country house, and struggles with the lingering reputation of a widowed aristocrat's elegant and worldly first wife Rebecca, who died under mysterious circumstances. Rebecca (1940) won Best Picture at the 13th Academy Awards; the statuette was given to Selznick. [0] received [0]'s first nomination for Best Director, [0]'s first of five such nominations.[0]'s second American film was the thriller Foreign Correspondent (1940), set in Europe, based on Vincent Sheean's book Personal History (1935) and produced by Walter Wanger. the thriller Foreign Correspondent (1940), set in Europe, based on Vincent Sheean's book Personal History (1935) and produced by Walter Wanger was nominated for Best Picture 1940. [0] felt uneasy living and working in Hollywood while England was at war; [0]'s concern resulted in the thriller Foreign Correspondent (1940), set in Europe, based on Vincent Sheean's book Personal History (1935) and produced by Walter Wanger. Filmed in 1939, the thriller Foreign Correspondent (1940), set in Europe, based on Vincent Sheean's book Personal History (1935) and produced by Walter Wanger was inspired by the rapidly changing events in Europe, as covered by an American newspaper reporter played by Joel McCrea. By mixing footage of European scenes with scenes filmed on a Hollywood backlot, the thriller Foreign Correspondent (1940), set in Europe, based on Vincent Sheean's book Personal History (1935) and produced by Walter Wanger avoided direct references to Nazism, Nazi Germany and Germans, to comply with the Motion Picture Production Code at the time.[failed verification]In September 1940, the Hitchcocks bought the 200-acre (0.81\u00a0km2) Cornwall Ranch near Scotts Valley, California, in the Santa Cruz Mountains. the Hitchcocks's primary residence was an English-style home in Bel Air, purchased in 1942. [0]'s films were diverse during this period, ranging from the romantic comedy Mr. & Mrs. Smith (1941) to the bleak film noir Shadow of a Doubt (1943).Suspicion (1941) marked [0]'s first film as a producer and director. the bleak film noir Shadow of a Doubt (1943).Suspicion (1941) is set in England; [0] used the north coast of Santa Cruz for the English coastline sequence. the bleak film noir Shadow of a Doubt (1943).Suspicion (1941) is the first of four in which Cary Grant was cast by [0], and the bleak film noir Shadow of a Doubt (1943).Suspicion (1941) is one of the rare occasions that Cary Grant plays a sinister character. Cary Grant plays Johnnie Aysgarth, an English conman whose actions raise suspicion and anxiety in his shy young English wife, Lina McLaidlaw (Joan Fontaine)Johnnie Aysgarth, an English conman whose actions raise suspicion and anxiety in his shy young English wife, Lina McLaidlaw (Joan Fontaine)'s . In one scene, [0] placed a light inside a glass of milk, perhaps poisoned, that Grant is bringing to his wife; a light ensures that the audience's attention is on a glass of milk, perhaps poisoned, that Grant is bringing to his wife. Johnnie Aysgarth, an English conman whose actions raise suspicion and anxiety in his shy young English wife, Lina McLaidlaw (Joan Fontaine) is actually a killer, as per written in the book, Before the Fact by Francis Iles, but the studio felt that Cary Grant's image would be tarnished by is. [0] therefore settled for an ambiguous finale, although [0] would have preferred to end with his shy young English wife, Lina McLaidlaw (Joan Fontaine)'s murder. Joan Fontaine won Best Actress for Joan Fontaine's performance.Saboteur (1942) is the first of two films that [0] made for the studio during the decade. [0] wanted Gary Cooper and Barbara Stanwyck or Henry Fonda and Gene Tierney to star, but was forced by Universal to use Universal contract player Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane, a freelancer who signed a one-picture deal with Universal, both known for their work in comedies and light dramas. The story depicts a confrontation between a suspected saboteur (Universal contract player Robert Cummings) and a real saboteur (Norman Lloyd) atop the Statue of Liberty. [0] took a three-day tour of New York City to scout for Saboteur (1942)'s filming locations. [0] also directed Have You Heard? (1942), a photographic dramatisation for Life magazine of the dangers of rumours during wartime. In 1943, [0] wrote a mystery story for Look, \"The Murder of Monty Woolley\", a sequence of captioned photographs inviting the reader to find clues to the murderer's identity; [0] cast the performers as the performers, such as Monty Woolley, Doris Merrick and make-up man Guy Pearce.[citation needed]Back in England, Hitchcock's mother Emma was severely ill; Hitchcock's mother Emma died on 26 September 1942 at age 79. [0] never spoke publicly about Hitchcock's mother Emma, but [0]'s assistant said that [0] admired Hitchcock's mother Emma. Four months later, on 4 January 1943, his brother William died of an overdose at age 52. [0] was not very close to his brother William, but his brother William's made [0] conscious about [0]'s own eating and drinking habits. [0] was overweight and suffering from back aches. [0]'s New Year's resolution in 1943 was to take [0]'s diet seriously with the help of a physician. In January 1943, Shadow of a Doubt was released, which [0] had fond memories of making. In Shadow of a Doubt, Charlotte \"Charlie\" Newton (Teresa Wright) suspects Charlotte \"Charlie\" Newton (Teresa Wright)'s beloved uncle Charlie Oakley (Joseph Cotten) of being a serial killer. [0] filmed extensively on location, this time in the Northern California city of Santa Rosa.At 20th Century Fox, [0] approached John Steinbeck with an idea for a film, which recorded the experiences of the survivors of a German U-boat attack. John Steinbeck began work on the script for what would become Lifeboat (1944). However, John Steinbeck was unhappy with Lifeboat (1944) and asked that John Steinbeck's name be removed from the credits, to no avail. an idea for a film, which recorded the experiences of the survivors of a German U-boat attack was rewritten as a short story by Harry Sylvester and published in Collier's in 1943. The action sequences were shot in a small boat in the studio water tank. The locale posed problems for [0]'s traditional cameo appearance; it was solved by having [0]'s image appear in a newspaper that William Bendix is reading in a small boat in the studio water tank, showing [0] in a before-and-after advertisement for \"Reduco-Obesity Slayer\". [0] told Truffaut in 1962:At the time, [0] was on a strenuous diet, painfully working [0]'s way from three hundred to two hundred pounds. So [0] decided to immortalize my loss and get [0]'s bit part by posing for \"before\" and \"after\" pictures.\u00a0... [0] was literally submerged by letters from fat people who wanted to know where and how they could get Reducofat people who wanted to know where and how they could get Reduco . [0]'s typical dinner before my loss had been a roast chicken, boiled ham, potatoes, bread, vegetables, relishes, salad, dessert, a bottle of wine and some brandy. To lose weight, a strenuous diet consisted of black coffee for breakfast and lunch, and steak and salad for dinner, but a strenuous diet was hard to maintain; Donald Spoto wrote that [0]'s weight fluctuated considerably over the next 40 years. At the end of 1943, despite my loss, the Occidental Insurance Company of Los Angeles refused [0]'s application for life insurance.[0] felt the need to make a little contribution to the war effort, and [0] was both overweight and over-age for military service. [0] knew that if [0] did nothing, [0]'d regret did for the rest of [0]'s life\u2014 [0] ([0] returned to the UK for an extended visit in late 1943 and early 1944. While there [0] made two short propaganda films, Bon Voyage (1944) and Aventure Malgache (1944), for the Ministry of Information. In June and July 1945, [0] served as \"treatment advisor\" on a Holocaust documentary that used Allied Forces footage of the liberation of Nazi concentration camps. a Holocaust documentary that used Allied Forces footage of the liberation of Nazi concentration camps was assembled in London and produced by Sidney Bernstein of the Ministry of Information, who brought Hitchcock (a friend of his) on boardSidney Bernstein of the Ministry of Information, who brought Hitchcock (a friend of his) on board. a Holocaust documentary that used Allied Forces footage of the liberation of Nazi concentration camps was originally intended to be broadcast to the Germans, but the British government deemed a Holocaust documentary that used Allied Forces footage of the liberation of Nazi concentration camps too traumatic to be shown to a shocked post-war population. Instead, a Holocaust documentary that used Allied Forces footage of the liberation of Nazi concentration camps was transferred in 1952 from the British War Office film vaults to London's Imperial War Museum and remained unreleased until 1985, when an edited version was broadcast as an episode of PBS Frontline, under the title London's Imperial War Museum had given a Holocaust documentary that used Allied Forces footage of the liberation of Nazi concentration camps: Memory of the Camps. The full-length version of the film, German Concentration Camps Factual Survey, was restored in 2014 by scholars at London's Imperial War Museum.", "Post-war Hollywood years: 1945\u20131953": "[0] is our person to focus on.

Gregory Peck plays amnesiac Dr. Anthony Edwardes under the treatment of analyst Dr. Peterson (Ingrid Bergman), who falls in love with amnesiac Dr. Anthony Edwardes while trying to unlock amnesiac Dr. Anthony Edwardes's repressed past. Two point-of-view shots were achieved by building a large wooden hand (which would appear to belong to the character whose point of view the camera took) and out-sized props for a large wooden hand to hold: a bucket-sized glass of milk and a large wooden gun. For added novelty and impact, the climactic gunshot was hand-coloured red on some copies of Spellbound (1945), which explores psychoanalysis and features a dream sequence designed by Salvador Dal\u00ed.

[0] told Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut that David Selznick sold [0], Ingrid Bergman, Cary Grant and Ben Hecht's's screenplay, to RKO Radio Pictures as a \"package\" for $500,000 (equivalent to $7.5\u00a0million in 2022) because of cost overruns on David Selznick's Duel in the Sun (1946).[citation needed] Notorious stars Ingrid Bergman and Cary Grant, both [0] collaborators, and features a plot about Nazis, uranium and South America. [0]'s prescient use of uranium as a plot device led to [0] being briefly placed under surveillance by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. According to Patrick McGilligan, in or around March 1945, [0] and Ben Hecht's consulted Robert Millikan of the California Institute of Technology about the development of a uranium bomb. David Selznick complained that the notion was \"science fiction\", only to be confronted by the news of the detonation of two atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan in August [0] formed an independent production company, Transatlantic Pictures, with [0]'s friend Sidney Bernstein. [0] made two films with an independent production company, Transatlantic Pictures,, one of which was [0]'s first colour film. With Rope (1948), [0] experimented with marshalling suspense in a confined environment, as [0] had done earlier with Lifeboat. Rope (1948) appears as a very limited number of continuous shots, but Rope (1948) was actually shot in 10 ranging from 4+1\u20442 to 10 minutes each; a 10-minute length of film was the most that a camera's film magazine could hold at the time. Some transitions between reels were hidden by having a dark object fill the entire screen for a moment. [0] used those points to hide the cut, and began the next take with the camera in the same place. Rope (1948) features James Stewart in the leading role, and was the first of four films that James Stewart made with [0]. Rope (1948) was inspired by the Leopold and Loeb case of the 1920s. Critical response at the time was mixed.Under Capricorn (1949), set in 19th-century Australia, also uses the short-lived technique of long takes, but to a more limited extent. [0] again used Technicolor in Under Capricorn (1949), set in 19th-century Australia,, then returned to black-and-white for several years. an independent production company, Transatlantic Pictures, became inactive after two films. [0] filmed Stage Fright (1950) at Elstree Studios in England, where [0] had worked during [0]'s British International Pictures contract many years before. [0] paired one of British International Pictures's most popular stars, Jane Wyman, with the expatriate German actor Marlene Dietrich and used several prominent British actors, including Michael Wilding, Richard Todd and Alastair Sim. Stage Fright (1950) was [0]'s first proper production for British International PicturesRope (1948) Under Capricorn (1949), set in 19th-century Australia,, because an independent production company, Transatlantic Pictures, was experiencing financial difficulties.His thriller Strangers on a Train (1951) was based on the novel of the same name by Patricia Highsmith. [0] combined many elements from [0]'s preceding films. [0] approached Dashiell Hammett to write the dialogue, but Raymond Chandler took over, then left over disagreements with [0]. In His thriller Strangers on a Train (1951), two men casually meet, one of whom speculates on a foolproof method to murder; one of whom suggests that two people, each wishing to do away with someone, should each perform the other's murder. Farley Granger's role was as the innocent victim of the scheme, while Robert Walker, previously known for \"boy-next-door\" roles, played the villain. I Confess (1953) was set in Quebec with Montgomery Clift as a Catholic priest.", "Peak years: 1954\u20131964": "Alfred Hitchcock is our person to focus on. I Confess was followed by three colour films starring Grace Kelly: [0], Rear Window (1954) and To Catch a Thief (1955).

Alfred Hitchcock experimented with 3D cinematography for [0].Alfred Hitchcock moved to Paramount Pictures and filmed Rear Window (1954), starring James Stewart and Grace Kelly, as well as Thelma Ritter and Raymond Burr. Stewart's character is a photographer named Jeff (based on Robert Capa) who must temporarily use a wheelchair. Out of boredom, Stewart's character begins observing his neighbours across the courtyard, then becomes convinced that one of them (Raymond Burr) has murdered his unfaithful wife (Kelly). Stewart's character eventually manages to convince Stewart's character's policeman buddy (Wendell Corey) and his unfaithful wife (Kelly). As with Lifeboat and Rope, the principal characters are depicted in confined or cramped quarters, in this case James Stewart's studio apartment. Alfred Hitchcock uses close-ups of Stewart's face to show Stewart's character's reactions, \"from the comic voyeurism directed at Stewart's character's neighbours to Stewart's character's helpless terror watching Grace Kelly and Raymond Burr in one of them (Raymond Burr)'s apartment\".From 1955 to 1965, Alfred Hitchcock was the host of the television series Alfred Hitchcock Presents. With Alfred Hitchcock's droll delivery, gallows humour and iconic image, the television series Alfred Hitchcock Presents made Alfred Hitchcock a celebrity. The title-sequence of the television series Alfred Hitchcock Presents pictured a minimalist caricature of his profile (Alfred Hitchcock drew a minimalist caricature of his profile Alfred Hitchcock; a minimalist caricature of his profile is composed of only nine strokes), which Alfred Hitchcock's real silhouette then filled. The series theme tune was Funeral March of a Marionette by the French composer Charles Gounod (1818\u20131893).His introductions always included some sort of wry humour, such as the description of a recent multi-person execution hampered by having only one electric chair, while two are shown with a sign \"Two chairs\u2014no waiting!\" Alfred Hitchcock directed 18 episodes of the television series Alfred Hitchcock Presents. the television series Alfred Hitchcock Presents became The Alfred Hitchcock Hour in 1962, and NBC broadcast the final episode on 10 May 1965. In the 1980s, a new version of the television series Alfred Hitchcock Presents was produced for television, making use of Alfred Hitchcock's original introductions in a colourised form.Alfred Hitchcock's success in television spawned a set of short-story collections in his name; a set of short-story collections in his name included Alfred Hitchcock's Anthology, Stories They Wouldn't Let Me Do on TV, and Tales Me's Mother Never Told Me. In 1956, HSD Publications also licensed his name to create Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine, a monthly digest specialising in crime and detective fiction. Alfred Hitchcock's television series were very profitable, and Alfred Hitchcock's foreign-language versions of books were bringing revenues of up to $100,000 a year (equivalent to $990,000 in 2022).In 1955, Alfred Hitchcock became a United States citizen. In 1955, his third Grace Kelly film, To Catch a Thief, was released; his third Grace Kelly film, To Catch a Thief, is set in the French Riviera, and stars Grace Kelly and Cary Grant. Cary Grant plays retired thief John Robie, who becomes the prime suspect for a spate of robberies in the Riviera. A thrill-seeking American heiress played by Grace Kelly surmises retired thief John Robie, who becomes the prime suspect for a spate of robberies in the Riviera's true identity and tries to seduce retired thief John Robie, who becomes the prime suspect for a spate of robberies in the Riviera. \"Despite the obvious age disparity between James Stewart and Grace Kelly and a lightweight plot, the witty script (loaded with double entendres) and the good-natured acting proved a commercial success.\" his third Grace Kelly film, To Catch a Thief, was Alfred Hitchcock's last film with Grace Kelly; Grace Kelly married Prince Rainier of Monaco in 1956, and ended Grace Kelly's film career afterward. Alfred Hitchcock then remade his own 1934 film The Man Who Knew Too Much in 1956. This time, This time starred James Stewart and Doris Day, who sang the theme song \"Que Sera, Sera\", which won the Academy Award for Best Original Song and became a big hit. They play a couple whose son is kidnapped to prevent them from interfering with an assassinationa couple whose son is kidnapped to prevent them from interfering with an assassination . As in his own 1934 film The Man Who Knew Too Much, the climax takes place at the Royal Albert Hall.The Wrong Man (1956), Alfred Hitchcock's final film for Warner Bros., is a low-key black-and-white production based on a real-life case of mistaken identity reported in Life magazine in 1953. The Wrong Man (1956) was the only film of Alfred Hitchcock to star Henry Fonda, playing a Stork Club musician mistaken for a liquor store thief, who is arrested and tried for robbery while his wife (Vera Miles) emotionally collapses under the straina Stork Club musician mistaken for a liquor store thief, who is arrested and tried for robbery while his wife (Vera Miles) emotionally collapses under the strain's . Alfred Hitchcock told Truffaut that Alfred Hitchcock's lifelong fear of the police attracted Alfred Hitchcock to the subject and was embedded in many scenes. While directing episodes for the television series Alfred Hitchcock Presents during the summer of 1957, Alfred Hitchcock was admitted to hospital for hernia and gallstones, and had to have Alfred Hitchcock's gallbladder removed. Following a successful surgery, Alfred Hitchcock immediately returned to work to prepare for Alfred Hitchcock's next project. Vertigo (1958) again starred James Stewart, with Kim Novak and Barbara Bel Geddes. Alfred Hitchcock had wanted Vera Miles to play the lead, but Vera Miles was pregnant. Alfred Hitchcock told Oriana Fallaci: \"Alfred Hitchcock was offering Vera Miles a big part, the chance to become a beautiful sophisticated blonde, a real actress. We'd have spent a heap of dollars on a big part, the chance to become a beautiful sophisticated blonde, a real actress, and Vera Miles has the bad taste to get pregnant. Alfred Hitchcock hate pregnant women, because then pregnant women have children.\"In Vertigo (1958), James Stewart plays Scottie, a former police investigator suffering from acrophobia, who becomes obsessed with a woman he has been hired to shadow (Novak)Scottie, a former police investigator suffering from acrophobia, who becomes obsessed with a woman he has been hired to shadow (Novak) . Scottie, a former police investigator suffering from acrophobia, who becomes obsessed with a woman he has been hired to shadow (Novak)'s obsession leads to tragedy, and this time Alfred Hitchcock did not opt for a happy ending. Some critics, including Donald Spoto and Roger Ebert, agree that Vertigo (1958) is Alfred Hitchcock's most personal and revealing film, dealing with the Pygmalion-like obsessions of Scottie, a former police investigator suffering from acrophobia, who becomes obsessed with a woman he has been hired to shadow (Novak)Scottie, a former police investigator suffering from acrophobia, who becomes obsessed with a woman he has been hired to shadow (Novak) . Vertigo (1958) explores more frankly and at greater length Alfred Hitchcock's interest in the relation between sex and death, than any other work in Alfred Hitchcock's filmography.Vertigo (1958) contains a camera technique developed by Irmin Roberts, commonly referred to as a dolly zoom, which has been copied by many filmmakers. Vertigo (1958) premiered at the San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival, and Alfred Hitchcock won the Silver Seashell prize. Vertigo (1958) is considered a classic, but Vertigo (1958) attracted mixed reviews and poor box-office receipts at the time; the critic from Variety opined that Vertigo (1958) was \"too slow and too long\". Bosley Crowther of the New York Times thought Vertigo (1958) was \"devilishly far-fetched\", but praised the cast performances and Alfred Hitchcock's direction. Vertigo (1958) was also the last collaboration between James Stewart and Alfred Hitchcock. In the 2002 Sight & Sound polls, Vertigo (1958) ranked just behind Citizen Kane (1941); ten years later, in Sight & Sound, critics chose Vertigo (1958) as the best film ever made.After Vertigo (1958), the rest of 1958 was a difficult year for Alfred Hitchcock. During pre-production of North by Northwest (1959), which was a \"slow\" and \"agonising\" process, his unfaithful wife (Kelly) was diagnosed with cancer. While his unfaithful wife (Kelly) was in hospital, Alfred Hitchcock kept Alfred Hitchcock occupied with Alfred Hitchcock's television work and would visit his unfaithful wife (Kelly) every day. his unfaithful wife (Kelly) underwent surgery and made a full recovery, but made caused Alfred Hitchcock to imagine, for the first time, life without his unfaithful wife (Kelly).Alfred Hitchcock followed up with three more successful films, which are also recognised as among Alfred Hitchcock's best: North by Northwest (1959), Psycho (1960) and The Birds (1963). In North by Northwest (1959), Cary Grant portrays Roger Thornhill, a Madison Avenue advertising executive who is mistaken for a government secret agent. Roger Thornhill, a Madison Avenue advertising executive who is mistaken for a government secret agent is pursued across the United States by enemy agents, including Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint). At first, Roger Thornhill, a Madison Avenue advertising executive who is mistaken for a government secret agent believes Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) is helping Roger Thornhill, a Madison Avenue advertising executive who is mistaken for a government secret agent, but then realises that Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) is an enemy agent; Roger Thornhill, a Madison Avenue advertising executive who is mistaken for a government secret agent later learns that Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) is working undercover for the CIA. During North by Northwest (1959)'s opening two-week run at Radio City Music Hall, North by Northwest (1959) grossed $404,056 (equivalent to $4.1\u00a0million in 2022), setting a non-holiday gross record for Radio City Music Hall. Time magazine called North by Northwest (1959) \"smoothly troweled and thoroughly entertaining\".Psycho (1960 is arguably Alfred Hitchcock's best-known film. Based on Robert Bloch's 1959 novel Psycho, which was inspired by the case of Ed Gein, Psycho (1960 was produced on a tight budget of $800,000 (equivalent to $7.9\u00a0million in 2022) and shot in black-and-white on a spare set using crew members from the television series Alfred Hitchcock Presents. The unprecedented violence of the shower scene, the early death of the heroine, and the innocent lives extinguished by a disturbed murderer became the hallmarks of a new horror-film genre. Psycho (1960 proved popular with audiences, with lines stretching outside theatres as viewers waited for the next showing. Psycho (1960 broke box-office records in the United Kingdom, France, South America, the United States and Canada, and was a moderate success in Australia for a brief period.[page\u00a0needed]Psycho was the most profitable of Alfred Hitchcock's career, and Alfred Hitchcock personally earned in excess of $15\u00a0million (equivalent to $150\u00a0million in 2022). Alfred Hitchcock subsequently swapped Alfred Hitchcock's rights to Psycho (1960 and Alfred Hitchcock's TV anthology for 150,000 shares of MCA, making Alfred Hitchcock the third largest shareholder and Alfred Hitchcock's own boss at Paramount Pictures, in theory at least, although swapped did not stop studio interference.[page\u00a0needed] Following Psycho (1960, Psycho (1960 became an American horror franchise: Psycho II, Psycho III, Bates Motel, Psycho IV: The Beginning and a colour 1998 remake of Psycho (1960.On 13 August 1962, Alfred Hitchcock's 63rd birthday, Truffaut began a 50-hour interview of Hitchcock, filmed over eight days at Universal Studios, during which Hitchcock agreed to answer 500 questions. It took four years to transcribe the tapes and organise the images; a 50-hour interview of Hitchcock, filmed over eight days at Universal Studios, during which Hitchcock agreed to answer 500 questions was published as a book in 1967, which Truffaut nicknamed the \"Hitchbook\". The audio tapes were used as the basis of a documentary in 2015. Truffaut sought a 50-hour interview of Hitchcock, filmed over eight days at Universal Studios, during which Hitchcock agreed to answer 500 questions because it was clear to Truffaut that Alfred Hitchcock was not simply the mass-market entertainer the American media made Alfred Hitchcock out to be. It was obvious from Alfred Hitchcock's films, Truffaut wrote, that Alfred Hitchcock had \"given more thought to the potential of Alfred Hitchcock's art than any of Alfred Hitchcock's colleagues\". Truffaut compared a 50-hour interview of Hitchcock, filmed over eight days at Universal Studios, during which Hitchcock agreed to answer 500 questions to \"Oedipus' consultation of the oracle\".The film scholar Peter William Evans wrote that The Birds (1963) and Marnie (1964) are regarded as \"undisputed masterpieces\". Alfred Hitchcock had intended to film Marnie (1964) first, and in March 1962 it was announced that Grace Kelly would come out of retirement to star in Marnie (1964). When Grace Kelly asked Alfred Hitchcock to postpone Marnie (1964) until 1963 or 1964, Alfred Hitchcock recruited Evan Hunter, author of The Blackboard Jungle (1954), to develop a screenplay based on a Daphne du Maurier short story, \"The Birds\" (1952), which Alfred Hitchcock had republished in Alfred Hitchcock's My Favorites in Suspense (1959). Alfred Hitchcock hired Vera Miles to play the lead. the lead was Vera Miles's first role; Vera Miles had been a model in New York when Alfred Hitchcock saw Vera Miles, in October 1961, in an NBC television advert for Sego, a diet drink: \"Alfred Hitchcock signed Vera Miles because Vera Miles is a classic beauty. Movies don't have a classic beauty any more. Grace Kelly was the last.\" Alfred Hitchcock insisted, without explanation, that Vera Miles's first name be written in single quotation marks: 'Tippi'.In The Birds, Melanie Daniels, a young socialite, meets lawyer Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor) in a bird shop; Jessica Tandy plays lawyer Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor)'s possessive mother. Vera Miles visits lawyer Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor) in Bodega Bay (where The Birds was filmed) carrying a pair of lovebirds as a gift. Suddenly waves of birds start gathering, watching, and attacking. The question: \"What do the birds want?\" is left unanswered. Alfred Hitchcock made The Birds with equipment from the Revue Studio, which made the television series Alfred Hitchcock Presents. Alfred Hitchcock said The Birds was Alfred Hitchcock's most technically challenging film, using a combination of trained and mechanical birds against a backdrop of wild ones. Every shot was sketched in advance.An HBO/BBC television film, The Girl (2012), depicted Vera Miles's experiences on set; Vera Miles said that Alfred Hitchcock became obsessed with Vera Miles and sexually harassed Vera Miles. Alfred Hitchcock reportedly isolated Vera Miles from the rest of the crew, had Vera Miles followed, whispered obscenities to Vera Miles, had Vera Miles's handwriting analysed and had a ramp built from Alfred Hitchcock's private office directly into Vera Miles's trailer. Diane Baker, her co-star in Marnie, said: \"othing could have been more horrible for Diane Baker, her co-star in Marnie, than to arrive on set and to see Vera Miles being treated the way Vera Miles was.\" While filming the attack scene in the attic \u2014 which took a week to film \u2014 Vera Miles was placed in a caged room while two men wearing elbow-length protective gloves threw live birds at Vera Miles. Toward the end of the week, to stop the birds' flying away from Vera Miles too soon, one leg of each bird was attached by nylon thread to elastic bands sewn inside Vera Miles's clothes. Vera Miles broke down after a bird cut Vera Miles lower eyelid, and filming was halted on doctor's orders.In June 1962, Grace Kelly announced that Grace Kelly had decided against appearing in Vertigo (1958). Vera Miles had signed an exclusive seven-year, $500-a-week contract with Alfred Hitchcock in October 1961, and Alfred Hitchcock decided to cast Vera Miles in the lead role opposite Sean Connery. In 2016, describing Vera Miles's performance as \"one of the greatest in the history of cinema\", Richard Brody called Psycho (1960 a \"story of sexual violence\" inflicted on Vera MilesVera Miles: \"Psycho (1960 is, to put it simply, sick, and Psycho (1960's so because Alfred Hitchcock was sick. Alfred Hitchcock suffered all Alfred Hitchcock's life from furious sexual desire, suffered from the lack of furious sexual desire's gratification, suffered from the inability to transform fantasy into reality, and then went ahead and did so virtually, by way of Alfred Hitchcock's art.\" A 1964 the New York Times review called Psycho (1960 Alfred Hitchcock's \"most disappointing film in years\", citing Vera Miles's and Connery's lack of experience, an amateurish script and \"glaringly fake cardboard backdrops\".In Psycho (1960, Vera Miles Vera Milessteals $10,000 from Vera Miles's employer and goes on the run. Vera Miles applies for a job at Mark Rutland's (Connery) company in Philadelphia and steals from there too. Earlier, Vera Miles is shown having a panic attack during a thunderstorm and fearing the colour red. Mark Rutland's (Connery) tracks Vera Miles down and blackmails Vera Miles into marrying Mark Rutland's (Connery). Vera Miles explains that Vera Miles does not want to be touched, but during the \"honeymoon\", Mark Rutland's (Connery) rapes Vera Miles. Vera Miles and Mark Rutland's (Connery) discover that Marnie's mother had been a prostitute when Vera Miles was a child, and that, while Marnie's mother was fighting with a client during a thunderstorm \u2014 Marnie's mother believed a client had tried to molest Vera Miles \u2014 Vera Miles had killed a client to save Marnie's mother. Cured of Vera Miles's fears when Vera Miles remembers what happened, Vera Miles decides to stay with Mark Rutland's (Connery).Alfred Hitchcock told cinematographer Robert Burks that the camera had to be placed as close as possible to Vera Miles when Alfred Hitchcock filmed Stewart's face. Evan Hunter, the screenwriter of The Birds who was writing Marnie too, explained to Alfred Hitchcock that, if Mark Rutland's (Connery) loved Vera Miles, Mark Rutland's (Connery) would comfort Vera Miles, not rape Vera Miles. Alfred Hitchcock reportedly replied: \"Evan Hunter, the screenwriter of The Birds who was writing Marnie too, when Mark Rutland's (Connery) sticks it in Vera Miles, Alfred Hitchcock want it right on Stewart's face!\" When Evan Hunter, the screenwriter of The Birds who was writing Marnie too submitted two versions of the script, one without the attack scene in the attic \u2014 which took a week to film, Alfred Hitchcock replaced Evan Hunter, the screenwriter of The Birds who was writing Marnie too with Jay Presson Allen.", "Later years: 1966\u20131980": "[0] is our person to focus on. Failing health reduced [0]'s output during the last two decades of his life. Biographer Stephen Rebello claimed Universal imposed two films on [0], Torn Curtain (1966) and Topaz (1969), the latter of which is based on a Leon Uris novel, partly set in Cuba. two films were spy thrillers with Cold War-related themes. Torn Curtain (1966) precipitated the bitter end of the twelve-year collaboration between [0] and composer Bernard Herrmann. [0] was unhappy with composer Bernard Herrmann's score and replaced composer Bernard Herrmann with John Addison, Jay Livingston and Ray Evans. Upon release, Torn Curtain (1966) was a box office disappointment, and the latter of which is based on a Leon Uris novel, partly set in Cuba was disliked by both critics and Universal.[0] returned to Britain to make his penultimate film, Frenzy (1972), based on the novel Goodbye Piccadilly, Farewell Leicester Square (1966). After two espionage films, the plot marked a return to the murder-thriller genre. Richard Blaney (Jon Finch), a volatile barman with a history of explosive anger, becomes the prime suspect in the investigation into the \"Necktie Murders\", which are actually committed by Richard Blaney (Jon Finch), a volatile barman with a history of explosive anger,'s friend Bob Rusk (Barry Foster). This time, [0] makes the victim and villain kindreds, rather than opposites, as in Strangers on a Train.In his penultimate film, Frenzy (1972), based on the novel Goodbye Piccadilly, Farewell Leicester Square (1966), [0] allowed nudity for the first time. Two scenes show naked women, one of whom is being raped and strangled; Donald Spoto called one of whom is being raped and strangled \"one of the most repellent examples of a detailed murder in the history of film\". Both actors, Barbara Leigh-Hunt and Anna Massey, refused to do Two scenes, so models were used instead. Biographers have noted that [0] had always pushed the limits of film censorship, often managing to fool Joseph Breen, the head of the Motion Picture Production Code. [0] would add subtle hints of improprieties forbidden by censorship until the mid-1960s. Yet, Patrick McGilligan wrote that Joseph Breen, the head of the Motion Picture Production Code and others often realised that [0] was inserting such material and were actually amused, as well as alarmed by [0]'s \"inescapable inferences\".Family Plot (1976) was [0]'s last film. Family Plot (1976) relates the escapades of \"Madam\" Blanche Tyler, played by Barbara Harris, a fraudulent spiritualist, and \"Madam\" Blanche Tyler, played by Barbara Harris, a fraudulent spiritualist,'s taxi-driver lover Bruce Dern, making a living from \"Madam\" Blanche Tyler, played by Barbara Harris, a fraudulent spiritualist,'s phony powers. While Family Plot (1976) was based on the Victor Canning novel The Rainbird Pattern (1972), the Victor Canning novel The Rainbird Pattern (1972)'s tone is more sinister. Screenwriter Ernest Lehman originally wrote Family Plot (1976), under the working title Deception, with a dark tone but was pushed to a lighter, more comical tone by [0] where Family Plot (1976) took the name Deceit, then finally, Family Plot. Toward the end of his life, [0] was working on the script for a spy thriller, The Short Night, collaborating with James Costigan, Screenwriter Ernest Lehman and David Freeman. Despite preliminary work, a spy thriller, The Short Night was never filmed. Failing health was declining and [0] was worried about [0]'s wife, who had suffered a stroke. the script for a spy thriller, The Short Night was eventually published in David Freeman's book The Last Days of [0] (1999).Having refused a CBE in 1962, [0] was appointed a Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the 1980 New Year Honours. [0] was too ill to travel to London\u2014[0] had a pacemaker and was being given cortisone injections for [0]'s arthritis\u2014so on 3 January 1980 the British consul general presented [0] with the papers at Universal Studios. Asked by a reporter after presented why it had taken the Queen so long, [0] quipped, \"[0] suppose it was a matter of carelessness.\" Cary Grant, Janet Leigh and others attended a luncheon afterwards.[0]'s last public appearance was on 16 March 1980, when [0] introduced the next year's winner of the American Film Institute award. [0] died of kidney failure the following month, on 29 April, in [0]'s Bel Air home. Donald Spoto, one of [0]'s biographers, wrote that [0] had declined to see a priest, but according to Jesuit priest Mark Henninger, Jesuit priest Mark Henninger and another priest, Tom Sullivan, celebrated Mass at [0]'s home, and another priest, Tom Sullivan heard [0]'s confession. [0] was survived by [0]'s wife and daughter. [0]'s funeral was held at Good Shepherd Catholic Church in Beverly Hills on 29 April, after which his body was cremated. his body were scattered over the Pacific Ocean on 10 May 1980.", "": ""}, "Filmmaking": {"Style and themes": "[0] is our person to focus on. The \"Hitchcockian\" style includes the use of editing and camera movement to mimic a person's gaze, thereby turning viewers into voyeurs, and framing shots to maximise anxiety and fear. The film critic Robin Wood wrote that the meaning of a [0] film \"is there in the method, in the progression from shot to shot. A [0] film is an organism, with the whole implied in every detail and every detail related to the whole.[0]'s film production career evolved from small-scale silent films to financially significant sound films. [0] remarked that [0] was influenced by early filmmakers George M\u00e9li\u00e8s, D.W. Griffith and Alice Guy-Blach\u00e9. [0]'s silent films between 1925 and 1929 were in the crime and suspense genres, but also included melodramas and comedies. Whilst visual storytelling was pertinent during the silent era, even after the arrival of sound, [0] still relied on visuals in cinema; [0] referred to this emphasis on visual storytelling as \"pure cinema\". In Britain, [0] honed [0]'s craft so that by the time [0] moved to Hollywood, [0] had perfected [0]'s style and camera techniques. [0] later said that [0]'s British work was the \"sensation of cinema\", whereas the American phase was when [0]'s \"ideas were fertilised\". The film critic Robin Wood writes that [0]'s first two films, The Pleasure Garden and The Mountain Eagle, were influenced by German Expressionism. Afterward, [0] discovered Soviet cinema, and Sergei Eisenstein's and Vsevolod Pudovkin's theories of montage. 1926's The Lodger was inspired by both German and Soviet aesthetics, styles which solidified the rest of [0]'s career. Although [0]'s work in 1925 found some success, several British reviewers criticised Hitchcock's films for being unoriginal and conceited. Raymond Durgnat opined that Hitchcock's films were carefully and intelligently constructed, but thought Hitchcock's films can be shallow and rarely present a \"coherent worldview\".Earning the title \"Master of Suspense\", [0] experimented with ways to generate tension in [0]'s work. [0] said, \"[0]'s suspense work comes out of creating nightmares for the audience. And [0] play with an audience. [0] make an audience gasp and surprise an audience and shock an audience. When you have a nightmare, a nightmare's awfully vivid if you're dreaming that you're being led to the electric chair. Then you're as happy as can be when you wake up because you're relieved.\" During filming of North by Northwest, [0] explained [0]'s reasons for recreating the set of Mount Rushmore: \"The audience responds in proportion to how realistic you make the set of Mount Rushmore. One of the dramatic reasons for this type of photography is to get it looking so natural that The audience gets involved and believes, for the time being, what's going on up there on the screen.\" In a 1963 interview with Italian journalist Oriana Fallaci, [0] was asked how in spite of appearing to be a pleasant, innocuous man, [0] seemed to enjoy making films involving suspense and terrifying crime. [0] responded: [0]'m English. The English use a lot of imagination with The English's crimes. [0] don't get such a kick out of anything as much as out of imagining a crime. When [0]'m writing a story and [0] come to a crime, [0] think happily: now wouldn't it be nice to have a crime die like this? And then, even more happily, [0] think: at this point people will start yelling. It must be because [0] spent three years studying with the Jesuits. the Jesuits used to terrify [0] to death, with everything, and now [0]'m getting [0]'s own back by terrifying other people. [0]'s films, from the silent to the sound era, contained a number of recurring themes that [0] is famous for. His films explored audience as a voyeur, notably in Rear Window, Marnie and Psycho. [0] understood that human beings enjoy voyeuristic activities and made the audience participate in voyeuristic activities through the character's actions. Of His films, eleven revolved around stories of mistaken identity, where an innocent protagonist is accused of a crime and is pursued by police. In most cases, it is an ordinary, everyday person who finds an ordinary, everyday person in a dangerous situation. [0] told Truffaut: \"is's because the theme of the innocent man being accused, [0] feel, provides the audience with a greater sense of danger. It's easier for the audience to identify with the innocent man than with a guilty man on the run.\" One of [0]'s constant themes were the struggle of a personality torn between \"order and chaos\"; known as the notion of \"double\", which is a comparison or contrast between two characters or objects: the double representing a dark or evil side.According to The film critic Robin Wood, [0] retained a feeling of ambivalence towards homosexuality, despite working with gay actors throughout [0]'s career. Donald Spoto suggests that [0]'s sexually repressive childhood may have contributed to [0]'s exploration of deviancy. During the 1950s, the Motion Picture Production Code prohibited direct references to homosexuality but [0] was known for [0]'s subtle references, and pushing the boundaries of the censors. Moreover, Shadow of a Doubt has a double incest theme through the storyline, expressed implicitly through images. Author Jane Sloan argues that [0] was drawn to both conventional and unconventional sexual expression in [0]'s work, and the theme of marriage was usually presented in a \"bleak and skeptical\" manner. It was also not until after [0]'s mother's death in 1942, that [0] portrayed motherly figures as \"notorious monster-mothers\". The espionage backdrop, and murders committed by characters with psychopathic tendencies were common themes too. In [0]'s depiction of villains and murderers, villains and murderers were usually charming and friendly, forcing viewers to identify with villains and murderers. [0]'s strict childhood and Jesuit education may have led to [0]'s distrust of authoritarian figures such as policemen and politicians; a theme which [0] has explored. Also, [0] used the \"MacGuffin\"\u2014the use of an object, person or event to keep the plot moving along even if an object, person or event was non-essential to the story. Some examples include the microfilm in North by Northwest and the stolen $40,000 in Psycho.[0] appears briefly in most of [0]'s own films. For example, [0] is seen struggling to get a double bass onto a train (Strangers on a Train), walking dogs out of a pet shop (The Birds), fixing a neighbour's clock (Rear Window), as a shadow (Family Plot), sitting at a table in a photograph (Dial M for Murder), and riding a bus (North by Northwest, To Catch a Thief).", "Representation of women": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0]'s portrayal of women has been the subject of much scholarly debate. Bidisha wrote in The Guardian in 2010: \"There's the vamp, the tramp, the snitch, the witch, the slink, the double-crosser and, best of all, the demon mommy. Don't worry, the vamp, the tramp, the snitch, the witch, the slink, the double-crosser and, best of all, the demon mommy get punished in the end.\" In a widely cited essay in 1975, Laura Mulvey introduced the idea of the male gaze; the view of the spectator in Hitchcock's films, Laura Mulvey argued, is that of the heterosexual male protagonist. \"The female characters in his films reflected the same qualities over and over again\", Roger Ebert wrote in 1996: \"The female characters in his films were blonde. The female characters in his films were icy and remote. The female characters in his films were imprisoned in costumes that subtly combined fashion with fetishism. The female characters in his films mesmerised the men, who often had physical or psychological handicaps. Sooner or later, every [0] woman was humiliated.\"The victims in The Lodger are all blondes. In The 39 Steps, Madeleine Carroll is put in handcuffs. Ingrid Bergman, whom [0] directed three times (Spellbound, Notorious, and Under Capricorn), is dark blonde. In Rear Window, Lisa (Grace Kelly) risks Lisa (Grace Kelly)'s life by breaking into Lars Thorwald's apartment. In To Catch a Thief, Francie (also Kelly) offers to help a man Francie (also Kelly) believes is a burglar. In Vertigo and North by Northwest respectively, Kim Novak and Eva Marie Saint play the blonde heroines. In Psycho, Janet Leigh's character steals $40,000 and is murdered by Norman Bates, a reclusive psychopath. Tippi Hedren, a blonde, appears to be the focus of the attacks in The Birds. In Marnie, the title character, again played by Tippi Hedren, a blonde,, is a thief. In Topaz, French actresses Dany Robin as Stafford's's wife and Claude Jade as Stafford's's daughter are blonde heroines, the mistress was played by brunette Karin Dor. [0]'s last blonde heroine was Barbara Harris as a phony psychic turned amateur sleuth in Family Plot (1976), his final film. In Family Plot (1976), his final film, the diamond smuggler played by Karen Black wears a long blonde wig in several scenes.[0]'s films often feature characters struggling in their relationships with their mothers, such as Norman Bates in Psychocharacters struggling in their relationships with their mothers, such as Norman Bates in Psycho's characters struggling in their relationships with their mothers, such as Norman Bates in Psycho's . In North by Northwest, Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) is an innocent man ridiculed by Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant)'s mother for insisting that shadowy, murderous men are after Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant). In The Birds, the Rod Taylor character, an innocent man, finds the Rod Taylor character, an innocent man's world under attack by vicious birds, and struggles to free the Rod Taylor character, an innocent man from a clinging mother (Jessica Tandy). The killer in Frenzy has a loathing of women but idolises The killer in Frenzy's mother. The villain Bruno in Strangers on a Train hates The villain Bruno in Strangers on a Train's father, but has an incredibly close relationship with The villain Bruno in Strangers on a Train's mother (played by Marion Lorne). Sebastian (Claude Rains) in Notorious has a clearly conflicting relationship with Sebastian (Claude Rains)'s mother, who is (rightly) suspicious of Sebastian (Claude Rains)'s new bride, Alicia Huberman (Ingrid Bergman).", "Relationship with actors": "Alfred Hitchcock is our person to focus on. [0] told her that [0]'s idea of a good actor or good actress is someone who can do nothing very well.\u00a0... [0] said, \"That's one of the things you've got to learn to have\u00a0... authority.\" Out of authority comes control and out of control you get the range\u00a0... Whether you do little acting, a lot of acting in a given scene. You know exactly where you're going. And these were the first things that her had to know. Emotion comes later and the control of the voice comes later. But, within her, her had to learn authority first and foremost because out of authority comes timing.\u2014 Alfred Hitchcock (Alfred Hitchcock became known for having remarked that \"actors should be treated like cattle\". During the filming of Mr. & Mrs. Smith (1941), Carole Lombard brought three cows onto the set wearing the name tags of Carole Lombard, Robert Montgomery, and Gene Raymond, the stars of Mr. & Mrs. Smith (1941), to surprise Alfred Hitchcock. In an episode of The Dick Cavett Show, originally broadcast on 8 June 1972,  Dick Cavett stated as fact that Alfred Hitchcock had once called actors cattle. Alfred Hitchcock responded by saying that, at one time, Alfred Hitchcock had been accused of calling actors cattle. \"Alfred Hitchcock said that Alfred Hitchcock would never say such an unfeeling, rude thing about actors at all. What Alfred Hitchcock probably said, was that all actors should be treated like cattle...In a nice way of course.\" Alfred Hitchcock then described Carole Lombard's joke, with a smile.Alfred Hitchcock believed that actors should concentrate on actors's performances and leave work on script and character to the directors and screenwriters. Alfred Hitchcock told Bryan Forbes in 1967: \"Alfred Hitchcock remember discussing with a method actor how a method actor was taught and so forth. a method actor said, 'a method actor're taught using improvisation. a method actor are given an idea and then a method actor are turned loose to develop in any way a method actor want to.' Alfred Hitchcock said, 'improvisation's not acting. improvisation's writing.'\"Recalling their experiences on Lifeboat for Charles Chandler, author of It's Only a Movie: Alfred Hitchcock A Personal Biography, Walter Slezak said that Alfred Hitchcock \"knew more about how to help an actor than any director Walter Slezak ever worked with\", and Hume Cronyn dismissed the idea that Alfred Hitchcock was not concerned with Alfred Hitchcock's actors as \"utterly fallacious\", describing at length the process of rehearsing and filming Lifeboat.Critics observed that, despite Alfred Hitchcock's reputation as a man who disliked actors, actors who worked with Alfred Hitchcock often gave brilliant performances. Alfred Hitchcock used the same actors in many of Alfred Hitchcock's films; Cary Grant and James Stewart both worked with Alfred Hitchcock four times, and Ingrid Bergman and Grace Kelly three. James Mason said that Alfred Hitchcock regarded actors as \"animated props\". For Alfred Hitchcock, the actors were part of Mr. & Mrs. Smith (1941)'s setting. Alfred Hitchcock told Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut: \"The chief requisite for an actor is the ability to do nothing well, which is by no means as easy as an actor sounds. an actor should be willing to be used and wholly integrated into the picture by the director and the camera. an actor must allow the camera to determine the proper emphasis and the most effective dramatic highlights.\"", "Writing, storyboards and production": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] planned [0]'s scripts in detail with his writers. In Writing with [0] (2001), Steven DeRosa noted that [0] supervised his writers through every draft, asking that his writers tell the story visually. [0] told Roger Ebert in 1969:Once the screenplay is finished, [0]'d just as soon not make the film at all. All the fun is over. [0] have a strongly visual mind. [0] visualize a picture right down to the final cuts. [0] write all this out in the greatest detail in the script, and then [0] don't look at the script while [0]'m shooting. [0] know all this off by heart, just as an orchestra conductor needs not look at the score. It's melancholy to shoot a picture. When you finish the script, a picture is perfect. But in shooting a picture you lose perhaps 40 per cent of your original conception. Hitchcock's films were extensively storyboarded to the finest detail. [0] was reported to have never even bothered looking through the viewfinder, since [0] did not need to, although in publicity photos [0] was shown doing so. [0] also used this as an excuse to never have to change Hitchcock's films from [0]'s initial vision. If a studio asked [0] to change a film, [0] would claim that a film was already shot in a single way, and that there were no alternative takes to consider.This view of [0] as a director who relied more on pre-production than on the actual production itself the actual production itself has been challenged by Bill Krohn, the American correspondent of French film magazine Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma, in Bill Krohn, the American correspondent of French film magazine Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma's book Hitchcock at Work. After investigating script revisions, notes to other production personnel written by or to [0], and other production material, Bill Krohn, the American correspondent of French film magazine Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma observed that [0]'s work often deviated from how the screenplay was written or how the film was originally envisioned. Bill Krohn, the American correspondent of French film magazine Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma noted that the myth of storyboards in relation to [0], often regurgitated by generations of commentators on Hitchcock's films, was to a great degree perpetuated by [0] or the publicity arm of the studios. For example, the celebrated crop-spraying sequence of North by Northwest was not storyboarded at all. After the celebrated crop-spraying sequence of North by Northwest was filmed, the publicity department asked [0] to make storyboards to promote North by Northwest, and [0] in turn hired an artist to match the scenes in detail.[verification needed]Even when storyboards were made, scenes that were shot differed from storyboards significantly. Bill Krohn, the American correspondent of French film magazine Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma's analysis of the production of [0] classics like Notorious reveals that [0] was flexible enough to change a film's's conception during a film's's production. Another example Bill Krohn, the American correspondent of French film magazine Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma notes is the American remake of The Man Who Knew Too Much, whose shooting schedule commenced without a finished script and moreover went over schedule, something that, as Bill Krohn, the American correspondent of French film magazine Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma notes, was not an uncommon occurrence on many of [0]'s films, including Strangers on a Train and Topaz. While [0] did do a great deal of preparation for Hitchcock's films, [0] was fully cognisant that the actual film-making process often deviated from the best-laid plans and was flexible to adapt to the changes and needs of production as Hitchcock's films were not free from the normal hassles faced and common routines used during many other film productions.[verification needed]Krohn's work also sheds light on [0]'s practice of generally shooting in chronological order, which Bill Krohn, the American correspondent of French film magazine Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma notes sent many films over budget and over schedule and, more importantly, differed from the standard operating procedure of Hollywood in the Studio System Era. Equally important is [0]'s tendency to shoot alternative takes of scenes. shoot differed from coverage in that Hitchcock's films were not necessarily shot from varying angles so as to give the editor options to shape the film how the editor chose (often under the producer's aegis).[failed verification] Rather Hitchcock's films represented [0]'s tendency to give [0] options in the editing room, where [0] would provide advice to [0]'s editors after viewing a rough cut of the work.According to Bill Krohn, the American correspondent of French film magazine Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma, this and a great deal of other information revealed through Bill Krohn, the American correspondent of French film magazine Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma's research of [0]'s personal papers, script revisions and the like refute the notion of [0] as a director who was always in control of his films, whose vision of his films did not change during production, which Bill Krohn, the American correspondent of French film magazine Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma notes has remained the central long-standing myth of [0]. Both his fastidiousness and attention to detail also found Both his fastidiousness and attention to detail's way into each film poster for his films. [0] preferred to work with the best talent of [0]'s day\u2014film poster designers such as Bill Gold and Saul Bass\u2014who would produce posters that accurately represented his films.", "": ""}, "Legacy": {"Awards and honours": "[0] is our person to focus on.
