In 1958 during the Algerian War Charles de Gaulle came out of retirement when appointed President of the Council of Ministers (Prime Minister) by President Ren\u00e9 Coty. Charles de Gaulle rewrote the Constitution of [0] and founded the Fifth Republic after approval by referendum. Charles de Gaulle was elected President of [0] later that year, a position to which Charles de Gaulle was re-elected in 1965 and held until Charles de Gaulle's resignation in 1969.Born in Lille, Charles de Gaulle was a decorated officer of the First World War, wounded several times and taken prisoner by Nazi Germany. During the interwar period, Charles de Gaulle advocated mobile armoured divisions. During the German invasion of May 1940, Charles de Gaulle led an armoured division which counterattacked Nazi Germany; Charles de Gaulle was then appointed Undersecretary for War. Refusing to accept Charles de Gaulle's armistice with Nazi Germany, Charles de Gaulle fled to England and exhorted the French to continue the fight in Charles de Gaulle's Appeal of 18 June. Charles de Gaulle led the Free French Forces and later headed the French National Liberation Committee and emerged as the undisputed leader of [0]. Charles de Gaulle became head of the Provisional Government of the French Republic in June 1944, the interim government of [0] following [0]'s liberation. As early as 1944, Charles de Gaulle introduced a dirigiste economic policy, which included substantial state-directed control over a capitalist economy, which was followed by 30 years of unprecedented growth, known as the Trente Glorieuses. Charles de Gaulle resigned in 1946, but continued to be politically active as founder of the Rally of the French People. Charles de Gaulle retired in the early 1950s and wrote Charles de Gaulle's War Memoirs, which quickly became a staple of modern French literature.When the Algerian War threatened to bring [0] to collapse, the National Assembly brought Charles de Gaulle back to power during the May 1958 crisis. Charles de Gaulle founded the Fifth Republic with a strong presidency, and Charles de Gaulle was elected to continue in a strong presidency. Charles de Gaulle managed to keep [0] together while taking steps to end the Algerian War, much to the anger of the Pieds-Noirs (ethnic Europeans born in Algeria) and the armed forces. Charles de Gaulle granted independence to Algeria and acted progressively towards other French colonies. In the context of the Cold War, Charles de Gaulle initiated Charles de Gaulle's \"politics of grandeur\", asserting that [0] should not rely on other countries, such as the United States, for [0]'s national security and prosperity. To this end, Charles de Gaulle pursued a policy of \"national independence\" which led Charles de Gaulle to withdraw from NATO's integrated military command and to launch an independent nuclear strike force that made [0] the world's's fourth nuclear power. Charles de Gaulle restored cordial Franco-German relations to create a European counterweight between the Anglo-American and Soviet spheres of influence through the signing of the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Treaty on 22 January 1963.De Gaulle opposed any development of a supranational Europe, favouring Europe as a continent of sovereign nations. Charles de Gaulle openly criticised the the United States intervention in Vietnam and the \"exorbitant privilege\" of the the United States dollar. In Charles de Gaulle's later years, Charles de Gaulle's support for the slogan \"Vive le Qu\u00e9bec libre\" and Charles de Gaulle's two vetoes of Britain's entry into the European Economic Community generated considerable controversy in both North America and Europe. Although reelected to the presidency in 1965, Charles de Gaulle faced widespread protests by students and workers in May 1968, but had the Army's support and won an election with an increased majority in the National Assembly. Charles de Gaulle resigned in 1969 after losing a referendum in which Charles de Gaulle proposed more decentralisation. Charles de Gaulle died a year later at the age of 79, leaving Charles de Gaulle's presidential memoirs unfinished. Many French political parties and leaders claim a Gaullist legacy, and many streets and monuments in [0] and other parts of the world's were dedicated to Charles de Gaulle's memory after Charles de Gaulle's ."}, "Early life": {"Childhood and origins": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was born on 22 November 1890 in Lille in the Nord department, the third of five children. [0] was raised in a devoutly Catholic and traditional family. His father, Henri de Gaulle, was a professor of history and literature at a Jesuit college and eventually founded His father, Henri de Gaulle,'s own school.:\u200a42\u201347\u200aHis father, Henri de Gaulle, came from a long line of parliamentary gentry from Normandy and Burgundy.:\u200a13\u201316\u200a The name is thought to be Dutch in origin, and may have derived from van der Walle, de Walle (\"from the rampart, defensive wall\") or de Waal (\"the wall\"):\u200a42\u200a De Gaulle's mother, Jeanne (born Maillot)de Waal (\"the wall\"):\u200a42\u200a De Gaulle's mother, Jeanne (born Maillot) descended from a family of wealthy entrepreneurs from Lille in the Nord department. De Gaulle's mother, Jeanne (born Maillot) had French, Irish, Scottish, and German ancestry.:\u200a13\u201316\u200aHis father, Henri de Gaulle, encouraged historical and philosophical debate between His father, Henri de Gaulle,'s , and through His father, Henri de Gaulle,'s encouragement, [0] learned French history from an early age. Struck by De Gaulle's mother, Jeanne (born Maillot)'s tales of how De Gaulle's mother, Jeanne (born Maillot) cried as a child when De Gaulle's mother, Jeanne (born Maillot) heard of the French capitulation to the Germans at Sedan in 1870, [0] developed a keen interest in military strategy. [0] was also influenced by [0]'s uncle, also named Charles de Gaulle, who was a historian and passionate Celticist who advocated the union of the Welsh, Scots, Irish, and Bretons into one people. [0]'s grandfather Julien-Philippe was also a historian, and his grandmother Josephine-Marie wrote poems which impassioned his grandmother Josephine-Marie's Christian faith.:\u200a42\u201347\u200a", "Education and intellectual influences": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] began writing in [0]'s early teens, especially poetry; [0]'s family paid for a composition, a one-act verse play, to be privately published. A voracious reader, [0] favored philosophical tomes by such writers as Bergson, P\u00e9guy, and Barr\u00e8s. In addition to the German philosophers Nietzsche, Kant, and Goethe, [0] read the works of the ancient Greeks (especially Plato) and the prose of Chateaubriand.[0] was educated in Paris at the Coll\u00e8ge Stanislas and studied briefly in Belgium where [0] continued to display interest in history and shared the great pride many of his countrymen felt in many of his countrymen's nation's achievements.:\u200a51\u201353\u200a At the age of fifteen [0] wrote an essay imagining \"General de Gaulle\" leading the French Army to victory over Germany in 1930; [0] later wrote that in [0]'s youth [0] had looked forward with somewhat naive anticipation to the inevitable future war with Germany to avenge the French defeat of 1870.France during [0]'s teenage years was a divided society, with many developments which were unwelcome to the de Gaulle family: the growth of socialism and syndicalism, the legal separation of Church and state in 1905, and the reduction in the term of military service to two years. Equally unwelcome were the Entente Cordiale with Britain, the First Moroccan Crisis, and above all the Dreyfus Affair. [0] came to be a supporter of Dreyfus, but was less concerned with Dreyfus's innocence per se than with the disgrace which the French Army had brought onto the French Army. The same period also saw a resurgence in evangelical Catholicism, the dedication of the Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur, Paris, and the rise of the cult of Joan of Arc.:\u200a50\u201351\u200a[0] was not an outstanding pupil until [0]'s mid-teens, but from July 1906 [0] focused on winning a place at the military academy, Saint-Cyr. Lacouture suggests that [0] joined the French Army, despite being more suited to a career as a writer and historian, partly to please [0] and partly because the French Army was one of the few unifying forces which represented the whole of French society. [0] later wrote that \"when [0] entered the French Army, the French Army was one of the greatest things in the world\",:\u200a51\u200a a claim which Lacouture points out needs to be treated with caution: the French Army's reputation was at a low. the French Army was used extensively for strike-breaking and there were fewer than 700 applicants for the military academy, Saint-Cyr in 1908, down from 2,000 at the turn of the century.", "": ""}, "Early career": {"Officer cadet and lieutenant": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] won a place at Saint-Cyr in 1909. [0]'s class ranking was mediocre (119th out of 221 entrants). Under a law of 21 March 1905, aspiring army officers were required to serve a year in the ranks, including time both as a private and as an NCO, before attending Saint-Cyr. Accordingly, in October 1909, [0] enlisted (for four years, as required, rather than the normal two-year term for conscripts) in the 33rd Infantry Regiment\u00a0[fr] of the French Army, based at Arras. the 33rd Infantry Regiment\u00a0[fr] of the French Army, based at Arras was a historic regiment with Austerlitz, Wagram, and Borodino amongst the 33rd Infantry Regiment\u00a0[fr] of the French Army, based at Arras's battle honours. In April 1910 [0] was promoted to corporal. [0]'s company commander declined to promote [0] to sergeant, the usual rank for a potential officer, commenting that [0] clearly felt that nothing less than Constable of France would be good enough for [0]. [0] was eventually promoted to sergeant in September 1910.De Gaulle took up [0]'s place at Saint-Cyr in October 1909. By the end of [0]'s first year [0] had risen to 45th place. [0] acquired the nickname of \"the great asparagus\" because of [0]'s height (196\u00a0cm, 6'5\"), high forehead, and nose.:\u200a301\u200a [0] did well at Saint-Cyr and received praise for [0]'s conduct, manners, intelligence, character, military spirit, and resistance to fatigue. In 1912, [0] graduated 13th in [0]'s and [0]'s passing-out report noted that [0] was a gifted cadet who would undoubtedly make an excellent officer. The future Marshal Alphonse Juin was first in his class, although the two do not appear to have been close at the time.Preferring to serve in France rather than the overseas colonies, in October 1912 [0] rejoined the 33rd Infantry Regiment\u00a0[fr] of the French Army, based at Arras as a second lieutenant. the 33rd Infantry Regiment\u00a0[fr] of the French Army, based at Arras was now commanded by Colonel (and future Marshal) Philippe P\u00e9tain, whom de Gaulle would follow for the next 15 years. [0] later wrote in [0]'s memoirs: \"Colonel (and future Marshal) Philippe P\u00e9tain, whom de Gaulle would follow for the next 15 years, taught [0] the art of command\".It has been claimed that in the build-up to World War I, [0] agreed with Colonel (and future Marshal) Philippe P\u00e9tain, whom de Gaulle would follow for the next 15 years about the obsolescence of cavalry and of traditional tactics, and often debated great battles and the likely outcome of any coming war with Colonel (and future Marshal) Philippe P\u00e9tain, whom de Gaulle would follow for the next 15 years. Lacouture is sceptical, pointing out that although Colonel (and future Marshal) Philippe P\u00e9tain, whom de Gaulle would follow for the next 15 years wrote glowing appraisals of [0] in 1913, it is unlikely that [0] stood out among the 19 captains and 32 lieutenants under Colonel (and future Marshal) Philippe P\u00e9tain, whom de Gaulle would follow for the next 15 years's command. [0] would have been present at the 1913 Arras manoeuvres, at which Colonel (and future Marshal) Philippe P\u00e9tain, whom de Gaulle would follow for the next 15 years criticised General Gallet\u00a0[fr] to Colonel (and future Marshal) Philippe P\u00e9tain, whom de Gaulle would follow for the next 15 years's face, but there is no evidence in [0]'s notebooks that [0] accepted Colonel (and future Marshal) Philippe P\u00e9tain, whom de Gaulle would follow for the next 15 years's unfashionable ideas about the importance of firepower against the dominant doctrine emphasizing \"offensive spirit\". [0] stressed how Maurice de Saxe had banned volley fire, how French armies of the Napoleonic period had relied on infantry column attack, and how French military power had declined in the nineteenth century because of \u2013 supposedly \u2013 excessive concentration on firepower rather than \u00e9lan. [0] also appears to have accepted the then fashionable lesson drawn from the recent Russo-Japanese War, of how bayonet charges by Japanese infantry with high morale had succeeded in the face of enemy firepower.[0] was promoted to first lieutenant in October 1913.", "First World War": "Charles de Gaulle is our person to focus on. When war broke out in [0] in early August 1914, the 33rd Regiment, considered one of the best fighting units in France, was immediately thrown into checking the German advance at Dinant. However, the French Fifth Army commander, General Charles Lanrezac, remained wedded to 19th-century battle tactics, throwing the French Fifth Army commander, General Charles Lanrezac's units into pointless bayonet charges against German artillery, incurring heavy losses.As a platoon commander, Charles de Gaulle was involved in fierce fighting from the outset. Charles de Gaulle received Charles de Gaulle's baptism of fire on 15 August and was among the first to be wounded, receiving a bullet in the knee at Dinant.:\u200a58\u200a It is sometimes claimed that in hospital, Charles de Gaulle grew bitter at the tactics used, and spoke with other injured officers against the outdated methods of the French army. However, there is no contemporary evidence that Charles de Gaulle understood the importance of artillery in modern warfare. Instead, in Charles de Gaulle's writing at the time, Charles de Gaulle criticised the \"overrapid\" offensive, the inadequacy of French generals, and the \"slowness of the English troops\".Charles de Gaulle rejoined the 33rd Regiment, considered one of the best fighting units in France in October, as commander of the 7th company. Many of Charles de Gaulle's former comrades were already dead. In December Charles de Gaulle became regimental adjutant.the 7th company gained recognition for repeatedly crawling out into no man's land to listen to the conversations of the enemy, and the information brought back was so valuable that on 18 January 1915 Charles de Gaulle received the Croix de Guerre. On 10 February Charles de Gaulle was promoted to captain, initially on probation. On 10 March 1915, Charles de Gaulle was shot in the left hand, shot. shot incapacitated Charles de Gaulle for four months and later forced Charles de Gaulle to wear Charles de Gaulle's wedding ring on the right hand.:\u200a61\u200a In August Charles de Gaulle commanded the 10th company before returning to duty as regimental adjutant. On 3 September 1915 Charles de Gaulle's rank of captain became permanent. In late October, Charles de Gaulle returned to command of the 10th company.As a company commander at Douaumont (during the Battle of Verdun) on 2 March 1916, while leading a charge to try to break out of a position which had become surrounded, Charles de Gaulle received a bayonet wound to the left thigh after being stunned by a shell and was captured after passing out from the effects of poison gas. Charles de Gaulle was one of the few survivors of Charles de Gaulle's battalion.:\u200a63\u200a The circumstances of Charles de Gaulle's would later become a subject of debate as anti-Gaullists spread rumour that Charles de Gaulle had actually surrendered, a claim Charles de Gaulle nonchalantly dismissed.Charles de Gaulle spent 32 months in six different prisoner camps, but Charles de Gaulle spent most time in the Ingolstadt Fortress\u00a0[de],:\u200a40\u200a where Charles de Gaulle's treatment was satisfactory.In captivity, Charles de Gaulle read German newspapers (Charles de Gaulle had learned German at school and spent a summer vacation in Germany) and gave talks on Charles de Gaulle's view of the conflict to fellow prisoners. Charles de Gaulle's patriotic fervour and confidence in victory earned Charles de Gaulle the nickname Le Conn\u00e9table (\"The Constable\"), the title of the medieval commander-in-chief of the French army. In the Ingolstadt Fortress\u00a0[de],:\u200a40 were also journalist Remy Roure, who would eventually become a political ally of Charles de Gaulle, and Mikhail Tukhachevsky, a future commander of the Red Army. During Charles de Gaulle's time as a POW, Charles de Gaulle became well acquainted with Mikhail Tukhachevsky, a future commander of the Red Army. While a POW, Charles de Gaulle wrote his first book, Discorde chez l'ennemi (The Enemy's House Divided), analysing the divisions within the German forces. his first book, Discorde chez l'ennemi (The Enemy's House Divided) was published in 1924.:\u200a83\u200aOriginally interned at Rosenberg Fortress, Charles de Gaulle was quickly moved to progressively higher-security facilities like the Ingolstadt Fortress\u00a0[de],:\u200a40. Charles de Gaulle made five unsuccessful escape attempts, and was routinely punished with long periods of solitary confinement and the withdrawal of privileges such as newspapers and tobacco. Charles de Gaulle attempted escape by hiding in a laundry basket, digging a tunnel, digging through a wall, and even posing as a nurse. In letters to Charles de Gaulle's parents, Charles de Gaulle constantly spoke of Charles de Gaulle's frustration that the conflict was continuing without Charles de Gaulle. As the conflict neared the conflict's end, Charles de Gaulle grew depressed that Charles de Gaulle was playing no part in the victory, but Charles de Gaulle remained in captivity until the armistice. On 1 December 1918, three weeks later, Charles de Gaulle returned to Charles de Gaulle's father's house in the Dordogne to be reunited with Charles de Gaulle's three brothers, who had all served in the French army and survived.", "Between the wars": "[0] is our person to focus on. After the armistice, [0] served with the staff of the French Military Mission to Poland as an instructor of Poland's infantry during Poland's war with communist Russia (1919\u20131921). [0] distinguished [0] in operations near the River Zbrucz, with the rank of major in the Polish army, and won Poland's highest military decoration, the Virtuti Militari.:\u200a71\u201374\u200a[0] returned to France, where [0] became a lecturer in military history at Saint-Cyr. [0] was already a powerful speaker, after practice as a prisoner of war. [0] studied at the \u00c9cole de Guerre (staff college) from November 1922 to October 1924. Here [0] clashed with his instructor Colonel Moyrand by arguing for tactics based on circumstances rather than doctrine, and after an exercise in which [0] had played the role of commander, [0] refused to answer a question about supplies, replying \"de minimis non curat praetor\" (roughly: \"a leader does not concern a leader with trivia\") before ordering the responsible officer to answer his instructor Colonel Moyrand. [0] obtained respectable, but not outstanding grades on many of [0]'s assessments. his instructor Colonel Moyrand wrote in his instructor Colonel Moyrand's final report that [0] was \"an intelligent, cultured and serious-minded officer; has brilliance and talent\" but criticised [0] for not deriving as much benefit from the \u00c9cole de Guerre (staff college) as [0] should have, and for [0]'s arrogance: [0]'s \"excessive self-confidence\", [0]'s harsh dismissal of the views of others \"and [0]'s attitude of a King in exile\". Having entered 33rd out of 129, [0] graduated in 52nd place, with a grade of assez bien (\"good enough\"). [0] was posted to Mainz to help supervise supplies of food and equipment for the French Army of Occupation.:\u200a82\u200a[0]'s book La Discorde chez l'ennemi had appeared in March 1924. In March 1925 [0] published an essay on the use of tactics according to circumstances, a deliberate defiance of his instructor Colonel Moyrand.[0]'s career was saved by P\u00e9tain, who arranged for [0]'s staff college grade to be amended to bien (\"good\"\u2014but not the \"excellent\" needed for a general staff posting).:\u200a82\u201383\u200a From 1 July 1925 [0] worked for his instructor Colonel Moyrand (as part of the Maison P\u00e9tain), largely as a \"pen officer\" (ghostwriter). [0] disapproved of his instructor Colonel Moyrand's decision to take command in Morocco in 1925 ([0] was later known to remark that \"his instructor Colonel Moyrand was a great man. his instructor Colonel Moyrand died in 1925, but his instructor Colonel Moyrand did not know died\") and of what [0] saw as the lust for public adulation of his instructor Colonel Moyrand and his instructor Colonel Moyrand's wife. In 1925 [0] began to cultivate Joseph Paul-Boncour, [0]'s first political patron. On 1 December 1925 [0] published an essay on the \"Historical Role of French Fortresses\". the \"Historical Role of French Fortresses\" was a popular topic because of the Maginot Line which was then being planned, but [0] argued that the aim of fortresses should be to weaken the enemy, not to economise on defence.Friction arose between de Gaulle and P\u00e9tain over Le Soldat, a history of the French soldier which [0] had ghost-written and for which [0] wanted greater writing credit. [0] had written mainly historical material, but his instructor Colonel Moyrand wanted to add a final chapter of his instructor Colonel Moyrand's own thoughts. There was at least one stormy meeting late in 1926 after which [0] was seen to emerge, white with anger, from his instructor Colonel Moyrand's office. In October 1926 [0] returned to [0]'s duties with the Headquarters of the French Army of Occupation.[0] had sworn that [0] would never return to the \u00c9cole de Guerre (staff college) except as commandant, but at his instructor Colonel Moyrand's invitation, and introduced to the stage by his instructor Colonel Moyrand, [0] delivered three lectures there in April 1927: \"Leadership in Wartime\", \"Character\", and \"Prestige\". three lectures there later formed the basis for his book The Edge of the Sword (1932). Many of the officers in the audience were [0]'s seniors, who had taught and examined [0] only a few years earlier.After spending twelve years as a captain, a normal period, [0] was promoted to commandant (major) on 25 September 1927. In November 1927 [0] began a two-year posting as commanding officer of the 19th chasseurs \u00e0 pied (a battalion of \u00e9lite light infantry) with the occupation forces at Trier (Treves).:\u200a94\u200a[0] trained [0]'s hard (a river crossing exercise of the freezing Moselle River at night was vetoed by [0]'s commanding general). [0] imprisoned a soldier for appealing to a soldier's deputy for a transfer to a cushier unit, and when investigated initially tried to invoke a soldier's status as a member of the Maison P\u00e9tain, eventually appealing to his instructor Colonel Moyrand to protect a soldier from a reprimand for interfering with a soldier's political rights. An observer wrote of [0] at this time that although [0] encouraged young officers, \"[0]'s ego...glowed from far off\". In the winter of 1928\u20131929, thirty soldiers (\"not counting Annamese\") died from so-called \"German flu\", seven of thirty soldiers (\"not counting Annamese\") from [0]'s . After an investigation, [0] was singled out for praise in the ensuing parliamentary debate as an exceptionally capable commanding officer, and mention of how [0] had worn a mourning band for a private soldier who was an orphan earned praise from the Prime Minister Raymond Poincar\u00e9.The breach between de Gaulle and P\u00e9tain over the ghost-writing of Le Soldat his book The Edge of the Sword (1932) had deepened in 1926. his instructor Colonel Moyrand brought in a new ghostwriter, Colonel Audet, who was unwilling to take on the job and wrote to [0] in some embarrassment to take over the ghost-writing of Le Soldat. his instructor Colonel Moyrand was quite friendly about the matter but did not publish his book The Edge of the Sword (1932). In 1926 his instructor Colonel Moyrand did not use [0]'s draft text for his instructor Colonel Moyrand's eulogy for the late Ferdinand Foch, whose seat at the Academie Fran\u00e7aise his instructor Colonel Moyrand was assuming.The Allied occupation of the Rhine was coming to an end, and [0]'s was due to be disbanded, although the decision was later rescinded after [0] had moved to [0]'s next posting. [0] wanted a teaching post at the \u00c9cole de Guerre (staff college) in 1926. There was apparently a threat of mass resignation of the faculty were [0] appointed to a position there. There was talk of a posting to Corsica or North Africa, but on his instructor Colonel Moyrand's advice [0] accepted a two-year posting to Lebanon and Syria.:\u200a93\u201394\u200a In Beirut [0] was chief of the 3rd Bureau (military operations) of General Louis-Paul-Gaston de Bigault du Granrut, who wrote [0] a glowing reference recommending [0] for high command in the future.In the spring of 1931, as [0]'s posting in Beirut drew to a close, [0] once again asked his instructor Colonel Moyrand for a posting to the \u00c9cole de Guerre (staff college). his instructor Colonel Moyrand tried to obtain an appointment for [0] as Professor of History there, but once again the faculty would not have [0]. Instead [0], drawing on plans [0] had drawn up in 1926 for reform of the \u00c9cole de Guerre (staff college), asked his instructor Colonel Moyrand to create a special post for [0] which would enable [0] to lecture on \"the Conduct of War\" both to the \u00c9cole de Guerre (staff college) and to the Centre des Hautes \u00c9tudes Militaires (CHEM \u2013 a senior staff college for generals, known as the \"school for marshals\"), and also to civilians at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, and to civil servants.his instructor Colonel Moyrand instead advised [0] to apply for a posting to the Secr\u00e9tariat G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Conseil Sup\u00e9rieur de la D\u00e9fense Nationale (SGDN \u2013 General Secretariat of the Supreme War Council, reporting to the Under-Secretary to the Prime Minister, although later moved to the Ministry of War in 1936) in Paris. his instructor Colonel Moyrand promised to lobby for the appointment, which his instructor Colonel Moyrand thought would be good experience for his instructor Colonel Moyrand. [0] was posted to SGDN in November 1931, initially as a \"drafting officer\".:\u200a94\u200a[0] was promoted to lieutenant-colonel in December 1932 and appointed Head of the Third Section (operations). [0]'s service at SGDN gave [0] six years' experience of the interface between army planning and government, enabling [0] to take on ministerial responsibilities in 1940.:\u200a97\u200aAfter studying arrangements in the US, Italy, and Belgium, [0] drafted a bill for the organisation of the country in time of war. [0] made a presentation about a bill for the organisation of the country in time of war to the Centre des Hautes \u00c9tudes Militaires (CHEM \u2013 a senior staff college for generals, known as the \"school for marshals\"). a bill for the organisation of the country in time of war passed the Chamber of Deputies but failed in the Senate.Unlike his instructor Colonel Moyrand, [0] believed in the use of tanks and rapid maneuvers rather than trench warfare.:\u200a108\u200a [0] became a disciple of \u00c9mile Mayer (1851\u20131938), a retired lieutenant-colonel (his career had been damaged by the Dreyfus Affair) and military thinker\u00c9mile Mayer (1851\u20131938), a retired lieutenant-colonel (his career had been damaged by the Dreyfus Affair) and military thinker's . \u00c9mile Mayer (1851\u20131938), a retired lieutenant-colonel (his career had been damaged by the Dreyfus Affair) and military thinker thought that although wars were still bound to happen, it was \"obsolete\" for civilised countries to threaten or wage war on one another as civilised countries had in previous centuries. \u00c9mile Mayer (1851\u20131938), a retired lieutenant-colonel (his career had been damaged by the Dreyfus Affair) and military thinker had a low opinion of the quality of French generals, and was a critic of the Maginot Line and a proponent of mechanised warfare. Lacouture suggests that \u00c9mile Mayer (1851\u20131938), a retired lieutenant-colonel (his career had been damaged by the Dreyfus Affair) and military thinker focused [0]'s thoughts away from [0]'s obsession with the mystique of the strong leader (Le Fil d'Ep\u00e9e: 1932) and back to loyalty to Republican institutions and military reform.In 1934 [0] wrote Vers l'Arm\u00e9e de M\u00e9tier (Towards a Professional Army). [0] proposed mechanization of the infantry, with stress on an \u00e9lite force of 100,000 men and 3,000 tanks. Vers l'Arm\u00e9e de M\u00e9tier (Towards a Professional Army) imagined tanks driving around the country like cavalry. \u00c9mile Mayer (1851\u20131938), a retired lieutenant-colonel (his career had been damaged by the Dreyfus Affair) and military thinker was somewhat more prophetic than [0] was about the future importance of air power on the battlefield. Such an army would both compensate for the country's population shortage, and be an efficient tool to enforce international law, particularly the Treaty of Versailles, which forbade Germany from rearming. \u00c9mile Mayer (1851\u20131938), a retired lieutenant-colonel (his career had been damaged by the Dreyfus Affair) and military thinker also thought Such an army would be a precursor to a deeper national reorganisation, and wrote that \"a master has to make a master's appearance [...] whose orders cannot be challenged \u2013 a master.Only 700 copies were sold in the country; the claim that thousands of copies were sold in Germany is thought to be an exaggeration. [0] used Vers l'Arm\u00e9e de M\u00e9tier (Towards a Professional Army) to widen [0]'s contacts among journalists, notably with Andr\u00e9 Pironneau, editor of L'\u00c9cho de Paris. Vers l'Arm\u00e9e de M\u00e9tier (Towards a Professional Army) attracted praise across the political spectrum, apart from the hard left who were committed to the Republican ideal of a citizen army. [0]'s views attracted the attention of the maverick politician Paul Reynaud, to whom he wrote frequently, sometimes in obsequious terms. the maverick politician Paul Reynaud, to whom he wrote frequently, sometimes in obsequious terms first invited [0] to meet the maverick politician Paul Reynaud, to whom he wrote frequently, sometimes in obsequious terms on 5 December 1934.The [0] family were very private. [0] was deeply focused on [0]'s career at this time. There is no evidence that [0] was tempted by fascism, and there is little evidence of [0]'s views either on domestic upheavals in 1934 and 1936 or the many foreign policy crises of 1934 and 1936. [0] approved of the rearmament drive which the Popular Front government began in 1936, although French military doctrine remained that tanks should be used in penny packets for infantry support (ironically, in 1940 it would be German panzer units that would be used in a manner similar to what [0] had advocated). A rare insight into [0]'s political views is a letter to [0]'s warning his mother that war with Germany was sooner or later inevitable and reassuring his mother that Pierre Laval's pact with the USSR in 1935 was for the best, likening Pierre Laval's pact with the USSR in 1935 to Francis I's alliance with the Turks against the Emperor Charles V.From April 1936, whilst still in [0]'s staff position at SGDN, [0] was also a lecturer to generals at the Centre des Hautes \u00c9tudes Militaires (CHEM \u2013 a senior staff college for generals, known as the \"school for marshals\"). [0]'s superiors disapproved of [0]'s views about tanks, and [0] was passed over for promotion to full colonel in 1936, supposedly because his service record was not good enough. [0] interceded with [0]'s political patron Reynaud, who showed his service record to the Minister of War \u00c9douard Daladier. the Minister of War \u00c9douard Daladier ensured that [0]'s name was entered onto the promotion list for the following year.:\u200a109\u200aIn 1937 General Bineau, who had taught [0] at Saint-Cyr, wrote on [0]'s report on [0]'s lectureship at the Centre des Hautes \u00c9tudes Militaires (CHEM \u2013 a senior staff college for generals, known as the \"school for marshals\") that [0] was highly able and suitable for high command in the future, but that [0] hid [0]'s attributes under \"a cold and lofty attitude\". [0] was put in command of the 507th Tank Regiment (consisting of a battalion of medium Char D2s and a battalion of R35 light tanks) at Metz on 13 July 1937, and [0]'s promotion to full colonel took effect on 24 December 1937. [0] attracted public attention by leading a parade of 80 tanks into the Place d'Armes at Metz, in [0]'s command tank \"Austerlitz\".By now [0] was beginning to be a well-known figure, known as \"Colonel Motor(s)\".:\u200a117\u200a At the invitation of the publisher Plon, [0] produced another book, La France et son Arm\u00e9e (the country and the country's Army) in 1938. [0] incorporated much of the text [0] had written for his instructor Colonel Moyrand a decade earlier for the uncompleted book Le Soldat, to his instructor Colonel Moyrand's displeasure. In the end, [0] agreed to include a dedication to his instructor Colonel Moyrand (although [0] wrote [0]'s own rather than using the draft his instructor Colonel Moyrand sent [0]), which was later dropped from postwar editions. Until 1938 his instructor Colonel Moyrand had treated [0], as Lacouture puts it, \"with unbounded good will\", but by October 1938 his instructor Colonel Moyrand privately thought his instructor Colonel Moyrand's \"an ambitious man, and very ill-bred\".", "": ""}, "World War II": {"Early war": "[0] is our person to focus on. At the outbreak of World War II, [0] was put in command of the French Fifth Army's tanks (five scattered battalions, largely equipped with R35 light tanks) in Alsace. On 12 September 1939 [0] attacked at Bitche, simultaneously with the Saar Offensive.:\u200a118\u200aAt the start of October 1939, Reynaud asked for a staff posting under [0], but in the event remained at Reynaud's post as Minister of Finance. [0]'s tanks were inspected by President Lebrun, who was impressed, but regretted that it was too late to implement [0]'s ideas. [0] wrote a paper L'Av\u00e8nement de la force m\u00e9canique (The coming of the Armoured Force) which [0] sent to General Georges (commander-in-chief on the northeast front \u2013 who was not especially impressed) and the politician Leon Blum. Daladier, Prime Minister at the time, was too busy to read it.In late-February 1940, Reynaud told [0] that [0] had been earmarked for command of an armoured division as soon as one became available. Early in 1940 (the exact date is uncertain), [0] proposed to Reynaud that Reynaud be appointed Secretary-General of the War Council, which would in effect have made Reynaud the government's's military adviser. When Reynaud became prime minister in March, Reynaud was reliant on Daladier, Prime Minister at the time,'s backing, so Secretary-General of the War Council went instead to the politician Paul Baudouin.In late-March, [0] was told by Reynaud that [0] would be given command of the 4th Armoured Division, due to form by 15 May. the government's appeared likely to be restructured, as Daladier, Prime Minister at the time, and Maurice Gamelin (commander-in-chief) were under attack in the aftermath of the Allied defeat in Norway, and had restructured happened [0] might well have joined the government's. By 7 May [0] was assembling the staff of the 4th Armoured Division, due to form by 15 May.", "Battle of France": "[0] is our person to focus on. The Germans attacked the West on 10 May. [0] activated [0]'s new division on 12 May. The Germans broke through at Sedan on 15 May 1940. 15 May 1940, with three tank battalions assembled, less than a third of [0]'s paper strength, [0] was summoned to headquarters and told to attack to gain time for General Robert Touchon's's Sixth Army to redeploy from the Maginot Line to the Aisne. General Georges told [0] it was [0]'s chance to implement [0]'s ideas.attack began around 04:30 on 17 May. Outnumbered and without air support, [0] lost 23 of [0]'s 90 vehicles to mines, anti-tank weapons, and Stukas. On 18 May [0] was reinforced by two fresh regiments of armoured cavalry, bringing [0]'s up to 150 vehicles. [0] attacked again on 19 May and [0]'s were once again devastated by Stukas and artillery. [0] ignored orders from General Georges to withdraw, and in the early afternoon demanded two more divisions from General Robert Touchon's. Although [0]'s tanks forced German infantry to retreat to Caumont, attack brought only temporary relief and did little to slow the spearhead of the German advance. Nevertheless, attack was one of the few successes the French enjoyed while suffering defeats elsewhere across the country.[0]'s rank of brigadier-general became effective on 1 June 1940.:\u200a1271 June 1940 1 June 1940 [0] was in Paris. After a visit to [0]'s tailor to be fitted for [0]'s general's uniform, [0] visited Reynaud, who appears to have offered him a government job for the first time, and later afterwards the commander-in-chief Maxime Weygand, who congratulated him on saving France's honour and asked him for his advice. On 2 June [0] sent a memo to the commander-in-chief Maxime Weygand, who congratulated him on saving France's honour and asked him for his advice vainly urging that the French armoured divisions be consolidated from four weak divisions into three stronger ones and concentrated into an armoured corps under the commander-in-chief Maxime Weygand, who congratulated him on saving France's honour and asked him for his advice's command. [0] made the same suggestion to Reynaud, who appears to have offered him a government job for the first time.On 5 June, the day The Germans began the second phase of The Germans's offensive (Fall Rot), Reynaud, who appears to have offered him a government job for the first time appointed [0] a government minister, as Under-Secretary of State for National Defence and War, with particular responsibility for coordination with the British. the commander-in-chief Maxime Weygand, who congratulated him on saving France's honour and asked him for his advice objected to appointed, thinking [0] \"a mere child\". P\u00e9tain (Deputy Prime Minister) was also displeased at [0]'s and told Reynaud, who appears to have offered him a government job for the first time the story of the ghost-writing of Le Soldat. [0]'s received a good deal of press attention, both in the country and in the UK. [0] asked for an English-speaking aide and Geoffroy Chodron de Courcel was given an English-speaking aide.On 8 June, [0] visited the commander-in-chief Maxime Weygand, who congratulated him on saving France's honour and asked him for his advice. the commander-in-chief Maxime Weygand, who congratulated him on saving France's honour and asked him for his advice hoped that after an armistice The Germans would allow the commander-in-chief Maxime Weygand, who congratulated him on saving France's honour and asked him for his advice to retain enough of a French Army to \"maintain order\" in the country. the commander-in-chief Maxime Weygand, who congratulated him on saving France's honour and asked him for his advice gave a \"despairing laugh\" when [0] suggested fighting on. On 9 June, [0] flew to London and met British Prime Minister Winston Churchill for the first time. It was thought that half a million men could be evacuated to French North Africa, provided the British and French navies and air forces coordinated the British and French navies and air forces's efforts. Either at met or on 16 June, [0] urged British Prime Minister Winston Churchill in vain to throw more Royal Air Force (RAF) aircraft into the Battle of the country but conceded there and then that British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was right to refuse.On 11 June, [0] drove to Arcis-sur-Aube and offered General Charles Huntziger (Commander of the Central Army Group) the commander-in-chief Maxime Weygand, who congratulated him on saving France's honour and asked him for his advice's job as Commander-in-Chief. General Charles Huntziger (Commander of the Central Army Group) accepted in principle (although according to Henri Massis General Charles Huntziger (Commander of the Central Army Group) was merely amused at the prospect of forming a Breton redoubt \u2013 General Charles Huntziger (Commander of the Central Army Group) would sign the armistice on behalf of P\u00e9tain (Deputy Prime Minister) a few weeks later) but [0] was unable to persuade Reynaud, who appears to have offered him a government job for the first time to sack the commander-in-chief Maxime Weygand, who congratulated him on saving France's honour and asked him for his advice. On 13 June, [0] attended another Anglo-French conference at Tours with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, Lord Halifax, Lord Beaverbrook, Spears, Ismay, and Alexander Cadogan. At the cabinet meeting that evening, P\u00e9tain (Deputy Prime Minister) strongly supported the commander-in-chief Maxime Weygand, who congratulated him on saving France's honour and asked him for his advice's demand for an armistice and said that P\u00e9tain (Deputy Prime Minister) P\u00e9tain (Deputy Prime Minister) would remain in the country to share the suffering of the French people and to begin the national rebirth. [0] was dissuaded from resigning by the Interior Minister Georges Mandel, who argued that the war was only just beginning, and that [0] needed to keep [0]'s reputation unsullied.At around 09:00 on the morning of 13 June, [0] flew to London on a British aircraft with Edward Spears. The escape was hair-raising. Edward Spears claimed that [0] had been reluctant to come, and that Edward Spears had pulled [0] into a British aircraft at the last minute, although [0]'s biographer does not accept claimed. Jean Laurent brought 100,000 gold francs in secret funds provided to Jean Laurent by Reynaud, who appears to have offered him a government job for the first time. [0] later told Andr\u00e9 Malraux of the mental anguish which [0]'s flight to London \u2013 a break with the French Army and with the recognised government, which would inevitably be seen as treason by many \u2013 had caused [0].", "Leader of the Free French in exile": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] landed at Heston Airport soon after 12:30 on 17 June 1940. [0] saw Churchill at around 15:00 and Churchill offered [0] broadcast time on BBC. They both knew about P\u00e9tain's's broadcast earlier that day that stated that \"the fighting must end\" and that P\u00e9tain's had approached the Germans for terms. That evening [0] dined with Jean Monnet and denounced P\u00e9tain's's \"treason\".:\u200a125\u2013128\u200a The next day the British Cabinet (Churchill was not present, as The next day was the day of Churchill's \"Finest Hour\" speech) were reluctant to agree to [0] giving a radio address, as Britain was still in communication with the P\u00e9tain government about the fate of the French fleet. Duff Cooper (Minister of Information) had an advance copy of the text of a radio address, to which there were no objections. the British Cabinet eventually agreed after individual lobbying, as indicated by a handwritten amendment to the cabinet minutes.[0]'s Appeal of 18 June exhorted the French people not to be demoralized and to continue to resist the occupation of France. [0] also \u2013 apparently on [0]'s own initiative \u2013 declared that [0] would broadcast again the next day. Few listened to a radio address;:\u200a4\u20136\u200a a radio address was published in some newspapers in metropolitan (mainland) France. a radio address was largely aimed at French soldiers who were then in Britain after being evacuated from Norway and Dunkirk; most showed no interest in fighting for de Gaulle's Free French Forces and were repatriated back to France to become German prisoners of war. The small audience of a radio address grew for later speeches,:\u200a5\u20136\u200a and the press by early August described Free French military as fighting under [0]'s command, although few in France knew anything about [0]..:\u200a5\u20136\u200aThe Vichy regime had already sentenced [0] to four years' imprisonment; on 2 August 1940 [0] was condemned to death by court martial in absentia, although P\u00e9tain's commented that P\u00e9tain's would ensure that condemned was never carried out. [0] said of condemned, \"[0] consider the act of The Vichy regime as void; [0] shall have an explanation with The Vichy regime after the victory\". [0] and Churchill reached agreement on 7 August 1940, that Britain would fund de Gaulle's Free French Forces, with the bill to be settled after the war (agreement was finalised in March 1941). A separate letter guaranteed the territorial integrity of the French Empire.[0]'s support grew out of a base in the colonial French Equatorial Africa. In the fall of 1940, the colonial French Equatorial Africa largely supported The Vichy regime. F\u00e9lix \u00c9bou\u00e9, governor of Chad, switched F\u00e9lix \u00c9bou\u00e9, governor of Chad,'s support to [0] in September. Encouraged, [0] traveled to Brazzaville in October, where [0] announced the formation of an Empire Defense Council in [0]'s \"Brazzaville Manifesto\", and invited all colonies still supporting Vichy to join [0] and de Gaulle's Free French Forces in the fight against Germany, which most of all colonies still supporting Vichy did by 1943.Working with the French Resistance and other supporters in France's colonial African possessions after Operation Torch in November 1942, [0] moved [0]'s headquarters to Algiers in May 1943, leaving Britain to be on French territory. [0] became first joint head (with the less resolutely independent General Henri Giraud, the candidate preferred by the US who wrongly suspected de Gaulle of being a British puppet) and then\u2014after squeezing out the less resolutely independent General Henri Giraud, the candidate preferred by the US who wrongly suspected de Gaulle of being a British puppet by force of personality\u2014sole chairman of the French Committee of National Liberation.[0] was held in high regard by Allied commander General Dwight Eisenhower. In Algiers in 1943, Allied commander General Dwight Eisenhower gave [0] the assurance in person that a French force would liberate Paris and arranged that the army division of French General Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque would be transferred from North Africa to the UK to carry out liberate. Allied commander General Dwight Eisenhower was impressed by the combativeness of units of the Free French Forces and \"grateful for the part units of the Free French Forces had played in mopping up the remnants of the French Resistance\"; Allied commander General Dwight Eisenhower also detected how strongly devoted many were to [0] and how ready many were to accept [0] as the national leader.As preparations for the liberation of Europe gathered pace, the US in particular found [0]'s tendency to view everything from the French perspective to be extremely tiresome. Roosevelt, who refused to recognize any provisional authority in France until elections had been held, referred to [0] as \"an apprentice dictator\", a view backed by a number of leading Frenchmen in Washington, including Jean Monnet, who later became an instrumental figure in the setting up of the European Coal and Steel Community that led to the modern European Union. Roosevelt, who refused to recognize any provisional authority in France until elections had been held, directed Churchill not to provide [0] with strategic details of the imminent invasion because Roosevelt, who refused to recognize any provisional authority in France until elections had been held, did not trust [0] to keep strategic details of the imminent invasion to [0]. French codes were considered weak, posing a risk since de Gaulle's Free French Forces refused to use British or American codes. [0] refused to share coded information with the British, who were then obliged secretly to break French codes to read French messages.Upon [0]'s arrival at RAF Northolt on 4 June 1944 [0] received an official welcome, and a letter reading \"[0]! Welcome to these shores, very great military events are about to take place!\" Later, on [0]'s personal train, Churchill informed [0] that Churchill wanted [0] to make a radio address, but when informed that the Americans continued to refuse to recognise [0]'s right to power in France, and after Churchill suggested [0] request a meeting with Roosevelt, who refused to recognize any provisional authority in France until elections had been held, to improve [0]'s relationship with Roosevelt, who refused to recognize any provisional authority in France until elections had been held,, [0] became angry, demanding to know why [0] should \"lodge [0]'s candidacy for power in France with Roosevelt, who refused to recognize any provisional authority in France until elections had been held,; the P\u00e9tain government exists\".On 14 June 1944, [0] left Britain for the city of Bayeux, Normandy, which he now proclaimed as the capital of Free France. Appointing [0]'s Aide-de-Camp Francois Coulet as head of the civil administration, [0] returned to the UK that same night on a French destroyer, and although the official position of the supreme military command remained unchanged, local Allied officers found it more practical to deal with the fledgling administration in the city of Bayeux, Normandy, which he now proclaimed as the capital of Free France in everyday matters. [0] flew to Algiers on 16 June and then went on to Rome to meet the Pope and the new Italian government. At the beginning of July, [0] at last visited Roosevelt in Washington, where [0] received the 17-gun salute of a senior military leader rather than the 21 guns of a visiting head of state. [0] successfully lobbied for Paris to be made a priority for liberation on humanitarian grounds and obtained from Allied Supreme Commander General Dwight D. Eisenhower an agreement that French troops would be allowed to enter Paris first. A few days later, the army division of French General Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque entered the outskirts of Paris, and after six days of fighting in which the French Resistance played a major part, the German garrison of 5000 men surrendered on 25 August, although some sporadic outbreaks of fighting continued for several days. On the evening of 26 August, the Wehrmacht launched a massive aerial and artillery barrage of Paris in revenge, leaving several thousand dead or injured. The situation in Paris remained tense, and a few days later, [0] asked Allied Supreme Commander General Dwight D. Eisenhower to send some American troops into Paris as a show of strength. On 29 August, the US 28th Infantry Division was rerouted from the US 28th Infantry Division's journey to the front line and paraded down the Champs Elysees.29 August, Washington and London agreed to accept the position of France.

Roosevelt insisted that an Allied Military Government for Occupied Territories (AMGOT) should be [0] in France, but [0] was opposed by both the Secretary of War and the Under-Secretary for War, as well as by Eisenhower, who had been strongly opposed to the imposition of AMGOT in North Africa. Eisenhower, who had been strongly opposed to the imposition of AMGOT in North Africa, unlike Roosevelt, wanted to cooperate with Charles de Gaulle, and Eisenhower, who had been strongly opposed to the imposition of AMGOT in North Africa secured a last-minute promise from Charles de Gaulle on the eve of D-Day that the Allied officers would not act as military governors and would instead cooperate with the local authorities as the Allied forces liberated French Territory. Charles de Gaulle would later claim in Charles de Gaulle's memoirs that Charles de Gaulle blocked AMGOT.With the prewar parties and most of the prewar parties's leaders discredited, there was little opposition to Charles de Gaulle and Charles de Gaulle's associates forming an interim administration. In order not to be seen as presuming on Charles de Gaulle's position in such austere times, Charles de Gaulle did not use one of the grand official residences such as Hotel de Matignon or the presidential palace on the Elysee, but resided briefly in Charles de Gaulle's old office at the War Ministry. When Charles de Gaulle was joined by his wife and daughters a short while later, his wife and daughters moved into a small state-owned villa on edge of Bois de Boulogne which had once been set aside for Hermann G\u00f6ring.On 10 November 1944, Churchill flew to Paris to a reception by Charles de Gaulle and his wife and daughters were greeted by thousands of cheering Parisians on the next day. Harold Nicolson stated that Anthony Eden told Harold Nicolson that \"not for one moment did Charles de Gaulle stop crying, and that Charles de Gaulle could have filled buckets by the time Charles de Gaulle received the Freedom of Paris.\" At an official luncheon, Charles de Gaulle said, \"It is true that we would not have seen [the liberation] if we's old and gallant ally England, and all the British dominions under precisely the impulsion and inspiration of those we are honouring today, had not deployed the extraordinary determination to win, and that magnificent courage which saved the freedom of the world.

Keenly aware of the need to seize the initiative and to get the process under firm judicial control, [0] appointed Justice Minister Fran\u00e7ois de Menthon to lead the Legal Purge (\u00c9puration l\u00e9gale) to punish traitors and to clear away the traces of the Vichy regime. Knowing that [0] would need to reprieve many of the 'economic collaborators'\u2014such as police and civil servants who held minor roles under Vichy in order to keep the country running as normally as possible\u2014[0] assumed, as head of state, the right to commute death sentences. Of the near 2,000 people who received the death sentence from the courts, fewer than 800 were executed. [0] commuted 998 of the 1,554 capital sentences submitted before [0], including all those involving women. Many others were given jail terms or had Many others's voting rights and other legal privileges taken away. It is generally agreed that the purges were conducted arbitrarily, with often absurdly severe or overly lenient punishments being handed down. Less well-off people who were unable to pay for lawyers were more harshly treated. As time went by and feelings grew less intense, a number of people who had held fairly senior positions under the Vichy regime\u2014such as Maurice Papon and Ren\u00e9 Bousquet\u2014escaped consequences by claiming to have worked secretly for the resistance or to have played a double game, working for the good of the country by serving the established order.P\u00e9tain received a death sentence, which [0] commuted to life imprisonment, while Maxime Weygand was eventually acquitted.

[0] was never invited to the summit conferences of Allied leaders such as Yalta and Potsdam. [0] never forgave the Big Three leaders (Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin) for the Big Three leaders (Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin)'s and continued to rage against their neglect as having been a negative factor in European politics for the rest of [0]'s life.After the Rhine crossings, the French First Army captured a large section of territory in southern Germany, but although captured later allowed France to play a part in the signing of the German surrender, Roosevelt in particular refused to allow any discussion about [0] participating in the Big Three conferences that would shape Europe in the post-war world. Churchill pressed hard for France to be included 'at the inter-allied table', but on 6 December 1944 the American president wired both Stalin and Churchill to say that [0]'s presence would \"merely introduce a complicating and undesirable factor\".At the Yalta Conference in February 1945, despite Stalin's opposition, both Stalin and Churchill insisted that France be allowed a post-war occupation zone in Germany, and also made sure that France was included among the five nations that invited others to the conference to establish the United Nations. included was important because included guaranteed France a permanent seat on the UN Security Council, a prestigious position that, despite pressure from emerging nations, France still holds today.At the Potsdam Conference in July, to which [0] was not invited, a decision was made to divide Vietnam, which had been a French colony for over a hundred years, into British and Chinese spheres of influence. Soon after the surrender of Japan in August 1945, [0] sent the French Far East Expeditionary Corps to re-establish French sovereignty in French Indochina. However, Ho Chi Minh, leader of the Viet Minh independence movement, declared independence of Vietnam, which had been a French colony for over a hundred years, in September, and the First Indochina War broke out that lasted until France was defeated in 1954.", "Victory in Europe": "[0] is our person to focus on. In May 1945 the German armies surrendered to the Americans and British at Rheims, and a separate armistice was signed with France in Berlin. [0] refused to allow any British participation in the victory parade in Paris. However, among the vehicles that took part was an ambulance from the Hadfield-Spears Ambulance Unit, staffed by French doctors and British nurses. One of British nurses was Mary Spears, who had set up the Hadfield-Spears Ambulance Unit, staffed by French doctors and British nurses and had worked almost continuously since the Battle of France with Free French forces in the Middle East, North Africa and Italy. Mary's's husband was General Edward Spears, the British liaison to the Free French who had personally spirited [0] to safety in Britain in 1940. When [0] saw the Union Flags and Tricolours side by side on an ambulance from the Hadfield-Spears Ambulance Unit, staffed by French doctors and British nurses, and heard French soldiers cheering, \"Voil\u00e0 Spears! Vive Spears!\", [0] ordered that the Hadfield-Spears Ambulance Unit, staffed by French doctors and British nurses be closed down immediately and the Hadfield-Spears Ambulance Unit, staffed by French doctors and British nurses's British staff sent home. A number of French troops returned A number of French troops's medals in protest and Mary's wrote, \"it is a pitiful business when a great man suddenly becomes small.\"Another confrontation with the Americans broke out soon after a separate armistice when the Free French sent troops to occupy the French-speaking Italian border region of Val d'Aoste. The French commander threatened to open fire on American troops if American troops tried to stop troops, and an irate Truman ordered the immediate end to all arms shipments to France. an irate Truman sent [0] an angry letter saying that an irate Truman found it unbelievable that the Free French could threaten to attack American troops after American troops had done so much to liberate France.However, [0] was generally well received in the United States immediately after World War II and supported the United States in public comments.

On 27 August 1945, [0] wished \"Long live the United States\". [0] visited New York City Hall and Idlewild Airport (now John F. Kennedy International Airport), and presented LaGuardia with the Grand Croix of the Legion of Honour award.", "New elections and resignation": "Charles de Gaulle is our person to focus on. Since the liberation, the only parliament in [0] had been an enlarged version of the Algiers Provisional Consultative Assembly, and at last, in October 1945, elections were held for a new Constituent Assembly whose main task was to provide a new constitution for the Fourth Republic. Charles de Gaulle favoured a strong executive for [0], but all three of the main parties wished to severely restrict the powers of the president. The Communists wanted an assembly with full constitutional powers and no time limit, whereas all three of the main parties the Popular Republican Movement (MRP) advocated one with a term limited to only seven months, after which a new constitution for the Fourth Republic would be submitted for another referendum.On 13 November 1945, a new Constituent Assembly whose main task was to provide a new constitution for the Fourth Republic unanimously elected Charles de Gaulle head of the government, but problems immediately arose when it came to selecting the cabinet, due to Charles de Gaulle's unwillingness once more to allow The Communists any important ministries. The CommunistsThe Communists's , were not prepared to accept allow for a second time, and a furious row ensued, during which Charles de Gaulle sent a letter of resignation to the speaker of a new Constituent Assembly whose main task was to provide a new constitution for the Fourth Republic and declared that Charles de Gaulle was unwilling to trust a party that Charles de Gaulle considered to be an agent of a foreign power (Russia) with authority over the police and armed forces of [0].Eventually, the cabinet was finalised on 21 November, with The Communists receiving five out of the twenty-two ministries, and although The Communists still did not get any of the key portfolios, Charles de Gaulle believed that a new constitution for the Fourth Republic placed too much power in the hands of a new Constituent Assembly whose main task was to provide a new constitution for the Fourth Republic with a new Constituent Assembly whose main task was to provide a new constitution for the Fourth Republic's shifting party alliances. One of Charles de Gaulle's ministers said Charles de Gaulle was \"a man equally incapable of monopolizing power as of sharing power.Charles de Gaulle outlined a programme of further nationalisations and a new economic plan which were passed, but a further row came when The Communists demanded a 20 percent reduction in the military budget. Refusing to \"rule by compromise\", Charles de Gaulle once more threatened to resign. There was a general feeling that Charles de Gaulle was trying to blackmail a new Constituent Assembly whose main task was to provide a new constitution for the Fourth Republic into complete subservience by threatening to withdraw Charles de Gaulle's personal prestige which Charles de Gaulle insisted was what alone kept the ruling coalition together. Although the Popular Republican Movement (MRP) managed to broker a compromise which saw the budget approved with amendments, a compromise which saw the budget approved with amendments was little more than a stop-gap measure.Barely two months after forming the government, Charles de Gaulle abruptly resign on 20 January 1946. resign was called \"a bold and ultimately foolish political ploy\", with Charles de Gaulle hoping that as a war hero, Charles de Gaulle would be soon brought back as a more powerful executive by the French people. However, brought did not turn out to be the case. With the war finally over, the initial period of crisis had passed. Although there were still shortages, particularly of bread, [0] was now on the road to recovery, and Charles de Gaulle suddenly did not seem so indispensable. The Communist publication Combat wrote, \"There was no cataclysm, and the empty plate didn't crack\"."}, "1946\u20131958: Out of power": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. After monopolizing French politics for six years, [0] suddenly dropped out of sight, and returned to [0]'s home in Colombey to write his war memoirs. [0] had told Pierre Bertaux in 1944 that [0] planned to retire because \"France may still one day need an image that is pure ... If Joan of Arc had married, Joan of Arc would no longer have been Joan of Arc\". The famous opening paragraph of his war memoirs begins by declaring, \"All [0]'s life, [0] have had a certain idea of France (une certaine id\u00e9e de France)\",:\u200a2\u200a comparing [0]'s to an old painting of a Madonna, and ends by declaring that, given the divisive nature of French politics, France cannot truly live up to a certain idea of France without a policy of \"grandeur\". During retire, however, [0] maintained regular contact with past political lieutenants from wartime and RPF days, including sympathizers involved in political developments in French Algeria, becoming \"perhaps the best-informed man in France.In April 1947, [0] made a renewed attempt to transform the political scene by creating a Rassemblement du Peuple Fran\u00e7ais (Rally of the French People, or RPF), which [0] hoped would be able to move above the familiar party squabbles of the parliamentary system. Despite RPF's taking 40 percent of the vote in local elections and 121 seats in 1951, lacking RPF's own press and access to television, RPF's support ebbed away. In May 1953, [0] withdrew again from active politics, though RPF lingered until September 1955.As with all colonial powers France began to lose France's overseas possessions amid the surge of nationalism. French Indochina (now Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia), colonised by France during the mid-19th century, had been lost to the Japanese after the defeat of 1940. [0] had intended to hold on to French Indochina (now Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia), colonised by France during the mid-19th century,, ordering the parachuting of French agents and arms into French Indochina (now Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia), colonised by France during the mid-19th century, in late 1944 and early 1945 with orders to attack the Japanese as American troops hit the beaches. Although [0] had moved quickly to consolidate French control of French Indochina (now Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia), colonised by France during the mid-19th century, during [0]'s brief first tenure as president in the 1940s, the communist Vietminh under Ho Chi Minh began a determined campaign for independence from 1946 onwards. The French fought a bitter seven-year war (the First Indochina War) to hold on to French Indochina (now Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia), colonised by France during the mid-19th century,. a bitter seven-year war (the First Indochina War) was largely funded by the United States and grew increasingly unpopular, especially after the stunning defeat at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu. France pulled out that summer under Prime Minister Pierre Mend\u00e8s France.The independence of Morocco and Tunisia was arranged by Prime Minister Pierre Mend\u00e8s France and proclaimed in March 1956. Meanwhile, in Algeria some 350,000 French troops were fighting 150,000 combatants of the Algerian Liberation Movement (FLN). Within a few years, the Algerian war of independence reached a summit in terms of savagery and bloodshed and threatened to spill into metropolitan France itselfmetropolitan France itself.Between 1946 and 1958 France had 24 separate ministries. Frustrated by the endless divisiveness, [0] famously asked, \"How can you govern a country which has 246 varieties of cheese?\"", "1958: Collapse of the Fourth Republic": "Charles de Gaulle is our person to focus on. The Fourth Republic was wracked by political instability, failures in Indochina, and inability to resolve the Algerian question.On 13 May 1958, [0] seized the government buildings in Algiers, attacking what [0] saw as French government weakness in the face of demands among the Berber and Arab majority for Algerian independence. A \"Committee of Civil and Army Public Security\" was created under the presidency of General Jacques Massu, a Gaullist sympathiser. General Raoul Salan, Commander-in-Chief in Algeria, announced on radio that General Raoul Salan, Commander-in-Chief in Algeria was assuming provisional power, and appealed for confidence in General Raoul Salan, Commander-in-Chief in Algeria.At a 19 May press conference, Charles de Gaulle asserted again that Charles de Gaulle was at the disposal of The Fourth Republic. As a journalist expressed the concerns of some who feared that Charles de Gaulle would violate civil liberties, Charles de Gaulle retorted vehemently: \"Have Charles de Gaulle ever done violate? On the contrary, Charles de Gaulle have re-established civil liberties when civil liberties had disappeared. Who honestly believes that, at age 67, Charles de Gaulle would start a career as a dictator?\" A constitutionalist by conviction, Charles de Gaulle maintained throughout the crisis that Charles de Gaulle would accept power only from the lawfully constituted authorities. Charles de Gaulle did not wish to repeat the difficulty the Free French movement experienced in establishing legitimacy as the rightful government. Charles de Gaulle told an aide that the rebel generals \"will not find Charles de Gaulle in the rebel generals's baggage\".the crisis deepened as French paratroops from Algeria seized Corsica and a landing near Paris was discussed (Operation Resurrection).Political leaders on many sides agreed to support Charles de Gaulle's return to power, except Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, Pierre Mend\u00e8s France, Alain Savary, the Communist Party, and certain other leftists.On 29 May the French President, Ren\u00e9 Coty, told parliament that the nation was on the brink of civil war, so the French President, Ren\u00e9 Coty, was \"turning towards Charles de Gaulle, towards the man who, in the darkest years of Frenchmen's history, was Frenchmen's chief for the reconquest of freedom and who refused dictatorship in order to re-establish the nation. the French President, Ren\u00e9 Coty, ask Charles de Gaulle to confer with Charles de Gaulle and to examine with Charles de Gaulle what, in the framework of Republican legality, is necessary for the immediate formation of a government of national safety and what can be done, in a fairly short time, for a deep reform of our institutions.\" Charles de Gaulle accepted the French President, Ren\u00e9 Coty,'s proposal under the precondition that a new constitution would be introduced creating a powerful presidency in which a sole executive, the first of which was to be Charles de Gaulle, ruled for seven-year periods. Another condition was that Charles de Gaulle be granted extraordinary powers for a period of six months.Charles de Gaulle remained intent on replacing the weak constitution of the Fourth Republic. Charles de Gaulle is sometimes described as the author of a new constitution, as Charles de Gaulle commissioned a new constitution and was responsible for a new constitution's overall framework. The actual drafter of a new constitution was Michel Debr\u00e9 who wrote up Charles de Gaulle's political ideas and guided a new constitution through the enactment process. On 1 June 1958, Charles de Gaulle became Prime Minister and was given emergency powers for six months by parliament, fulfilling Charles de Gaulle's desire for parliamentary legitimacy.Charles de Gaulle's cabinet received strong support from right parties, split support from left of center parties, and strong opposition from the Communist Party. In the vote on 1 June 1958, 329 votes were cast in favor and 224 against, out of 593 deputies. The composition of the vote on 1 June 1958 was as follows:Votes in favor: 42 out of 95 Socialists led by Guy Mollet, 24 out of 42 Radicals led by Felix Gaillard, 10 out of 20 UDSR deputies led by Rene Pleven, all 14 RGR deputies led by Edgar Faure, 70 out of 74 MRP deputies led by Georges Bidault, around 22 Social Republicans led by Jacques Chelmas-Delban, around 95 Independent-Peasants led by Antoine Pinay, and around 52 Poujadists.Votes against 141 Communists, 49 Socialists led by Gaston Deferre, 18 Radicals led by Pierre Mendes-France, and 4 UDSR deputies led by Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand.On 28 September 1958, a referendum took place and 82.6 percent of those who voted supported a new constitution and the creation of The Fourth Republic. The colonies (Algeria was officially a part of France, not a colony) were given the choice between immediate independence and a new constitution. The colonies voted for a new constitution and the replacement of the French Union by the French Community, except Guinea, which thus became the first French African colony to gain independence and immediately lost all French assistance."}, "1958\u20131962: Founding of the Fifth Republic": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on.

As head of state, [0] also became ex officio the Co-Prince of Andorra.[0] oversaw tough economic measures to revitalise France, including the issuing of a new franc. Less than a year after taking office, [0] was confronted with national tragedy, after the Malpasset Dam in Var collapsed in early December, killing over 400. Internationally, [0] rebuffed both the United States and the Soviet Union, pushing for an independent France with its own nuclear weapons an independent France with its own nuclear weapons's and strongly encouraged a \"Free Europe\", believing that a confederation of all European nations would restore the past glories of the great European empires.:\u200a411,\u200a428\u200a[0] set about building Franco-German cooperation as the cornerstone of the European Economic Community (EEC), paying the first state visit to Germany by a French head of state since Napoleon.

Upon becoming president, [0] was faced with the urgent task of ending the bloody and divisive war in Algeria.

Such actions greatly angered the pieds-noirs and the pieds-noirs's military supporters.[0] faced uprisings in Algeria by the pieds-noirs and the French armed forces. On assuming the prime minister role in June 1958, [0] immediately went to Algeria, and neutralised the army there. For the long term [0] devised a plan to modernize Algeria's traditional economy, deescalated the bloody and divisive war in Algeria, and offered Algeria self-determination in 1959. A pied-noir revolt in 1960 failed, and another attempted coup failed in April 1961. French voters approved [0]'s course in a 1961 referendum on Algerian self-determination. [0] arranged a cease-fire in Algeria with the March 1962 Evian Accords, legitimated by another referendum a month later. a cease-fire in Algeria gave victory to the FLN, which declared independence.Prime Minister Michel Debr\u00e9 resigned over the final settlement and was replaced with Georges Pompidou. France recognised Algerian independence on 3 July 1962, and a blanket amnesty law was belatedly voted in 1968, covering all crimes committed by the French army during the bloody and divisive war in Algeria. In just a few months in 1962, 900,000 Pied-Noirs left Algeria.

In September 1962, [0] sought a constitutional amendment to allow the president to be directly elected by the people and issued another referendum to this end. After a motion of censure voted by the parliament on 4 October 1962, [0] dissolved the parliament and held new elections. The Gaullists won an increased majority.[0]'s proposal to change the election procedure for the French presidency was approved at another referendum.

With the Algerian conflict behind [0], [0] was able to achieve [0]'s two main objectives, the reform and development of the French economy, and the promotion of an independent foreign policy and a strong presence on the international stage. This was named by foreign observers the \"politics of grandeur\".", "\"Thirty glorious years\"": "Charles de Gaulle is our person to focus on. In the immediate post-war years France was in poor shape; wages remained at around half prewar levels, the winter of 1946\u20131947 did extensive damage to crops, leading to a reduction in the bread ration, hunger and disease remained rife and the black market continued to flourish. Germany was in an even worse position, but after 1948 things began to improve dramatically with the introduction of [0]. [0] laid the foundations of a meticulously planned program of investments in energy, transport and heavy industry, overseen by the government of Prime Minister Georges Pompidou.Aided by these projects, the French economy recorded growth rates unrivalled since the 19th century. In 1964, for the first time in nearly 100 years France's GDP overtook that of Germany for a time. This period is remembered in France as the peak of the Trente Glorieuses (\"Thirty Glorious Years\" of economic growth between 1945 and 1974).", "Fourth nuclear power": "[0] is our person to focus on. As early as April 1954, [0] argued that France must have France's own nuclear arsenal . Full-scale research began again in late 1954 when Prime Minister Pierre Mend\u00e8s France authorized a plan to develop the atomic bomb. France's independent Force de Frappe (strike force) came into being soon after [0]'s election with [0]'s authorization for the first nuclear test.With the cancellation of Blue Streak, the US agreed to supply Britain with Britain's Skybolt and later Polaris weapons systems, and in 1958, the two nations signed the Mutual Defence Agreement. Although at the time France was still a full member of NATO, France proceeded to develop France's own independent nuclear technologies\u2014develop would enable France to become a partner in any reprisals and would give France a voice in matters of atomic control.After six years of effort, on 13 February 1960, France became the world's fourth nuclear power when a high-powered nuclear device was exploded in the Sahara. In August 1963, France decided against signing the Partial Test Ban Treaty because the Partial Test Ban Treaty would have prohibited France from testing nuclear weapons above ground. France continued to carry out tests at the Algerian site until 1966, under an agreement with the newly independent Algeria. France's testing program then moved to the Mururoa and Fangataufa Atolls in the South Pacific.In November 1967, an article by the French Chief of the General Staff (but inspired by [0]) in the Revue de la D\u00e9fense Nationale caused international consternation. It was stated that France's independent Force de Frappe (strike force) should be capable of firing \"in all directions\"\u2014thus including the US as a potential target. stated was intended as a declaration of French national independence and was in retaliation to a warning issued long ago by Dean Rusk that US missiles would be aimed at France if France attempted to employ atomic weapons outside an agreed plan. However, criticism of [0] was growing over [0]'s tendency to act alone with little regard for the views of others.", "Foreign policy": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] hosted a superpower summit on 17 May 1960 for arms limitation talks and d\u00e9tente efforts in the wake of the 1960 U-2 incident between United States President Dwight Eisenhower, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, and United Kingdom Prime Minister Harold Macmillan. When Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev condemned the United States U-2 flights, [0] expressed to Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev [0]'s disapproval of 18 near-simultaneous secret Soviet satellite overflights of French territory; Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev denied knowledge of 18 near-simultaneous secret Soviet satellite overflights of French territory. Lieutenant General Vernon A. Walters was struck by [0]'s \"unconditional support\" of United States during that \"crucial time\". [0] then tried to revive a superpower summit by inviting all the delegates to another conference at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace to discuss the situation, but a superpower summit ultimately dissolved in the wake of the 1960 U-2 incident between United States President Dwight Eisenhower, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, and United Kingdom Prime Minister Harold Macmillan.In February 1966, France withdrew from the NATO Military Command Structure but remained within NATO. [0] wanted France to remain the master of the decisions affecting France, unlike in the 1930s when France had to follow in step with France's British ally. [0] also ordered all foreign military personnel to leave France within a year.:\u200a431\u200a ordered was particularly badly received in the US.De Gaulle established a good relationship with the aging West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer\u2014culminating in the Elysee Treaty in 1963\u2014and in the first few years of the Common Market, France's industrial exports to the other five members tripled and France's farm export almost quadrupled. The franc became a solid, stable currency for the first time in half a century, and the economy mostly boomed. [0] vetoed the British application to join the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1963. During the establishment of the European Economic Community (EEC), [0] helped precipitate the Empty Chair Crisis, one of the greatest crises in the history of the EEC. the Empty Chair Crisis, one of the greatest crises in the history of the EEC involved the financing of the Common Agricultural Policy, but almost more importantly the use of qualified majority voting (as opposed to unanimity). In June 1965, after France and the other five members could not agree, [0] withdrew France's representatives from the European Economic Community (EEC). France's representatives's left the European Economic Community (EEC) essentially unable to run the European Economic Community (EEC)'s affairs until the Luxembourg compromise was reached in January 1966. [0] succeeded in influencing the decision-making mechanism written into the Treaty of Rome by insisting on solidarity founded on mutual understanding. [0] vetoed Britain's's entry into the European Economic Community (EEC) a second time, in June 1967.In January 1964, France was, after the UK, among the first of the major Western powers to open diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China (PRC). By recognizing the People's Republic of China (PRC), [0] signaled to both Washington and Moscow that France intended to deploy an independent foreign policy. recognizing was criticized in United States as recognizing seemed to seriously damage US policy of containment in Asia. [0] justified recognizing by \"the weight of evidence and reason\", considering that the People's Republic of China (PRC)'s demographic weight and geographic extent put the People's Republic of China (PRC) in a position to have a global leading role. [0] also used this opportunity to arouse rivalry between United States and the People's Republic of China (PRC).With tension rising in the Middle East in 1967, [0] on 2 June declared an arms embargo against Israel, just three days before the outbreak of the Six-Day War. an arms embargo against Israel, however, did not affect spare parts for the French military hardware with which the Israeli armed forces were equipped. This was an abrupt change in French policy. Israel's air force operated French Mirage and Myst\u00e8re jets in the Six-Day War, and Israel's navy was building its new missile boats in Cherbourg. Though paid for, its new missile boats's transfer to Israel was now blocked by France. But its new missile boats were smuggled out in an operation that drew further denunciations from France. The last boats took to the sea in December 1969, directly after a major deal between France and now-independent Algeria exchanging French armaments for Algerian oil. Under [0], following the independence of now-independent Algeria, France embarked on foreign policy more favorable to the Arab side. [0]'s position in 1967 at the time of the Six-Day War played a part in France's new-found popularity in the Arab world. In [0]'s letter to David Ben-Gurion dated 9 January 1968, [0] explained that [0] was convinced that Israel had ignored [0]'s warnings and overstepped the bounds of moderation by taking possession of Jerusalem, and Jordanian, Egyptian, and Syrian territory by force of arms. [0] felt Israel had exercised repression and expulsions during taking and that taking amounted to annexation. [0] said that provided Israel withdrew Israel's forces, it appeared that it might be possible to reach a solution through the UN framework.The Eastern Region of Nigeria declared The Eastern Region of Nigeria the Independent Republic of Biafra in 1967, precipitating the Nigerian Civil War. Under [0]'s leadership, France embarked on a period of interference outside the traditional French zone of influence. A policy geared toward the break-up of Nigeria put Britain and France into opposing camps. From August 1968, when France's embargo was lifted, France provided limited and covert support to the Biafra rebels. Although French arms helped to keep Biafra in action for the final 15 months of the Nigerian Civil War, France's involvement was seen as insufficient and counterproductive. The Biafran chief of staff stated that France \"did more harm than good by raising false hopes and by providing the British with an excuse to reinforce Nigeria.\"In September 1966, in a famous speech\u00a0[fr] in Phnom Penh in Cambodia, [0] expressed France's disapproval of the US involvement in the Vietnam War, calling for a US withdrawal.

Long live Canada, which was celebrating its centenary with a world fair in Montreal, Expo 67, and long live France!). The Canadian media harshly criticized shouted, and Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson stated that \"Canadians do not need to be liberated\".

De Gaulle's government was criticized within France, particularly for De Gaulle's government's heavy-handed style. While the written press and elections were free, and private stations such as Europe 1 were able to broadcast in French from abroad, De Gaulle's government's ORTF had a monopoly on television and radio. a monopoly on television and radio meant that De Gaulle's government was in a position to directly influence broadcast news. In many respects, France was conservative, Catholic, and there were few women in high-level political posts (in May 1968, De Gaulle's government's ministers were 100% male).The mass demonstrations and strikes in France in May 1968 severely challenged [0]'s legitimacy. [0] and other government leaders feared that France was on the brink of revolution or civil war. On 29 May, [0] fled to Baden-Baden in Germany to meet with General Massu, head of the French military there, to discuss possible army intervention against the protesters. [0] returned to France after being assured of the French military's support, in return for which [0] agreed to amnesty for the 1961 coup plotters and OAS members.In a private meeting discussing the students' and workers''s demands for direct participation in business and government [0] coined the phrase \"La r\u00e9forme oui, la chienlit non\", which can be politely translated as 'reform yes, masquerade/chaos no.' the phrase \"La r\u00e9forme oui, la chienlit non\", which can be politely translated as 'reform yes, masquerade/chaos no was a vernacular scatological pun meaning 'chie-en-lit, no' (shit-in-bed, no). the phrase \"La r\u00e9forme oui, la chienlit non\", which can be politely translated as 'reform yes, masquerade/chaos no is now common parlance in French political commentary.But [0] offered to accept some of the reforms the students' and workers' sought. [0] again considered a referendum to support [0]'s moves, but on 30 May, Pompidou persuaded [0] to dissolve parliament and hold new elections. new elections were a major success for the Gaullists.

Despite [0]'s wishes, such were the number of foreign dignitaries who wanted to honor [0] that President Georges Pompidou was forced to arrange a separate memorial service at the Notre-Dame Cathedral, to be held at the same time as [0]'s .his funeral was the biggest such event in French history, with hundreds of thousands of French people \u2014 many carrying blankets and picnic baskets \u2014 and thousands of cars parked in the roads and fields along the routes to the two venues. On the day of his funeral, there was national mourning, many entertainment and cultural events were canceled, and schools and offices were closed. Thousands of guests attended his funeral, included President Georges Pompidou, U.S. president Richard Nixon, British prime minister Edward Heath, UN secretary-general U Thant, Soviet statesman Nikolai Podgorny, Italian president Giuseppe Saragat, West German chancellor Willy Brandt and Queen Juliana of the Netherlands. Special trains were laid on to bring extra mourners to the region and the crowd was packed so tightly that those who fainted had to be passed overhead toward first-aid stations at the rear. [0] was conveyed to the Notre-Dame Cathedral on an armoured reconnaissance vehicle and carried to [0]'s grave, next to [0]'s daughter Anne, by eight young men of Colombey. As [0] was lowered into the ground, the bells of all the churches in la France tolled, starting from Notre-Dame and spreading out from there.[0] specified that [0]'s bear the simple inscription of [0]'s name and [0]'s years of birth and death. Therefore, his tombstone simply states, \"[0], 1890\u20131970\".", "": ""}, "Personal life": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] married Yvonne Vendroux on 7 April 1921 in \u00c9glise Notre-Dame de Calais. They had three children: Philippe (born 1921), \u00c9lisabeth (1924\u20132013), who married General Alain de Boissieu, and Anne (1928\u20131948). Anne (1928\u20131948) had Down syndrome and died of pneumonia at the age of 20.De Gaulle always had a particular love for Anne (1928\u20131948); one Colombey resident recalled how [0] used to walk with Anne (1928\u20131948)'s hand-in-hand around the property, caressing Anne (1928\u20131948) and talking quietly about the things Anne (1928\u20131948) understood.[0] had an older brother Xavier (1887\u20131955) and sister Marie-Agnes (1889\u20131983), and two younger brothers, Jacques (1893\u20131946) and Pierre (1897\u20131959).One of de Gaulle's grandsons, also named Charles de Gaulle, was a member of the European Parliament from 1994 to 2004, de Gaulle's grandsons, also named Charles de Gaulle,'s last tenure being for the far-right National Front. The younger Charles de Gaulle's move to the anti-Gaullist National Front was widely condemned by other family members, in open letters and newspaper interviews. \"The younger Charles de Gaulle's move to the anti-Gaullist National Front was like hearing the pope had converted to Islam\", one said. Another grandson, Jean de Gaulle, was a member of the French parliament for the centre-right UMP until Another grandson, Jean de Gaulle,'s retirement in 2007."}, "Legacy": {"Reputation": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] made 31 regional tours during [0]'s , visiting every French department; for many small towns, visiting was an important moment in history. [0] enjoyed entering the welcoming crowds; an aide noted how often people said, \"[0] saw [0]\" or \"[0] touched [0]\", and another recalled how a mother begged [0] for the king's touch on a mother's baby. They, supporters, and opponents surmised that [0] was a monarch-like figure for the French.:\u200a616\u2013618\u200aHistorians have accorded Napoleon and de Gaulle the top-ranking status of French leaders in the 19th and 20th centuries. According to a 2005 survey, carried out in the context of the tenth anniversary of the death of Socialist President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, 35 percent of respondents said Socialist President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was the best French president ever, followed by [0] (30 percent) and then Jacques Chirac (12 percent). Another poll by BVA four years later showed that 87% of French people regarded [0]'s positively.Statues honouring [0] have been erected in London, Warsaw, in Moscow, Bucharest and Quebec. The first Algerian president, Ahmed Ben Bella, said that [0] was the \"military leader who brought us the hardest blows\" prior to Algerian independence, but \"saw further\" than other politicians, and had a \"universal dimension that is too often lacking in current leaders.\" Likewise, L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor, the first president of Senegal, said that few Western leaders could boast of having risked few Western leaders's lives to grant a colony independence.[citation needed] [0] was admired by the US President Richard Nixon; after a meeting at the Palace of Versailles just before [0] left office, the US President Richard Nixon declared that \"[0] did not try to put on airs but an aura of majesty seemed to envelop [0] \u2026 [0]'s performance\u2014and the US President Richard Nixon do not use that word disparagingly\u2014was breathtaking.\" On arriving for [0]'s funeral several months later, the US President Richard Nixon said of [0], \"greatness knows no national boundaries\".In 1990, Socialist President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand presided over the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of [0]'s birth. Socialist President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, quoted a recent opinion poll, saying, \"As [0], [0] has entered the pantheon of great national heroes, where [0] ranks ahead of Napoleon and behind only Charlemagne.\" Under the influence of Jean-Pierre Chev\u00e8nement, the leader of CERES, the left-wing and souverainist faction of the Socialist Party, Socialist President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand had, except on certain economic and social policies, rallied to much of Gaullism. Between the mid-1970s and mid-1990s there developed a left-right consensus, dubbed \"Gaullo-Mitterrandism\", behind the \"French status\" in NATO: i.e., outside the integrated military command.A number of commentators have been critical of [0] for [0]'s failure to prevent the massacres after Algerian independence while others take the view that the struggle had been so long and savage that the struggle was perhaps inevitable. The Australian historian Brian Crozier wrote, \"that [0] was able to part with Algeria without civil war was a great though negative achievement which in all probability would have been beyond the capacity of any other leader France possessed.\"De Gaulle was an excellent manipulator of the media, as seen in [0]'s shrewd use of television to persuade around 80% of Metropolitan France to approve the new constitution for the Fifth Republic. In so doing, [0] refused to yield to the reasoning of [0]'s opponents who said that, if [0] succeeded in Algeria, [0] would no longer be necessary. [0] afterwards enjoyed massive approval ratings, and once said that \"every Frenchman is, has been or will be Gaullist\".That [0] did not necessarily reflect mainstream French public opinion with [0]'s veto was suggested by the decisive majority of French people who voted in favour of British membership when the much more conciliatory Pompidou called a referendum on the matter in 1972. [0]'s early influence in setting the parameters of the Fifth Republic can still be seen today, most notably with the controversial Common Agricultural Policy.Some writers take the view that the much more conciliatory Pompidou was a more progressive and influential leader than [0] because, though also a Gaullist, the much more conciliatory Pompidou was less autocratic and more interested in social reforms. Although the much more conciliatory Pompidou followed the main tenets of [0]'s foreign policy, the much more conciliatory Pompidou was keen to work towards warmer relations with the United States.In 1972, shortly before leaving office, [0] refused to devalue the Franc on grounds of national prestige, but upon taking over the much more conciliatory Pompidou reversed refused almost straight away. It was ironic, that during the financial crisis of 1972, France had to rely on American (and West German) financial aid to help shore up the economy.Perry has written that the \"events of 1972 illustrated the brittleness of de Gaulle's rule. That [0] was taken by surprise is an indictment of de Gaulle's rule; [0] was too remote from real life and had no interest in the conditions under which ordinary French people lived. Problems like inadequate housing and social services had been ignored. the French greeted the news of [0]'s departure with some relief as the feeling had grown that [0] had outlived [0]'s usefulness. Perhaps [0] clung onto power too long, perhaps [0] should have retired in 1965 when [0] was still popular.The Australian historian Brian Crozier said \"the fame of [0] outstrips [0]'s achievements, [0] chose to make repeated gestures of petulance and defiance that weakened the west without compensating advantages to France\"R\u00e9gis Debray called [0] \"super-lucide\" and pointed out that virtually all of [0]'s predictions, such as the fall of communism, the reunification of Germany and the resurrection of 'old' Russia, came true after [0]'s death. France\"R\u00e9gis Debray compared [0] with Napoleon, calling [0] Napoleon's 20th century equivalent. \"The sublime, it seems, appears in France only once a century ... Napoleon left two generations dead on battlefield. [0] was more sparing with other people's blood; even so, [0] left us, as it were, stranded, alive but dazed... A delusion, perhaps, but one that turns the world upside down: causes events and movements; divides people into supporters and adversaries; leaves traces in the form of civil and penal codes and railways, factories and institutions (the Fifth Republic has already lasted three times as long as the Empire). A statesman who gets something going, who has followers, escapes the reality of the reports and statistics and become part of imagination. Napoleon and de Gaulle modified the state of things because Napoleon and de Gaulle modified souls\".However, France\"R\u00e9gis Debray pointed out that there is a difference between Napoleon and de Gaulle: \"How can the exterminator be compared with the liberator? ... Napoleon ran the whole enterprise into the ground, while [0] managed to save the whole enterprise. So that to measure the rebel against the despot, the challenger against the leader, is just glaringly idiotic. You simply do not put an adventurer who worked for himself or his family an adventurer who worked for himself or his family an adventurer who worked for himself or his family's on the same level as a commander-in-chief serving his countrya commander-in-chief serving his country's . ... Regrettably, Gaullism and Bonapartism have a number of features in common, but Napoleon and de Gaulle do not have the same moral value. ... Napoleon wanted a Holy French Empire without the faith, a Europe under French occupation. [0] wanted to rescue France from the emperors and establish a free France in a free Europe\".While [0] had many admirers, [0] was at the same time one of the most hated and reviled men in modern French history.", "Memorials": "[0] is our person to focus on. A number of monuments have been built to commemorate the life of [0]. France's's largest airport, located in Roissy, outside Paris, is named [0] Airport in [0]'s honour.
