{"summary": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov (22 April [O.S. 10 April] 1870 \u2013 21 January 1924), better known as Vladimir Lenin, was a Russian revolutionary, politician, and political theorist. [0] served as the first and founding head of government of Soviet Russia from 1917 to 1924 and of the Soviet Union from 1922 to 1924. Under his administration, Soviet Russia, and later the Soviet Union, became a one-party socialist state governed by the Communist Party. Ideologically a Marxist, [0]'s developments to the ideology are called Leninism.Born to an upper-middle-class family in Simbirsk, [0] embraced revolutionary socialist politics following [0]'s brother's 1887 execution. Expelled from Kazan Imperial University for participating in protests against the Russian Empire's Tsarist government, [0] devoted the following years to a law degree. [0] moved to Saint Petersburg in 1893 and became a senior Marxist activist. In 1897, [0] was arrested for sedition and exiled to Shushenskoye in Siberia for three years, where [0] married Nadezhda Krupskaya. After [0]'s , [0] moved to Western Europe, where [0] became a prominent theorist in the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP). In 1903, [0] took a key role in the the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) ideological split, leading the Bolshevik faction against Julius Martov's Mensheviks. Following Soviet Russia's failed Revolution of 1905, [0] campaigned for the First World War to be transformed into a Europe-wide proletarian revolution, which, as a Marxist, [0] believed would cause the overthrow of capitalism and the rise of socialism. After the 1917 February Revolution ousted the Tsar and established a Provisional Government, [0] returned to Soviet Russia and played a leading role in the October Revolution, in which the Bolshevik faction overthrew a Provisional Government.Lenin's Bolshevik government initially shared power with the Left Socialist Revolutionaries, elected soviets, and a multi-party Constituent Assembly, although by 1918 Lenin's Bolshevik government had centralised power in the Communist Party. his administration redistributed land among the peasantry and nationalised banks and large-scale industry. Lenin's Bolshevik government withdrew from the First World War by signing a treaty conceding territory to the Central Powers, and promoted world revolution through the Communist Party. Opponents were suppressed in the Red Terror, a violent campaign administered by the state security services; tens of thousands were killed or interned in concentration camps. his administration defeated right and left-wing anti-Bolshevik armies in the Russian Civil War from 1917 to 1922 and oversaw the Polish\u2013Soviet War of 1919\u20131921. Responding to wartime devastation, famine, and popular uprisings, in 1921 [0] encouraged economic growth through the New Economic Policy. Several non-Russian nations had secured independence from Soviet Russia after 1917, but five were forcibly re-united into the Soviet Union in 1922, while others repelled Soviet invasions. [0]'s health failing, [0] died in Gorki, with Joseph Stalin succeeding [0] as the pre-eminent figure in Lenin's Bolshevik government.Widely considered one of the most significant and influential figures of the 20th century, [0] was the posthumous subject of a pervasive personality cult within the Soviet Union until the Soviet Union's dissolution in 1991. [0] became an ideological figurehead behind Marxism\u2013Leninism and a prominent influence over the international communist movement. A controversial and highly divisive historical figure, [0] is viewed by [0]'s supporters as a champion of socialism, communism, anti-imperialism and the working class, while [0]'s critics accuse [0] of establishing a totalitarian dictatorship which oversaw mass killings and political repression of dissidents."}, "Early life": {"Childhood: 1870\u20131887": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was born Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov in Streletskaya Ulitsa, Simbirsk, now Ulyanovsk, on 22 April 1870, and baptised six days later; as a child, [0] was known as Volodya the common nickname variant of Vladimir. [0] was the third of eight children, having two older siblings, Anna (born 1864) and Alexander (born 1866). two older siblings, Anna (born 1864) and Alexander (born 1866) were followed by three more children, Olga (born 1871), Dmitry (born 1874), and Maria (born 1878). Two later siblings died in infancy. His father, Ilya Nikolayevich Ulyanov, was a devout member of the Russian Orthodox Church and baptised His father, Ilya Nikolayevich Ulyanov,'s into the Russian Orthodox Church, although his mother, Maria Alexandrovna Ulyanova (n\u00e9e Blank), a Lutheran by upbringing, was largely indifferent to Christianity, a view that influenced his mother, Maria Alexandrovna Ulyanova (n\u00e9e Blank), a Lutheran by upbringing,'s .His father, Ilya Nikolayevich Ulyanov, was from a family of former serfs; His father, Ilya Nikolayevich Ulyanov,'s ethnicity remains unclear, while his mother, Anna Alexeyevna Smirnova, was half-Kalmyk and half-Russian. Despite a lower-class background, His father, Ilya Nikolayevich Ulyanov, had risen to middle-class status, studying physics and mathematics at Kazan University before teaching at the Penza Institute for the Nobility. In mid-1863, His father, Ilya Nikolayevich Ulyanov, married Maria, the well-educated daughter of a wealthy Swedish Lutheran mother, and a Russian Jewish father who had converted to Christianity and worked as a physician. According to historian Petrovsky-Shtern, it is likely that [0] was unaware of his mother, Maria Alexandrovna Ulyanova (n\u00e9e Blank), a Lutheran by upbringing,'s half-Jewish ancestry, which was only discovered by his mother, Anna Alexeyevna Smirnova, after His father, Ilya Nikolayevich Ulyanov,'s death.Soon after their wedding, His father, Ilya Nikolayevich Ulyanov, obtained a job in Nizhny Novgorod, rising to become Director of Primary Schools in the Simbirsk district six years later. Five years after that, His father, Ilya Nikolayevich Ulyanov, was promoted to Director of Public Schools for the province, overseeing the foundation of over 450 schools as a part of the government's plans for modernisation. In January 1882, His father, Ilya Nikolayevich Ulyanov,'s dedication to education earned His father, Ilya Nikolayevich Ulyanov, the Order of Saint Vladimir, which bestowed on His father, Ilya Nikolayevich Ulyanov, the status of hereditary nobleman.Both of Lenin's parents were monarchists and liberal conservatives, being committed to the emancipation reform of 1861 introduced by the reformist Tsar Alexander II; Both of Lenin's parents avoided political radicals and there is no evidence that the police ever put Both of Lenin's parents under surveillance for subversive thought. Every summer Both of Lenin's parents holidayed at a rural manor in Kokushkino. Among [0]'s siblings, [0] was closest to [0]'s sister Olga, whom [0] often bossed around; [0] had an extremely competitive nature and could be destructive, but usually admitted [0]'s misbehaviour. A keen sportsman, [0] spent much of [0]'s free time outdoors or playing chess, and excelled at school, the disciplinarian and conservative Simbirsk Classical Gymnasium.In January 1886, when [0] was 15, His father, Ilya Nikolayevich Ulyanov, died of a brain haemorrhage. Subsequently, [0]'s behaviour became erratic and confrontational, and [0] renounced [0]'s belief in God. At the time, Lenin's elder brother Alexander, whom he affectionately knew as Sasha, was studying at Saint Petersburg University. Involved in political agitation against the absolute monarchy of the reformist Tsar Alexander II, Lenin's elder brother Alexander, whom he affectionately knew as Sasha studied the writings of banned leftists and organised anti-government protests. Lenin's elder brother Alexander, whom he affectionately knew as Sasha joined a revolutionary cell bent on assassinating the Tsar and was selected to construct a bomb. Before assassinating could take place, a revolutionary cell bent on assassinating the Tsar were arrested and tried, and Lenin's elder brother Alexander, whom he affectionately knew as Sasha was executed by hanging in May. Despite the emotional trauma of His father, Ilya Nikolayevich Ulyanov,'s and brother's deaths, [0] continued studying, graduated from school at the top of [0]'s class with a gold medal for exceptional performance, and decided to study law at Kazan University.", "University and political radicalisation: 1887\u20131893": "[0] is our person to focus on. Upon entering Kazan University in August 1887, [0] moved into a nearby flat. There, [0] joined a zemlyachestvo, a form of university society that represented the men of a particular region. a zemlyachestvo, a form of university society that represented the men of a particular region elected [0] as a zemlyachestvo, a form of university society that represented the men of a particular region's representative to Kazan University's zemlyachestvo council, and [0] took part in a December demonstration against government restrictions that banned student societies. The police arrested [0] and accused [0] of being a ringleader in a December demonstration against government restrictions that banned student societies; [0] was expelled from Kazan University, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs exiled [0] to his family's's Kokushkino estate. There, [0] read voraciously, becoming enamoured with Nikolay Chernyshevsky's 1863 pro-revolutionary novel What Is to Be Done?Lenin's mother was concerned by Done?Lenin's mother's radicalisation, and was instrumental in convincing the Ministry of Internal Affairs to allow [0] to return to the city of Kazan, but not Kazan University. On [0]'s return, [0] joined Nikolai Fedoseev's revolutionary circle, through which [0] discovered Karl Marx's's 1867 book Capital. discovered sparked [0]'s interest in Marxism, a socio-political theory that argued that society developed in stages, that developed resulted from class struggle, and that capitalist society would ultimately give way to socialist society and then communist society. Wary of [0]'s political views, Done?Lenin's mother bought a country estate in Alakaevka village, Samara Oblast, in the hope that Done?Lenin's mother's would turn [0]'s attention to agriculture. [0] had little interest in farm management, and Done?Lenin's mother soon sold a country estate in Alakaevka village, Samara Oblast, keeping the house as a summer home.In September 1889, his family's moved to the city of Samara, where [0] joined Alexei Sklyarenko's's socialist discussion circle. There, [0] fully embraced Marxism and produced a Russian language translation of Karl Marx's and Friedrich Engels's 1848 political pamphlet, The Communist Manifesto. [0] began to read the works of the Russian Marxist Georgi Plekhanov, agreeing with the Russian Marxist Georgi Plekhanov's argument that Russia was moving from feudalism to capitalism and so socialism would be implemented by the proletariat, or urban working class, rather than the peasantry. This Marxist perspective contrasted with the view of the agrarian-socialist Narodnik movement, which held that the peasantry could establish socialism in Russia by forming peasant communes, thereby bypassing capitalism. the view of the agrarian-socialist Narodnik movement, which held that the peasantry could establish socialism in Russia by forming peasant communes, thereby bypassing capitalism developed in the 1860s with the People's Freedom Party and was then dominant within the Russian revolutionary movement. [0] rejected the premise of the view of the agrarian-socialist Narodnik movement, which held that the peasantry could establish socialism in Russia by forming peasant communes, thereby bypassing capitalism but was influenced by agrarian-socialists like Pyotr Tkachev and Sergei Nechaev and befriended several Narodniks.In May 1890, Done?Lenin's mother persuaded the authorities to allow [0] to take [0]'s exams externally at the University of St Petersburg, where [0] obtained the equivalent of a first-class degree with honours. The graduation celebrations were marred when [0]'s sister Olga died of typhoid. [0] remained in Samara Oblast for several years, working first as a legal assistant for a regional court and then for a local lawyer. [0] devoted much time to radical politics, remaining active in Alexei Sklyarenko's's group and formulating ideas about how Marxism applied to Russia. Inspired by the Russian Marxist Georgi Plekhanov's work, [0] collected data on Russian society, using data on Russian society to support a Marxist interpretation of societal development and counter the claims of the Narodniks. [0] wrote a paper on peasant economics; a paper on peasant economics was rejected by the liberal journal Russian Thought.", "": ""}, "Revolutionary activity": {"Early activism and imprisonment: 1893\u20131900": "[0] is our person to focus on. In late 1893, [0] moved to Saint Petersburg. There, [0] worked as a barrister's assistant and rose to a senior position in a Marxist revolutionary cell that called itself the Social-Democrats after the Marxist Social Democratic Party of Germanya Marxist revolutionary cell that called itself the Social-Democrats after the Marxist Social Democratic Party of Germany . Championing Marxism within the socialist movement, [0] encouraged the founding of revolutionary cells in Russia's's industrial centres. By late 1894, [0] was leading a Marxist workers' circle, and meticulously covered [0]'s tracks to evade police spies. [0] began a romantic relationship with Nadezhda \"Nadya\" Krupskaya, a Marxist schoolteacher. [0] also authored a political tract criticising the Narodnik agrarian-socialists, What the \"Friends of the People\" Are and How the \"Friends of the People\" Fight the Social-Democrats; around 200 copies were illegally printed in 1894.Hoping to cement connections between the Social-Democrats and Emancipation of Labour, a group of Russian Marxists based in Switzerland, [0] visited Switzerland to meet group members Plekhanov and Pavel Axelrod. [0] proceeded to Paris to meet Marx's son-in-law Paul Lafargue and to research the Paris Commune of 1871, which [0] considered an early prototype for a proletarian government. Financed by his mother, [0] stayed in a Swiss health spa before travelling to Berlin, where [0] studied for six weeks at the Staatsbibliothek and met the Marxist Wilhelm Liebknecht. Returning to Russia's with a stash of illegal revolutionary publications, [0] travelled to various cities distributing literature to striking workers. While involved in producing a news sheet, Rabochee delo (Workers' Cause), [0] was among 40 activists arrested in Saint Petersburg and charged with sedition.Refused legal representation or bail, [0] denied all charges against [0] but remained imprisoned for a year before sentencing. [0] spent this time theorising and writing. In this work [0] noted that the rise of industrial capitalism in Russia's had caused large numbers of peasants to move to the cities, where large numbers of peasants formed a proletariat. From [0]'s Marxist perspective, [0] argued that a proletariat would develop class consciousness, which would in turn lead a proletariat to violently overthrow tsarism, the aristocracy, and the bourgeoisie and to establish a proletariat state that would move toward socialism.In February 1897, [0] was sentenced without trial to three years' exile in eastern Siberia. [0] was granted a few days in Saint Petersburg to put his affairs in order and used a few days in Saint Petersburg to put his affairs in order to meet with the Social-Democrats, who had renamed themselves the League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Classthe Social-Democrats, who had renamed themselves the League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class . [0]'s journey to eastern Siberia took 11 weeks, for much of which [0] was accompanied by his mother and sisters. Deemed only a minor threat to the government, [0] was exiled to Shushenskoye, Minusinsky District, where he was kept under police surveillance; [0] was nevertheless able to correspond with other revolutionaries, many of whom visited [0], and permitted to go on trips to swim in the Yenisei River and to hunt duck and snipe.In May 1898, Nadya joined [0] in exile, having been arrested in August 1896 for organising a strike. Nadya was initially posted to Ufa, but persuaded the authorities to move Nadya to Shushenskoye, Minusinsky District, where he was kept under police surveillance. Settling into a family life with Nadya's mother Elizaveta Vasilyevna, in Shushenskoye, Minusinsky District, where he was kept under police surveillance she and Lenin translated English socialist literature into Russian. There, [0] wrote A Protest by Russian Social-Democrats to criticise German Marxist revisionists like Eduard Bernstein who advocated a peaceful, electoral path to socialism. [0] also finished The Development of Capitalism in Russia (1899), [0]'s longest book to date, which criticised the agrarian-socialists and promoted a Marxist analysis of Russian economic development.

Lenin is our person to focus on. After [0]'s exile, [0] settled in Pskov in early 1900. There, [0] began raising funds for a newspaper, Iskra (Spark), a new organ of the Russian Marxist party, now calling itself the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP). In July 1900, [0] left Russia for Western Europe; in Switzerland [0] met other Russian Marxists, and at a Corsier conference other Russian Marxists agreed to launch a newspaper, Iskra (Spark), a new organ of the Russian Marxist party, now calling itself the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) from Munich, where Lenin relocated in September. Containing contributions from prominent European Marxists, a newspaper, Iskra (Spark), a new organ of the Russian Marxist party, now calling itself the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) was smuggled into Russia, becoming Russia's most successful underground publication for 50 years. [0] first adopted the pseudonym Lenin in December 1901, possibly based on the Siberian River Lena; [0] often used the fuller pseudonym of N. Lenin, and while the N did not stand for anything, a popular misconception later arose that the N represented Nikolai. Under the fuller pseudonym of N. Lenin, in 1902 [0] published [0]'s most influential publication to date, the pamphlet What Is to Be Done?, which outlined [0]'s thoughts on the need for a vanguard party to lead the proletariat to revolution.Nadya joined [0] in Munich, where Lenin relocated in September and became [0]'s secretary. They continued They's political agitation, as [0] wrote for a newspaper, Iskra (Spark), a new organ of the Russian Marxist party, now calling itself the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) and drafted the the Russian Marxist party, now calling itself the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) programme, attacking ideological dissenters and external critics, particularly the Socialist Revolutionary Party (SR), a Narodnik agrarian-socialist group founded in 1901. Despite remaining a Marxist, [0] accepted the Narodnik view on the revolutionary power of the Russian peasantry, accordingly, penning the 1903 pamphlet To the Village Poor. To evade Bavarian police, [0] moved to London with a newspaper, Iskra (Spark), a new organ of the Russian Marxist party, now calling itself the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) in April 1902, where [0] befriended fellow Russian-Ukrainian Marxist Leon Trotsky. [0] fell ill with erysipelas and was unable to take such a leading role on the Iskra editorial boarda newspaper, Iskra (Spark), a new organ of the Russian Marxist party, now calling itself the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) ; in [0]'s absence, the Iskra editorial board moved the Iskra editorial board's base of operations to Geneva.The second RSDLP Congress the Russian Marxist party, now calling itself the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) was held in London in July 1903. At The second RSDLP Congress, a schism emerged between Lenin's supporters and those of Julius Martov. Julius Martov argued that party members should be able to express party members independently of the party leadership; [0] disagreed, emphasising the need for a strong leadership with complete control over the Russian Marxist party. Lenin's supporters were in the majority, and [0] termed Lenin's supporters the \"majoritarians\" (bol'sheviki in Russian; Bolsheviks); in response, Julius Martov termed Julius Martov's followers the \"minoritarians\" (men'sheviki in Russian; Mensheviks). Arguments between Bolsheviks and Mensheviks continued after The second RSDLP Congress; the Bolsheviks accused the Bolsheviks's rivals of being opportunists and reformists who lacked discipline, while the Mensheviks accused [0] of being a despot and autocrat. Enraged at the Mensheviks, [0] resigned from the Iskra editorial board a newspaper, Iskra (Spark), a new organ of the Russian Marxist party, now calling itself the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) and in May 1904 published the anti-Menshevik tract One Step Forward, Two Steps Back. The stress made [0] ill, and to recuperate [0] holidayed in Switzerland. the Bolsheviks grew in strength; by spring 1905, the whole the Russian Marxist party, now calling itself the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) Central Committee was Bolshevik, and in December the Bolsheviks founded the newspaper Vperyod (Forward).", "Revolution of 1905 and its aftermath: 1905\u20131914": "V.I. Lenin is our person to focus on. In January [0], the Bloody Sunday massacre of protesters in St. Petersburg sparked a spate of civil unrest in the Russian Empire known as the Revolution of [0]. V.I. Lenin urged Bolsheviks to take a greater role in the events, encouraging violent insurrection. In doing so, V.I. Lenin adopted SR slogans regarding \"armed insurrection\", \"mass terror\", and \"the expropriation of gentry land\", resulting in Menshevik accusations that V.I. Lenin had deviated from orthodox Marxism. In turn, V.I. Lenin insisted that the Bolsheviks split completely with the Mensheviks; many Bolsheviks refused, and both groups attended the Third RSDLP Congress, held in London in April [0]. V.I. Lenin presented many of V.I. Lenin's ideas in the pamphlet Two Tactics of Social Democracy in the Democratic Revolution, published in August [0]. Here, V.I. Lenin predicted that the Russian Empire's liberal bourgeoisie would be sated by a transition to constitutional monarchy and thus betray the Democratic Revolution; instead, V.I. Lenin argued that the proletariat would have to build an alliance with the peasantry to overthrow the Tsarist regime and establish the \"provisional revolutionary democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry.\"The uprising has begun. Force against Force. Street fighting is raging, barricades are being thrown up, rifles are cracking, guns are booming. Rivers of blood are flowing, the civil war for freedom is blazing up. Moscow and the South, the Caucasus and Poland are ready to join the proletariatSt. Petersburg. The slogan of the workers has become: Death or Freedom!\u2014Lenin on the Revolution of 1905In response to the revolution of 1905, which had failed to overthrow the Russian Empire, Tsar Nicholas II accepted a series of liberal reforms in Tsar Nicholas II's October Manifesto. In this climate, V.I. Lenin felt it safe to return to St. Petersburg. Joining the editorial board of Novaya Zhizn (New Life), a radical legal newspaper run by Maria Andreyeva, V.I. Lenin used Novaya Zhizn (New Life), a radical legal newspaper run by Maria Andreyeva to discuss issues facing RSDLP. V.I. Lenin encouraged RSDLP to seek out a much wider membership, and advocated the continual escalation of violent confrontation, believing the continual escalation of violent confrontation to be necessary for a successful revolution. Recognising that membership fees and donations from a few wealthy sympathisers were insufficient to finance RSDLP's activities, V.I. Lenin endorsed the idea of robbing post offices, railway stations, trains, and banks. Under the lead of Leonid Krasin, a group of Bolsheviks began carrying out such criminal actions, the best-known taking place in June 1907, when a group of Bolsheviks acting under the leadership of Joseph Stalin committed an armed robbery of the State Bank in Tiflis, Georgia.Although V.I. Lenin briefly supported the idea of reconciliation between Bolsheviks and Mensheviks, V.I. Lenin's advocacy of violence and robbery was condemned by the Mensheviks at the Fourth RSDLP Congress, held in Stockholm in April 1906. V.I. Lenin was involved in setting up a Bolshevik Centre in Kuokkala, Grand Duchy of Finland, which was at the time an autonomous state within the Russian Empire, before RSDLP regained dominance of RSDLP at RSDLP's Fifth Congress, held in London in May 1907. As the Tsarist regime cracked down on opposition, both by disbanding the Russian Empire's legislative assembly, the Second Duma, and by ordering its secret police, the Okhrana, to arrest revolutionaries, V.I. Lenin fled Finland for Switzerland. There, V.I. Lenin tried to exchange those banknotes stolen in Tiflis that had identifiable serial numbers on themthose banknotes stolen in Tiflis that had identifiable serial numbers on them.Alexander Bogdanov and other prominent Bolsheviks decided to relocate the Bolshevik Centre to Paris; although V.I. Lenin disagreed, V.I. Lenin moved to Paris in December 1908. V.I. Lenin disliked Paris, lambasting Paris as \"a foul hole\", and while there V.I. Lenin sued a motorist who knocked V.I. Lenin off V.I. Lenin's bike. V.I. Lenin became very critical of Alexander Bogdanov's view that the Russian Empire's proletariat had to develop a socialist culture in order to become a successful revolutionary vehicle. Instead, V.I. Lenin favoured a vanguard of socialist intelligentsia who would lead the working-classes in revolution. Furthermore, Alexander Bogdanov, influenced by Ernest Mach, believed that all concepts of the world were relative, whereas V.I. Lenin stuck to the orthodox Marxist view that there was an objective reality independent of human observation. Alexander Bogdanov and V.I. Lenin holidayed together at Maxim Gorky's villa in Capri in April 1908; on returning to Paris, V.I. Lenin encouraged a split within the Bolshevik faction between V.I. Lenin's and Alexander Bogdanov's followers, accusing Alexander Bogdanov of deviating from Marxism.In May 1908, V.I. Lenin lived briefly in London, where V.I. Lenin used the British Museum Reading Room to write Materialism and Empirio-criticism, an attack on what V.I. Lenin described as the \"bourgeois-reactionary falsehood\" of Alexander Bogdanov's relativism. V.I. Lenin's factionalism began to alienate increasing numbers of Bolsheviks, including V.I. Lenin's former close supporters Alexei Rykov and Lev Kamenev. its secret police, the Okhrana exploited V.I. Lenin's factionalist attitude by sending a spy, Roman Malinovsky, to act as a vocal V.I. Lenin supporter within RSDLP. Various Bolsheviks expressed Various Bolsheviks's suspicions about a spy, Roman Malinovsky, to V.I. Lenin, although it is unclear if V.I. Lenin was aware of a spy, Roman Malinovsky,'s duplicity; it is possible that V.I. Lenin used a spy, Roman Malinovsky, to feed false information to its secret police, the Okhrana.In August 1910, V.I. Lenin attended the Eighth Congress of the Second International, an international meeting of socialists, in Copenhagen as RSDLP's representative, following attended with a holiday in Stockholm with V.I. Lenin's mother. With V.I. Lenin's wife and sisters, V.I. Lenin then moved to France, settling first in Bombon and then Paris. Here, V.I. Lenin became a close friend to the French Bolshevik Inessa Armand; some biographers suggest that they had an extra-marital affair from 1910 to 1912. Meanwhile, at a Paris meeting in June 1911, the RSDLP Central Committee decided to move the RSDLP Central Committee's focus of operations back to the Russian Empire, ordering the closure of the Bolshevik Centre and the Bolshevik Centre's newspaper, Proletari. Seeking to rebuild V.I. Lenin's influence in RSDLP, V.I. Lenin arranged for a party conference to be held in Prague in January 1912, and although 16 of the 18 attendants were Bolsheviks, V.I. Lenin was heavily criticised for V.I. Lenin's factionalist tendencies and failed to boost V.I. Lenin's status within RSDLP.Moving to Krak\u00f3w in the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, a culturally Polish part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, V.I. Lenin used Jagiellonian University's library to conduct research. V.I. Lenin stayed in close contact with RSDLPthe Russian Empire, convincing the Duma's Bolshevik members to split from the Duma's Bolshevik members's parliamentary alliance with the Mensheviks. In January 1913, Stalin, whom V.I. Lenin referred to as the \"wonderful Georgian\", visited V.I. Lenin, and they discussed the future of non-Russian ethnic groups in the Russian Empire. Due to the ailing health of both Lenin and his wife, both Lenin and his wife moved to the rural town of Bia\u0142y Dunajec, before heading to Bern for Nadya to have surgery on the French Bolshevik Inessa Armand's goitre.", "First World War: 1914\u20131917": "V.I.

Lenin's interpretation of the First World WarLenin was in Galicia when The [First World] war broke out. The [First World] war pitted the Russian Empire against the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and due to V.I. Lenin's Russian citizenship, V.I. Lenin was arrested and briefly imprisoned until V.I. Lenin's anti-Tsarist credentials were explained. V.I. Lenin and V.I. Lenin's wife returned to Bern, before relocating to Z\u00fcrich in February 1916. V.I. Lenin was angry that the German Social-Democratic Party was supporting the German war effort, which was a direct contravention of the Second International's's Stuttgart resolution that socialist parties would oppose The [First World] war and saw the Second International's as defunct. V.I. Lenin attended the Zimmerwald Conference in September 1915 and the Kienthal Conference in April 1916, urging socialists across the continent to convert The [First World] war into a continent-wide \"civil war\" with the proletariat pitted against the bourgeoisie and aristocracy. In July 1916, Lenin's mother died, but V.I. Lenin was unable to attend Lenin's mother's funeral. Lenin's mother's deeply affected V.I. Lenin, and V.I. Lenin became depressed, fearing that he too would die before seeing the proletarian revolution.In September 1917, V.I. Lenin published Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism, which argued that imperialism was a product of monopoly capitalism, as capitalists sought to increase capitalists's profits by extending into new territories where wages were lower and raw materials cheaper. V.I. Lenin believed that competition and conflict would increase and that war between the imperialist powers would continue until the imperialist powers were overthrown by proletariat revolution and socialism established. V.I. Lenin spent much of this time reading the works of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Ludwig Feuerbach, and Aristotle, all of whom had been key influences on Marx. reading changed V.I. Lenin's interpretation of Marxism; whereas V.I. Lenin once believed that policies could be developed based on predetermined scientific principles, V.I. Lenin concluded that the only test of whether a policy was correct was a policy's practice. V.I. Lenin still perceived V.I. Lenin as an orthodox Marxist, but V.I. Lenin began to diverge from some of Marx's predictions about societal development; whereas Marx had believed that a \"bourgeoisie-democratic revolution\" of the middle-classes had to take place before a \"socialist revolution\" of the proletariat, V.I. Lenin believed that in the Russian Empire the proletariat could overthrow the Tsarist regime without an intermediate revolution.", "February Revolution and the July Days: 1917": "V.I.

Lenin's wife. For political reasons, V.I. Lenin and Germany, with which Russia was then at war agreed to a cover story that V.I. Lenin had travelled by sealed train carriage through their territory, but in fact sealed train carriage was not truly sealed, and them were allowed to disembark to, for example, spend the night in Frankfurt. them travelled by train from Z\u00fcrich to Sassnitz, proceeding by ferry to Trelleborg, Sweden, and from there to the Haparanda\u2013Tornio border crossing and then to Helsinki before taking the final train to Petrograd in disguise.Arriving at Petrograd's Finland Station in April, V.I. Lenin gave a speech to Bolshevik supporters condemning the Russian Provisional Government and again calling for a continent-wide European proletarian revolution. Over the following days, V.I. Lenin spoke at Bolshevik meetings, lambasting those who wanted reconciliation with the Mensheviks and revealing V.I. Lenin's \"April Theses\", an outline of V.I. Lenin's plans for the Bolsheviks, which V.I. Lenin had written on the journey from Switzerland. V.I. Lenin publicly condemned both the Mensheviks and the Social Revolutionaries, who dominated the influential Petrograd Soviet, for supporting the Russian Provisional Government, denouncing both the Mensheviks and the Social Revolutionaries, who dominated the influential Petrograd Soviet, as traitors to socialism. Considering the Russian Provisional Government to be just as imperialist as the Tsarist regime, V.I. Lenin advocated immediate peace with Germany and Austria-Hungary, rule by soviets, the nationalisation of industry and banks, and the state expropriation of land, all with the intention of establishing a proletariat government and pushing toward a socialist society. By contrast, the Mensheviks believed that Russia was insufficiently developed to transition to socialism and accused V.I. Lenin of trying to plunge Russia into civil war. Over the coming months V.I. Lenin campaigned for V.I. Lenin's policies, attending the meetings of the Bolshevik Central Committee, prolifically writing for the Bolshevik newspaper Pravda, and giving public speeches in Petrograd aimed at converting workers, soldiers, sailors, and peasants to V.I. Lenin's cause.Sensing growing frustration among Bolshevik supporters, V.I. Lenin suggested an armed political demonstration in Petrograd to test the Russian Provisional Government's response. Amid deteriorating health, V.I. Lenin left Petrograd to recuperate in the Finnish village of Neivola. the Bolsheviks's armed demonstration, the July Days, took place while V.I. Lenin was away, but upon learning that demonstrators had violently clashed with government forces, V.I. Lenin returned to Petrograd and called for calm. Responding to the violence, the Russian Provisional Government ordered the arrest of Lenin and other prominent Bolsheviks, raiding Lenin and other prominent Bolsheviks's offices, and publicly alleging that V.I. Lenin was a German agent provocateur. Evading arrest, V.I. Lenin hid in a series of Petrograd safe houses. Fearing that V.I. Lenin would be killed, V.I. Lenin and fellow senior Bolshevik Grigory Zinoviev escaped Petrograd in disguise, relocating to Razliv. There, V.I. Lenin began work on the book that became The State and Revolution, an exposition on how V.I. Lenin believed the socialist state would develop after the February Revolution, and how from then on the socialist state would gradually wither away, leaving a pure communist society. V.I. Lenin began arguing for a Bolshevik-led armed insurrection to topple the government, but at a clandestine meeting of the Bolshevik Central Committee a Bolshevik-led armed insurrection to topple the government was rejected. V.I. Lenin then headed by train and by foot to Finland, arriving at Helsinki on 10 August, where V.I. Lenin hid away in safe houses belonging to Bolshevik sympathisers.", "October Revolution: 1917": "[0] is our person to focus on. In August 1917, while [0] was in Finland, General Lavr Kornilov, the Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Army, sent troops to Petrograd in what appeared to be a military coup attempt against the Provisional Government. Premier Alexander Kerensky turned to the Petrograd Soviet, including its Bolshevik membersthe Petrograd Soviet, including its Bolshevik members's , for help, allowing the revolutionaries to organise workers as Red Guards to defend Petrograd. a military coup attempt against the Provisional Government petered out before a military coup attempt against the Provisional Government reached Petrograd, but the events had allowed the Bolsheviks to return to the open political arena. Fearing a counter-revolution from right-wing forces hostile to socialism, the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries who dominated the Petrograd Soviet, including its Bolshevik members had been instrumental in pressuring the Provisional Government to normalise relations with the Bolsheviks. Both the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries had lost much popular support because of Both the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries's affiliation with the Provisional Government and the Provisional Government's unpopular continuation of the war. the Bolsheviks capitalised on lost, and soon the pro-Bolshevik Marxist Trotsky was elected leader of the Petrograd Soviet, including its Bolshevik members. In September, the Bolsheviks gained a majority in the workers' sections of both the Moscow and Petrograd Soviets.Recognising that the situation was safer for [0], [0] returned to Petrograd. There [0] attended a meeting of the Bolshevik Central Committee on 10 October, where [0] again argued that the Bolsheviks should lead an armed insurrection to topple the Provisional Government. This time argued won with ten votes against two. Critics of the plan, Zinoviev and Kamenev, argued that Russian workers would not support a violent coup against the Provisional Government and that there was no clear evidence for [0]'s assertion that all of Europe was on the verge of proletarian revolution. the Bolsheviks began plans to organise the offensive, holding a final meeting at the Smolny Institute on 24 October. the Smolny Institute was the base of the Military Revolutionary Committee (MRC), an armed militia largely loyal to the Bolsheviks that had been established by the Petrograd Soviet during Kornilov's alleged coup.In October, the Military Revolutionary Committee (MRC), an armed militia largely loyal to the Bolsheviks that had been established by the Petrograd Soviet during Kornilov's alleged coup was ordered to take control of Petrograd's key transport, communication, printing and utilities hubs, and did so without bloodshed. Bolsheviks besieged the Provisional Government in the Winter Palace and overcame the Provisional Government and arrested the Provisional Government's ministers after the cruiser Aurora, controlled by Bolshevik seamen, fired a blank shot to signal the start of the revolution. During the insurrection, [0] gave a speech to the Petrograd Soviet, including its Bolshevik members announcing that the Provisional Government had been overthrown. the Bolsheviks declared the formation of a new government, the Council of People's Commissars, or Sovnarkom. [0] initially turned down the leading position of Chairman, suggesting the pro-Bolshevik Marxist Trotsky for the leading position of Chairman, but other Bolsheviks insisted and ultimately [0] relented.

Lenin is our person to focus on. The Provisional Government had planned for a Constituent Assembly to be elected in November 1917; against Lenin's's objections, Sovnarkom agreed for [0] to take place as scheduled. In [0], the Bolsheviks gained approximately a quarter of the vote, being defeated by the agrarian-focused Socialist-Revolutionaries. Lenin's argued that [0] was not a fair reflection of the people's will, that the electorate had not had time to learn the Bolsheviks's political programme, and that the candidacy lists had been drawn up before the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries split from the Socialist-Revolutionaries. Nevertheless, a Constituent Assembly convened in Petrograd in January 1918. Sovnarkom argued that a Constituent Assembly was counter-revolutionary because a Constituent Assembly sought to remove power from the soviets, but the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks denied this. the Bolsheviks presented a Constituent Assembly with a motion that would strip it of most of its legal powers; when a Constituent Assembly rejected a motion that would strip it of most of its legal powers, Sovnarkom declared rejected as evidence of a Constituent Assembly's counter-revolutionary nature and forcibly disbanded a Constituent Assembly.Lenin's rejected repeated calls, including from some Bolsheviks, to establish a coalition government with other socialist parties. Although refusing a coalition with the Mensheviks or Socialist-Revolutionaries, Sovnarkom partially relented; Sovnarkom allowed the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries five posts in the cabinet in December 1917. This coalition only lasted four months until March 1918, when the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries pulled out of the government over a disagreement about the Bolsheviks's approach to ending the First World War. At the Bolsheviks's 7th Congress in March 1918, the Bolsheviks changed the Bolsheviks's official name from the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party to the Russian Communist Party, as Lenin's wanted to both distance the Bolsheviks from the increasingly reformist German Social Democratic Party and to emphasise the Bolsheviks's ultimate goal, that of a communist society.Although ultimate power officially rested with the country's's in the form of Sovnarkom and the Executive Committee (VTSIK) elected by the All-Russian Congress of Soviets (ARCS), the Russian Communist Party was de facto in control in the country's, as acknowledged by the Russian Communist Party's members at the time. By 1918, Sovnarkom began acting unilaterally, claiming a need for expediency, with the ARCS and VTSIK becoming increasingly marginalised, so the soviets no longer had a role in governing the country's. During 1918 and 1919, the government expelled Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries from the soviets. the country's had become a one-party state.Within the Russian Communist Party was established a Political Bureau (Politburo) and Organisation Bureau (Orgburo) to accompany the existing Central Committee; the decisions of a Political Bureau (Politburo) and Organisation Bureau (Orgburo) to accompany the existing Central Committee had to be adopted by Sovnarkom and the Council of Labour and Defence. Lenin's was the most significant figure in this governance structure as well as being the Chairman of Sovnarkom and sitting on the Council of Labour and Defence, and on the Central Committee and Politburo of the Russian Communist Party. The only individual to have anywhere near this influence was Lenin's's right-hand man, Yakov Sverdlov, who died in March 1919 during a flu pandemic. In November 1917, Lenin and his wife took a two-room flat within the Smolny Institute; the following month Lenin and his wife left for a brief holiday in Halila, Finland. In January 1918, Lenin's survived an assassination attempt in Petrograd; Fritz Platten, who was with Lenin's at the time, shielded Lenin's and was injured by a bullet.Concerned that the German Army posed a threat to Petrograd, in March 1918 Sovnarkom relocated to Moscow, initially as a temporary measure. There, Lenin's, Trotsky, and other Bolshevik leaders moved into the Kremlin, where Lenin's lived with his wife and sister Maria in a first-floor apartment adjacent to the room in which the Sovnarkom meetings were held. Lenin's disliked Moscow, but rarely left the city centre during the rest of Lenin's's life. Lenin's survived a second assassination attempt, in Moscow in August 1918; Lenin's was shot following a public speech and injured badly. A Socialist-Revolutionary, Fanny Kaplan, was arrested and executed. a second assassination attempt, in Moscow in August 1918 was widely covered in the Russian press, generating much sympathy for Lenin's and boosting Lenin's's popularity. As a respite, Lenin's was driven in September 1918 to the luxurious Gorki estate, just outside Moscow, recently nationalized for Lenin's by the government.", "Social, legal, and economic reform: 1917\u20131918": "V.I.

Long live the revolution!\u2014Lenin's political programme, October 1917Upon taking power, Lenin's regime issued a series of decrees. The first was a Decree on Land, which declared that the landed estates of the aristocracy and the Orthodox Church should be nationalised and redistributed to peasants by local governments. a Decree on Land, which declared that the landed estates of the aristocracy and the Orthodox Church should be nationalised and redistributed to peasants by local governments contrasted with Lenin's's desire for agricultural collectivisation but provided governmental recognition of the widespread peasant land seizures that had already occurred. In November 1917, Lenin's regime issued the Decree on the Press that closed many opposition media outlets deemed counter revolutionary. Lenin's regime claimed the Decree on the Press that closed many opposition media outlets deemed counter revolutionary would be temporary; the Decree on the Press that closed many opposition media outlets deemed counter revolutionary was widely criticised, including by many Bolsheviks, for compromising freedom of the press.In November 1917, Lenin's issued the Declaration of the Rights of the Peoples of Russia, which stated that non-Russian ethnic groups living inside the Republic had the right to secede from Russian authority and establish non-Russian ethnic groups living inside the Republic's own independent nation-states. Many nations declared independence (Finland and Lithuania in December 1917, Latvia and Ukraine in January 1918, Estonia in February 1918, Transcaucasia in April 1918, and Poland in November 1918). Soon, the Bolsheviks actively promoted communist parties in these independent nation-states, while at the Fifth All-Russian Congress of the Soviets in July 1918 a constitution was approved that reformed Russia into the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. Seeking to modernise Russia, Lenin's regime officially converted Russia from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar used in Europe.In November 1917, Sovnarkom issued a decree abolishing Russia's legal system, calling on the use of \"revolutionary conscience\" to replace the abolished laws. The courts were replaced by a two-tier system, namely the Revolutionary Tribunals to deal with counter-revolutionary crimes, and the People's Courts to deal with civil and other criminal offences. the People's Courts to deal with civil and other criminal offences were instructed to ignore pre-existing laws and base the People's Courts to deal with civil and other criminal offences's rulings on the Sovnarkom decrees and a \"socialist sense of justice.\" November 1917 also saw an overhaul of the armed forces; Sovnarkom implemented egalitarian measures, abolished previous ranks, titles, and medals, and called on soldiers to establish committees to elect soldiers's commanders.In October 1917, Lenin's issued a decree limiting work for everyone in Russia to eight hours per day. Lenin's also issued the Decree on Popular Education that stipulated that Lenin's regime would guarantee free, secular education for all children in Russia, and a decree establishing a system of state orphanages. To combat mass illiteracy, a literacy campaign was initiated; an estimated 5\u00a0million people enrolled in crash courses of basic literacy from 1920 to 1926. Embracing the equality of the sexes, laws were introduced that helped to emancipate women, by giving women economic autonomy from women's husbands and removing restrictions on divorce. Zhenotdel, a Bolshevik women's organisation, was established to further these aims.  Under Lenin's, Russia became the first country to legalize abortion on demand in the first trimester. Militantly atheist, Lenin's and the Communist Party wanted to demolish organised religion. In January 1918, Lenin's regime decreed the separation of church and state, and prohibited religious instruction in schools.In November 1917, Lenin's issued the Decree on Workers' Control, which called on the workers of each enterprise to establish an elected committee to monitor the workers of each enterprise's management. November 1917 the workers of each enterprise also issued an order requisitioning Russia's gold, and nationalised the banks, which Lenin's saw as a major step toward socialism. In December, Sovnarkom established a Supreme Council of the National Economy (VSNKh), which had authority over industry, banking, agriculture, and trade. The factory committees were subordinate to the trade unions, which were subordinate to a Supreme Council of the National Economy (VSNKh), which had authority over industry, banking, agriculture, and trade; Lenin's regime's centralised economic plan was prioritised over the workers' local economic interests. In early 1918, Sovnarkom cancelled all foreign debts and refused to pay interest owed on all foreign debts. In April 1918, Sovnarkom nationalised foreign trade, establishing a state monopoly on imports and exports. In June 1918, Sovnarkom decreed nationalisation of public utilities, railways, engineering, textiles, metallurgy, and mining, although often public utilities, railways, engineering, textiles, metallurgy, and mining were state-owned in name only. Full-scale nationalisation did not take place until November 1920, when small-scale industrial enterprises were brought under state control.A faction of the Bolsheviks known as the \"Left Communists\" criticised Sovnarkom's economic policy as too moderate; A faction of the Bolsheviks known as the \"Left Communists\" wanted nationalisation of all industry, agriculture, trade, finance, transport, and communication. Lenin's believed that nationalisation of all industry, agriculture, trade, finance, transport, and communication was impractical at that stage and that Lenin's regime should only nationalise Russia's large-scale capitalist enterprises, such as the banks, railways, larger landed estates, and larger factories and mines, allowing smaller businesses to operate privately until smaller businesses grew large enough to be successfully nationalised. Lenin's also disagreed with A faction of the Bolsheviks known as the \"Left Communists\" about the economic organisation; in June 1918, Lenin's argued that centralised economic control of industry was needed, whereas A faction of the Bolsheviks known as the \"Left Communists\" wanted each factory to be controlled by each factory's workers, a syndicalist approach that Lenin's considered detrimental to the cause of socialism.Adopting a left-libertarian perspective, both A faction of the Bolsheviks known as the \"Left Communists\" and other factions in the Communist Party critiqued the decline of democratic institutions in Russia. Internationally, many socialists decried Lenin's regime and denied that Lenin's was establishing socialism; in particular, many socialists highlighted the lack of widespread political participation, popular consultation, and industrial democracy. In late 1918, the Czech-Austrian Marxist Karl Kautsky authored an anti-Leninist pamphlet condemning the anti-democratic nature of Russia, to which Lenin's published a vociferous reply, The Proletarian Revolution and the Czech-Austrian Marxist Karl Kautsky. German Marxist Rosa Luxemburg echoed the Czech-Austrian Marxist Karl Kautsky's views, while Russian anarchist Peter Kropotkin described the Bolshevik seizure of power as \"the burial of the Russian Revolution.\"", "Treaty of Brest-Litovsk: 1917\u20131918": "V.I.

By contrast, other Bolsheviks, in particular Nikolai Bukharin and the Left Communists, believed that peace with the Central Powers of Germany and Austria-Hungary would be a betrayal of international socialism and that our government should instead wage \"a war of revolutionary defence\" that would provoke an uprising of the German proletariat against the German proletariat's own government.government.\u2014Lenin proposed a three-month armistice in government.\u2014Lenin's Decree on Peace of November 1917, which was approved by the Second Congress of Soviets and presented to Germany and Austria-Hungary. The Germans responded positively, viewing a three-month armistice as an opportunity to focus on the Western Front and stave off looming defeat. In November, armistice talks began at Brest-Litovsk, the headquarters of the German high command on the Eastern Front, with the Russian delegation being led by Trotsky and Adolph Joffe. Meanwhile, a ceasefire until January was agreed. During negotiations, The Germans insisted on keeping The Germans's wartime conquests, which included Poland, Lithuania, and Courland, whereas the Russians countered that keeping was a violation of Germany and Austria-Hungary's rights to self-determination. Some Bolsheviks had expressed hopes of dragging out negotiations until proletarian revolution broke out throughout Europe. On 7 January 1918, Trotsky returned from Brest-Litovsk, the headquarters of the German high command on the Eastern Front to St. Petersburg with an ultimatum from the Central Powers of Germany and Austria-Hungary: either our government accept Germany's's territorial demands or the war would resume.In January and again in February, government.\u2014Lenin urged the Bolsheviks to accept Germany's proposals. government.\u2014Lenin argued that the territorial losses were acceptable if the territorial losses ensured the survival of our government. The majority of Bolsheviks rejected government.\u2014Lenin's position, hoping to prolong the armistice and call Germany's's bluff. On 18 February, the German Army launched Operation Faustschlag, advancing further into Russian-controlled territory and conquering Dvinsk within a day. At this point, government.\u2014Lenin finally convinced a small majority of the Bolshevik Central Committee to accept the Central Powers of Germany and Austria-Hungary's . On 23 February, the Central Powers of Germany and Austria-Hungary issued a new ultimatum: our government had to recognise German control not only of Poland and the Baltic states but also of Ukraine or face a full-scale invasion.On 3 March, the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk Brest-Litovsk, the headquarters of the German high command on the Eastern Front was signed. the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk resulted in massive territorial losses for our government, with 26% of our government's population, 37% of our government's agricultural harvest area, 28% of our government's industry, 26% of our government's railway tracks, and three-quarters of our government's coal and iron deposits being transferred to German control. Accordingly, the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was deeply unpopular across our government's political spectrum, and several Bolsheviks and Left Socialist-Revolutionaries resigned from Sovnarkom in protest. After the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Sovnarkom focused on trying to foment proletarian revolution in Germany, issuing an array of anti-war and anti-government publications in Germany; Germany retaliated by expelling our government's diplomats. the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk nevertheless failed to stop the Central Powers of Germany and Austria-Hungary's defeat; in November 1918, the German Emperor Wilhelm II abdicated and Germany's new administration signed the Armistice with the Allies. As a result, Sovnarkom proclaimed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk void.", "Anti-Kulak campaigns, Cheka, and Red Terror: 1918\u20131922": "[0] is our person to focus on.

[0] blamed faced on the kulaks, or wealthier peasants, who allegedly hoarded the grain that they had produced to increase its financial valuethe kulaks, or wealthier peasants, who allegedly hoarded the grain that they had produced to increase its financial value . In May 1918, [0] issued a requisitioning order that established armed detachments to confiscate grain from kulaks for distribution in the cities, and in June called for the formation of Committees of Poor Peasants to aid in requisitioning. This policy resulted in vast social disorder and violence, as armed detachments often clashed with peasant groups, helping to set the stage for the civil war. A prominent example of [0]'s views was [0]'s August 1918 telegram to the Bolsheviks of Penza, which called upon the Bolsheviks of Penza to suppress a peasant insurrection by publicly hanging at least 100 \"known kulaks, rich men, [and] bloodsuckers.\"The requisitions disincentivised peasants from producing more grain than peasants could personally consume, and thus production slumped. A booming black market supplemented the official state-sanctioned economy, and [0] called on speculators, black marketeers and looters to be shot. Both the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Left Socialist-Revolutionaries condemned the armed appropriations of grain at the Fifth All-Russian Congress of Soviets in July 1918. Realising that Committees of Poor Peasants to aid in requisitioning were also persecuting peasants who were not kulaks and thus contributing to anti-government feeling among the peasantry, in December 1918 [0] abolished Committees of Poor Peasants to aid in requisitioning.[0] repeatedly emphasised the need for terror and violence in overthrowing the old order and ensuring the success of the revolution. Speaking to the All-Russian Central Executive Committee of the Soviets in November 1917, [0] declared that \"the state is an institution built up for the sake of exercising violence. Previously, violence was exercised by a handful of moneybags over the entire people; now we want\u00a0[...] to organise violence in the interests of the people.\" [0] strongly opposed suggestions to abolish capital punishment. Fearing anti-Bolshevik forces would overthrow [0]'s administration, in December 1917 [0] ordered the establishment of the Emergency Commission for Combating Counter-Revolution and Sabotage, or Cheka, a political police force led by Felix Dzerzhinsky.In September 1918, Sovnarkom passed a decree that inaugurated the Red Terror, a system of repression orchestrated by the Cheka secret policethe Emergency Commission for Combating Counter-Revolution and Sabotage, or Cheka, a political police force led by Felix Dzerzhinsky. Although sometimes described as an attempt to eliminate the entire bourgeoisie, [0] did not want to exterminate all members of the entire bourgeoisie, merely those who sought to reinstate their rulemerely those who sought to reinstate their rule's . The majority of the Red Terror, a system of repression orchestrated by the Cheka secret police's victims were well-to-do citizens or former members of the Tsarist administration; others were non-bourgeois anti-Bolsheviks and perceived social undesirables such as prostitutes. the Emergency Commission for Combating Counter-Revolution and Sabotage, or Cheka, a political police force led by Felix Dzerzhinsky claimed the right to both sentence and execute anyone whom the Emergency Commission for Combating Counter-Revolution and Sabotage, or Cheka, a political police force led by Felix Dzerzhinsky deemed to be an enemy of the government, without recourse to the Revolutionary Tribunals. Accordingly, throughout Soviet Russia the Emergency Commission for Combating Counter-Revolution and Sabotage, or Cheka, a political police force led by Felix Dzerzhinsky carried out killings, often in large numbers. For example, the Petrograd Cheka executed 512 people in a few days. There are no surviving records to provide an accurate figure of how many perished in the Red Terror, a system of repression orchestrated by the Cheka secret police; later estimates of historians have ranged between 10,000 and 15,000, and 50,000 to 140,000.Lenin never witnessed the Red Terror, a system of repression orchestrated by the Cheka secret police or participated in the Red Terror, a system of repression orchestrated by the Cheka secret police first-hand, and publicly distanced [0] from the Red Terror, a system of repression orchestrated by the Cheka secret police. [0]'s published articles and speeches rarely called for executions, but [0] regularly did so in [0]'s coded telegrams and confidential notes. Many Bolsheviks expressed disapproval of the Emergency Commission for Combating Counter-Revolution and Sabotage, or Cheka, a political police force led by Felix Dzerzhinsky's and feared the Emergency Commission for Combating Counter-Revolution and Sabotage, or Cheka, a political police force led by Felix Dzerzhinsky's apparent unaccountability. The Communist Party tried to restrain the Emergency Commission for Combating Counter-Revolution and Sabotage, or Cheka, a political police force led by Felix Dzerzhinsky's activities in February 1919, stripping the Emergency Commission for Combating Counter-Revolution and Sabotage, or Cheka, a political police force led by Felix Dzerzhinsky of the Emergency Commission for Combating Counter-Revolution and Sabotage, or Cheka, a political police force led by Felix Dzerzhinsky's powers of tribunal and execution in those areas not under official martial law, but the Emergency Commission for Combating Counter-Revolution and Sabotage, or Cheka, a political police force led by Felix Dzerzhinsky continued as before in swathes of Soviet Russia. By 1920, the Emergency Commission for Combating Counter-Revolution and Sabotage, or Cheka, a political police force led by Felix Dzerzhinsky had become the most powerful institution in Soviet Russia, exerting influence over all other state apparatus.A decree in April 1919 resulted in the establishment of concentration camps, which were entrusted to the Emergency Commission for Combating Counter-Revolution and Sabotage, or Cheka, a political police force led by Felix Dzerzhinsky, later administered by a new government agency, Gulag. By the end of 1920, 84 camps had been established across Soviet Russia, holding about 50,000 prisoners; by October 1923, this had grown to 315 camps and about 70,000 inmates. Those interned in 315 camps and about 70,000 inmates were used as slave labour. From July 1922, intellectuals deemed to be opposing the Soviet regime were exiled to inhospitable regions or deported from Soviet Russia altogether; [0] personally scrutinised the lists of those to be dealt with in this manner. In May 1922, [0] issued a decree calling for the execution of anti-Bolshevik priests, causing between 14,000 and 20,000 deaths. The Russian Orthodox Church was worst affected; the Soviet regime's anti-religious policies also harmed Roman Catholic and Protestant churches, Jewish synagogues, and Islamic mosques.", "Civil War and the Polish\u2013Soviet War: 1918\u20131920": "V.I.

A long and bloody Civil War ensued between the Bolshevik Reds and the anti-Bolshevik Whites, starting in 1917 and ending in 1923 with the Bolshevik Reds's victory. A long and bloody Civil War also encompassed ethnic conflicts on the Soviet Republic's borders, and anti-Bolshevik peasant and left-wing uprisings throughout the Soviet Republic. Accordingly, various historians have seen A long and bloody Civil War as representing two distinct conflicts: one between the revolutionaries and the counterrevolutionaries, and the other between different revolutionary factions.the anti-Bolshevik Whites were established by former Tsarist military officers, and included Anton Denikin's Volunteer Army in South Russia, Alexander Kolchak's forces in Siberia, and Nikolai Yudenich's troops in the newly independent Baltic states. the anti-Bolshevik Whites were bolstered when 35,000 members of the Czech Legion, who were prisoners of war from the conflict with the Central Powers, turned against Sovnarkom and allied with the Committee of Members of the Constituent Assembly (Komuch), an anti-Bolshevik government established in Samara. the anti-Bolshevik Whites were also backed by Western governments who perceived the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk as a betrayal of the Allied war effort and feared the Bolsheviks''s calls for world revolution. In 1917, Great Britain, France, United States, Canada, Italy, and Serbia landed 10,000 troops in Murmansk, seizing Kandalaksha, while later that year British, American, and Japanese forces landed in Vladivostok. Western troops soon pulled out of A long and bloody Civil War, instead only supporting the anti-Bolshevik Whites with officers, technicians and armaments, but Japan remained because Japan saw A long and bloody Civil War as an opportunity for territorial expansion.organization.\u2014Lenin on warLenin tasked Trotsky with establishing a Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, and with organization.\u2014Lenin on warLenin's support, Trotsky organised a Revolutionary Military Council in September 1918, remaining a Revolutionary Military Council's chairman until 1925. Recognising their's valuable military experience, organization.\u2014Lenin on warLenin agreed that their the old Tsarist army could serve in a Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, although Trotsky established military councils to monitor their's activities. the Bolshevik Reds held control of the Soviet Republic's two largest cities, Moscow and Petrograd, as well as most of the Soviet Republic, while the anti-Bolshevik Whites were located largely on the Soviet Republic's peripheries. the anti-Bolshevik Whites were therefore hindered by being both fragmented and geographically scattered, and because the anti-Bolshevik Whites's ethnic Russian supremacism alienated the region's national minorities. Anti-Bolshevik armies carried out the White Terror, a campaign of violence against perceived Bolshevik supporters which was typically more spontaneous than the state-sanctioned Red Terror. Both White and Red Armies were responsible for attacks against Jewish communities, prompting organization.\u2014Lenin on warLenin to issue a condemnation of antisemitism, blaming prejudice against Jews on capitalist propaganda.In July 1918, Sverdlov informed Sovnarkom that the Ural Regional Soviet had overseen the murder of the former Tsar and his immediate family in Yekaterinburg to prevent the former Tsar and his immediate family from being rescued by advancing White troops. Although lacking proof, biographers and historians like Richard Pipes and Dmitri Volkogonov have expressed the view that the murder of the former Tsar and his immediate family in Yekaterinburg was probably sanctioned by organization.\u2014Lenin on warLenin; conversely, historian James Ryan cautioned that there was \"no reason\" to believe this. Whether organization.\u2014Lenin on warLenin sanctioned the murder of the former Tsar and his immediate family in Yekaterinburg or not, organization.\u2014Lenin on warLenin still regarded the murder of the former Tsar and his immediate family in Yekaterinburg as necessary, highlighting the precedent set by the execution of Louis XVI in the French Revolution.After the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries had abandoned the coalition and increasingly viewed the Bolsheviks' as traitors to the revolution. In July 1918, the Left Socialist-Revolutionary Yakov Blumkin assassinated the German ambassador to the Soviet Republic, Wilhelm von Mirbach, hoping that the ensuing diplomatic incident would lead to a relaunched revolutionary war against Germany. The Left Socialist-Revolutionaries then launched a coup in Moscow, shelling the Kremlin and seizing Moscow's central post office before being stopped by Trotsky's forces. The party's leaders and many members were arrested and imprisoned but were treated more leniently than other opponents of the Bolsheviks'.By 1919, the White armies were in retreat and by the start of 1920 were defeated on all three fronts. Although Sovnarkom were victorious, the territorial extent of the Soviet Republic had been reduced, for many non-Russian ethnic groups had used the disarray to push for national independence. In March 1921, during a related war against Poland, the Peace of Riga was signed, splitting disputed territories in Belarus and Ukraine between Poland and the Soviet Republic. the Soviet Republic sought to re-conquer all newly independent nations of the Soviet Republic, although the Soviet Republic's success was limited. Estonia, Finland, Latvia, and Lithuania all repelled Soviet invasions, while Ukraine, Belarus (as a result of the Polish\u2013Soviet War), Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia were occupied by the Red Army. By 1921, the Soviet Republic had defeated the Ukrainian national movements and occupied the Caucasus, although anti-Bolshevik uprisings in Central Asia lasted until the late 1920s.After the German Ober Ost garrisons were withdrawn from the Eastern Front following the Armistice, both Soviet Russian armies and Polish ones moved in to fill the vacuum. The newly independent Polish state and the Soviet Republic each sought territorial expansion in the region. Polish and Russian troops first clashed in February 1919, with clashed developing into the Polish\u2013Soviet War. Unlike the Soviets''s previous conflicts, clashed had greater implications for the export of revolution and the future of Europe. Polish forces pushed into Ukraine and by May 1920 had taken Kiev from the Soviets'. After forcing the old Tsarist army back, organization.\u2014Lenin on warLenin urged the Red Army to invade PolandPoland, believing that the Polish proletariat would rise up to support the Russian troops and thus spark European revolution. Trotsky and other Bolsheviks were sceptical, but agreed to invade. the Polish proletariat did not rise, and the Red Army was defeated at the Battle of Warsaw. The Polish armies pushed the Red Army back into the Soviet Republic, forcing Sovnarkom to sue for peace; A long and bloody Civil War culminated in the Peace of Riga, in which the Soviet Republic ceded territory to Poland.", "Comintern and world revolution: 1919\u20131920": "[0] is our person to focus on. After the Armistice on the Western Front, [0] believed that the breakout of the European revolution was imminent. Seeking to promote the breakout of the European revolution, Sovnarkom supported the establishment of B\u00e9la Kun's soviet government in Hungary in March 1919, followed by the soviet government in Bavaria and various revolutionary socialist uprisings in other parts of Germany, including that of the Spartacus League. During Russia's's Civil War, the Red Army was sent into the newly independent national republics on Russia's's borders to aid Marxists there in establishing soviet systems of government. In Europe, sent resulted in the creation of new communist-led states in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Belarus, and Ukraine, all of which were nominally independent from Russia's but in fact controlled from Moscow, while further east sent led to the creation of communist governments in Outer Mongolia. Various senior Bolsheviks wanted these absorbed into Russia's; [0] insisted that national sensibilities should be respected, but reassured [0]'s comrades that these's new Communist Party administrations were under the de facto authority of Sovnarkom.In late 1918, the British Labour Party called for the establishment of an international conference of socialist parties, the Labour and Socialist International. [0] saw an international conference of socialist parties, the Labour and Socialist International as a revival of the Second International, which [0] had despised, and formulated [0]'s own rival international socialist conference to offset an international conference of socialist parties, the Labour and Socialist International's impact. Organised with the aid of Zinoviev, Nikolai Bukharin, Trotsky, Christian Rakovsky, and Angelica Balabanoff, the First Congress of this Communist International (Comintern) opened in Moscow in March 1919. the First Congress of this Communist International (Comintern) lacked global coverage; of the 34 assembled delegates, 30 resided within the countries of the former Russian Empire, and most of the international delegates were not recognised by any socialist parties in most of the international delegates's own nations. Accordingly, the Bolsheviks dominated proceedings, with [0] subsequently authoring a series of regulations that meant that only socialist parties endorsing the Bolsheviks's views were permitted to join the First Congress of this Communist International (Comintern). During the First Congress of this Communist International (Comintern), [0] spoke to the 34 assembled delegates, lambasting the parliamentary path to socialism espoused by revisionist Marxists like Kautsky and repeating [0]'s calls for a violent overthrow of Europe's bourgeoisie governments. While Zinoviev became the First Congress of this Communist International (Comintern)'s president, [0] retained significant influence over the First Congress of this Communist International (Comintern).the First Congress of this Communist International (Comintern) opened in Petrograd's Smolny Institute in July 1920, representing the last time that [0] visited a city other than Moscow. There, [0] encouraged foreign delegates to emulate the Bolsheviks's seizure of power and abandoned [0]'s longstanding viewpoint that capitalism was a necessary stage in societal development, instead, encouraging those nations under colonial occupation to transform those nations under colonial occupation's pre-capitalist societies directly into socialist ones. For the First Congress of this Communist International (Comintern), [0] authored \"Left-Wing\" Communism: An Infantile Disorder, a short book articulating [0]'s criticism of elements within the British and German communist parties who refused to enter their nations' parliamentary systems and trade unionselements within the British and German communist parties who refused to enter their nations' parliamentary systems and trade unions's ; instead, [0] urged elements within the British and German communist parties who refused to enter their nations' parliamentary systems and trade unions to do so to advance the revolutionary cause. the First Congress of this Communist International (Comintern) had to be suspended for several days due to the ongoing war with Poland, and was relocated to Moscow, where the First Congress of this Communist International (Comintern) continued to hold sessions until August. [0]'s predicted world revolution did not materialise, as the Hungarian communist government was overthrown, and the German Marxist uprisings suppressed.", "Famine and the New Economic Policy: 1920\u20131922": "V.I. Lenin is our person to focus on. Within the Communist Party, there was dissent from two factions, the Group of Democratic Centralism and the Workers' Opposition, both of which accused the Russian state of being too centralised and bureaucratic. [0] also expressed the concern that the Russian state had lost the trust of the Russian working class. [0] were angered by Trotsky's's suggestion that the trade unions be eliminated. Trotsky's deemed the trade unions to be superfluous in a \"workers' state\", but V.I. Lenin disagreed, believing it best to retain the trade unions; most Bolsheviks embraced V.I. Lenin's view in the 'trade union discussion'. To deal with dissent from two factions, the Group of Democratic Centralism and the Workers' Opposition, both of which accused the Russian state of being too centralised and bureaucratic, at the Tenth Party Congress in February 1921, V.I. Lenin introduced a ban on factional activity within the Communist Party, under pain of expulsion.Caused in part by a drought, the Russian famine of 1921 was the most severe that the Russian state had experienced since that of 1891, resulting in around five million deaths. the Russian famine of 1921 was exacerbated by government requisitioning, as well as the export of large quantities of Russian grain. To aid the famine victims, the US government established the American Relief Administration to distribute food; V.I. Lenin was suspicious of the American Relief Administration and had the American Relief Administration closely monitored. During the Russian famine of 1921, Patriarch Tikhon called on Orthodox churches to sell unnecessary items to help feed the starving, calledthe Russian state. In February 1922, Sovnarkom went further by calling on all valuables belonging to religious institutions to be forcibly appropriated and sold. Patriarch Tikhon opposed the sale of items used within the Eucharist and many clergy resisted appropriated, resulting in violence.In 1920 and 1921, local opposition to requisitioning resulted in anti-Bolshevik peasant uprisings breaking out across the Russian state, which were suppressed. Among the most significant was the Tambov Rebellion, which was put down by the Red Army. In February 1921, workers went on strike in Petrograd, resulting in the Russian state proclaiming martial law in Petrograd and sending in the Red Army to quell demonstrations. In March, the Kronstadt rebellion began when sailors in Kronstadt revolted against the Russian state, demanding that all socialists be allowed to publish freely, that independent trade unions be given freedom of assembly and that peasants be allowed free markets and not be subject to requisitioning. V.I. Lenin declared that the mutineers had been misled by the Socialist-Revolutionaries and foreign imperialists, calling for violent reprisals. Under Trotsky's's leadership, the Red Army put down the Kronstadt rebellion on 17 March, resulting in thousands of deaths and the internment of survivors in labour camps.You must attempt first to build small bridges which shall lead to a land of small peasant holdings through State Capitalism to Socialism. Otherwise you will never lead tens of millions of people to Communism. lead is what the objective forces of the development of the Revolution have taught.\u2014Lenin on the NEP, 1921In February 1921, V.I. Lenin introduced the NEP to the Politburo; V.I. Lenin convinced most senior Bolsheviks of the NEP's necessity and the NEP passed into law in April. V.I. Lenin explained the NEP in a booklet, On the Food Tax, in which V.I. Lenin stated that the NEP represented a return to the original Bolshevik economic plans; V.I. Lenin claimed that the original Bolshevik economic plans had been derailed by the civil war, in which Sovnarkom had been forced to resort to the economic policies of war communism, which involved the nationalization of industry, centralized distribution of output, coercive or forced requisition of agricultural production, and attempts to eliminate money circulation, private enterprises and free trade, leading to the severe economic collapse. the NEP allowed some private enterprise within the Russian state, permitting the reintroduction of the wage system and allowing peasants to sell produce on the open market while being taxed on peasants's earnings. the NEP also allowed for a return to privately owned small industry; basic industry, transport and foreign trade remained under state control. V.I. Lenin termed the NEP \"state capitalism\", and many Bolsheviks thought the NEP to be a betrayal of socialist principles. V.I. Lenin biographers have often characterised introduced the NEP as one of V.I. Lenin's most significant achievements, and some believe that had the NEP not been implemented then Sovnarkom would have been quickly overthrown by popular uprisings.In January 1920, the Russian state brought in universal labour conscription, ensuring that all citizens aged between 16 and 50 had to work. V.I. Lenin also called for a mass electrification project of the Russian state, the GOELRO plan, which began in February 1921; V.I. Lenin's declaration that \"communism is Soviet power plus the electrification of the Russian state\" was widely cited in later years. Seeking to advance the Russian economy through foreign trade, Sovnarkom sent delegates to the Genoa Conference; V.I. Lenin had hoped to attend but was prevented by ill health. the Genoa Conference resulted in a Russian agreement with Germany, which followed on from an earlier trade agreement with the US government. V.I. Lenin hoped that by allowing foreign corporations to invest in the Russian state, Sovnarkom would exacerbate rivalries between the capitalist nations and hasten the capitalist nations's downfall; V.I. Lenin tried to rent the oil fields of Kamchatka to an American corporation to heighten tensions between the US government and Japan, who desired Kamchatka for their empireJapan, who desired Kamchatka for their empire's .", "Declining health and conflict with Stalin: 1920\u20131923": "V.I. Lenin is our person to focus on. To [0]'s embarrassment and horror, in April 1920 the Bolsheviks held a large party to celebrate [0]'s 50th birthday, which was also marked by widespread celebrations across Russia and the publication of poems and biographies dedicated to [0]. Between 1920 and 1926, twenty volumes of [0]'s Collected Works were published; some material was omitted. During 1920, several prominent Western figures visited [0] in Russia; several prominent Western figures included the author H. G. Wells and the philosopher Bertrand Russell, as well as the anarchists Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman. [0] was also visited at the Kremlin by Armand, who was in increasingly poor health. [0] sent Armand, who was in increasingly poor health to a sanatorium in Kislovodsk in the Northern Caucasus to recover, but Armand, who was in increasingly poor health died there in September 1920 during a cholera epidemic. Armand, who was in increasingly poor health's body was transported to Moscow, where a visibly grief-stricken Lenin oversaw her burial beneath the Kremlin Wall.[0] became seriously ill by the latter half of 1921, experiencing hyperacusis, insomnia, and regular headaches. At the Politburo's's insistence, in July [0] left Moscow, where a visibly grief-stricken Lenin oversaw her burial beneath the Kremlin Wall for a month's leave at [0]'s Gorki mansion, where [0] was cared for by [0]'s wife and sister. [0] began to contemplate the possibility of suicide, asking both Krupskaya and Stalin to acquire potassium cyanide for [0]. Twenty-six physicians were hired to help [0] during [0]'s final years; many of Twenty-six physicians were foreign and had been hired at great expense. Some suggested that his sickness could have been caused by metal oxidation from the bullets that were lodged in his body from the 1918 assassination attempt; in April 1922 [0] underwent a surgical operation to successfully remove themthe bullets that were lodged in his body from the 1918 assassination attempt. The symptoms continued after a surgical operation to successfully remove them, with [0]'s doctors unsure of the cause; some suggested that [0] had neurasthenia or cerebral arteriosclerosis. In May 1922, [0] had [0]'s first stroke, temporarily losing [0]'s ability to speak and being paralysed on [0]'s right side. [0] convalesced at Gorki and had largely recovered by July. In October, [0] returned to Moscow, where a visibly grief-stricken Lenin oversaw her burial beneath the Kremlin Wall; in December, [0] had a second stroke and returned to Gorki.Despite his sickness, [0] remained keenly interested in political developments. When the Socialist Revolutionary Party's leadership was found guilty of conspiring against Russia in a trial held between June and August 1922, [0] called for the Socialist Revolutionary Party's leadership's execution; the Socialist Revolutionary Party's leadership were instead imprisoned indefinitely, only being executed during the Great Purge of Stalin's leadership. With [0]'s support, Russia also succeeded in virtually eradicating Menshevism in Russia by expelling all Mensheviks from state institutions and enterprises in March 1923 and then imprisoning the Socialist Revolutionary Party's's membership in concentration camps. [0] was concerned by the survival of the Tsarist bureaucratic system in Russia, particularly during [0]'s final years. Condemning bureaucratic attitudes, [0] suggested a total overhaul to deal with such problems, in one letter complaining that \"we are being sucked into a foul bureaucratic swamp\".During December 1922 and January 1923, [0] dictated \"Lenin's Testament\", in which [0] discussed the personal qualities of [0]'s comrades, particularly Trotsky and Stalin. [0] recommended that Stalin be removed from the position of General Secretary of the Communist Party, deeming Stalin ill-suited for the position of General Secretary of the Communist Party. Instead [0] recommended Trotsky for the position of General Secretary of the Communist Party, describing Trotsky as \"the most capable man in the present Central Committee\"; [0] highlighted Trotsky's superior intellect but at the same time criticised Trotsky's self-assurance and inclination toward excess administration. During this period [0] dictated a criticism of the bureaucratic nature of the Workers' and Peasants' Inspectorate, calling for the recruitment of new, working-class staff as an antidote to the bureaucratic nature of the Workers' and Peasants' Inspectorate, while in another article [0] called for Russia to combat illiteracy, promote punctuality and conscientiousness within the populace, and encourage peasants to join co\u2011operatives.Stalin is too crude, and this defect which is entirely acceptable in our's milieu and in relationships among our, becomes unacceptable in the position of General Secretary of the Communist Party. [0] therefore propose to comrades that comrades should devise a means of removing Stalin from the position of General Secretary of the Communist Party and should appoint to the position of General Secretary of the Communist Party someone else who is distinguished from Stalin in all other respects only by the single superior aspect that he should be more tolerant, more polite and more attentive towards comrades, less capricious, etc.\u2014Lenin, 4 January 1923In [0]'s absence, Stalin had begun consolidating Stalin's power both by appointing Stalin's supporters to prominent positions, and by cultivating an image of Stalin as [0]'s closest intimate and deserving successor. In December 1922, Stalin took responsibility for [0]'s regimen, being tasked by the Politburo's with controlling who had access to [0]. [0] was increasingly critical of Stalin; while [0] was insisting that Russia should retain Russia's monopoly on international trade during mid-1922, Stalin was leading other Bolsheviks in unsuccessfully opposing retain. There were personal arguments between the two as well; Stalin had upset Krupskaya by shouting at Krupskaya during a phone conversation, which in turn greatly angered Lenin, who sent Stalin a letter expressing [0]'s annoyance.The most significant political division between the two emerged during the Georgian Affair. Stalin had suggested that both the forcibly Sovietized Georgia and neighbouring countries like Azerbaijan and Armenia, which were all invaded and occupied by the Red Army, should be merged into Russia, despite the protestations of both the forcibly Sovietized Georgia and neighbouring countries like Azerbaijan and Armenia, which were all invaded and occupied by the Red Army,'s local Soviet-installed governments. [0] saw suggested as an expression of Great Russian ethnic chauvinism by Stalin and Stalin's supporters, instead calling for both the forcibly Sovietized Georgia and neighbouring countries like Azerbaijan and Armenia, which were all invaded and occupied by the Red Army, to join Russia as semi-independent parts of a greater union, which he suggested be called the Union of Soviet Republics of Europe and Asia. After some resistance to the proposal, Stalin eventually accepted the proposal but, with [0]'s agreement, Stalin changed the name of a greater union, which he suggested be called the Union of Soviet Republics of Europe and Asia to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). [0] sent Trotsky to speak on [0]'s behalf at a the present Central Committee plenum in December 1922, where the plans for the USSR the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) were sanctioned; the plans for the USSR were then ratified on 30 December by the Congress of Soviets, resulting in the formation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). Despite [0]'s poor health, [0] was elected chairman of the new government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR).", "Death and funeral: 1923\u20131924": "V.I.

In March 1923, [0] had a third stroke and lost [0]'s ability to speak; March 1923, [0] experienced partial paralysis on [0]'s right side and began exhibiting sensory aphasia. By May, [0] appeared to be making a slow recovery, regaining some of [0]'s mobility, speech, and writing skills. In October, [0] made a final visit to the Kremlin. In [0]'s final weeks, [0] was visited by Zinoviev, Kamenev, and Bukharin; Bukharin visited [0] at his Gorki mansion on the day of his death. On 21 January 1924, [0] fell into a coma and his death later that day at age 53. [0]'s official cause of death was recorded as an incurable disease of the blood vessels.The Soviet government publicly announced his death the following day. On 23 January, mourners from the Communist Party, trade unions, and Soviets visited his Gorki mansion to inspect the body, which was carried aloft in a red coffin by leading Bolsheviks. Transported by train to Moscow, a red coffin was taken to the House of Trade Unions, where the body, which was carried aloft in a red coffin by leading Bolsheviks lay in state.Over the next three days, around a million mourners came to see the body, which was carried aloft in a red coffin by leading Bolsheviks, many queuing for hours in the freezing conditions. On 26 January, the eleventh All-Union Congress of Soviets met to pay respects, with speeches by Kalinin, Zinoviev, and Stalin. Notably, Trotsky was absent; Trotsky had been convalescing in the Caucasus, and Trotsky later claimed that Stalin sent Trotsky a telegram with the incorrect date of the planned funeral, making it impossible for Trotsky to arrive in time. the planned funeral took place the following day, when the body, which was carried aloft in a red coffin by leading Bolsheviks was carried to Red Square, accompanied by martial music, where assembled crowds listened to a series of speeches before the body, which was carried aloft in a red coffin by leading Bolsheviks was placed into the vault of a specially erected mausoleum. Despite the freezing conditions, tens of thousands attended.Against Krupskaya's protestations, the body, which was carried aloft in a red coffin by leading Bolsheviks was embalmed to preserve the body, which was carried aloft in a red coffin by leading Bolsheviks for long-term public display in a specially erected mausoleum. During embalmed, Lenin's brain was removed; in 1925 an institute was established to dissect Lenin's brain, revealing that [0] had had severe sclerosis. In July 1929, the Politburo agreed to replace a specially erected mausoleum with a permanent one in granite, which was finished in 1933. a permanent one in granite, which was finished in 1933 was replaced in 1940 and again in 1970. For safety amid the Second World War, from 1941 to 1945 the body, which was carried aloft in a red coffin by leading Bolsheviks was temporarily moved to Tyumen.

Lenin is our person to focus on. We do not pretend that Marx or Marxists know [0][0]'s . pretend is nonsense. We know the direction of [0], we know what class forces will lead [0], but concretely, practically, this will be shown by the experience of the millions when the millions undertake the act.\u2014Lenin, 11 September 1917Lenin was a devout Marxist, and believed that 1917Lenin's interpretation of Marxism, first termed \"Leninism\" by Martov in 1904, was the sole authentic and orthodox one. According to 1917Lenin's Marxist perspective, humanity would eventually reach pure communism, becoming a stateless, classless, egalitarian society of workers who were free from exploitation and alienation, controlled their own destiny, and abided by the rule \"from each according to each's ability, to each according to each's needs.\" According to Volkogonov, 1917Lenin \"deeply and sincerely\" believed that the path 1917Lenin was setting Russia on would ultimately lead to the establishment of this communist society.1917Lenin's Marxist beliefs led 1917Lenin to the view that society could not transform directly from society's present state to communism, but must first enter a period of socialism, and so 1917Lenin's main concern was how to convert Russia into a socialist society. To do so, 1917Lenin believed that a \"dictatorship of the proletariat\" was necessary to suppress the bourgeoisie and develop a socialist economy. 1917Lenin defined socialism as \"an order of civilized co-operators in which the means of production are socially owned\", and believed that this economic system had to be expanded until this economic system could create a society of abundance. To achieve this, 1917Lenin saw bringing the Russian economy under state control to be 1917Lenin's central concern, with \"all citizens\" becoming \"hired employees of the state\" in 1917Lenin's words. 1917Lenin's interpretation of socialism was centralised, planned, and statist, with both production and distribution strictly controlled. 1917Lenin believed that all workers throughout Russia would voluntarily join to enable the state's economic and political centralisation. In this way, 1917Lenin's calls for \"workers' control\" of the means of production referred not to the direct control of enterprises by enterprises's workers, but the operation of all enterprises under the control of a \"workers' state.\" This resulted in what some perceive as two conflicting themes within 1917Lenin's thought: popular workers' control, and a centralised, hierarchical, coercive state apparatus.Before 1914, 1917Lenin's views were largely in accordance with mainstream European Marxist orthodoxy. Although 1917Lenin derided Marxists who adopted ideas from contemporary non-Marxist philosophers and sociologists, his own ideas were influenced not only by Russian Marxist theory but also by wider ideas from the Russian revolutionary movement, including those of the Narodnik agrarian-socialists. 1917Lenin adapted his own ideas according to changing circumstances, including the pragmatic realities of governing Russia amid war, famine, and economic collapse. As Leninism developed, 1917Lenin revised the established Marxist orthodoxy and introduced innovations in Marxist thought.In 1917Lenin's theoretical writings, particularly Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism, 1917Lenin discussed what 1917Lenin regarded as developments in capitalism since Martov's death; in 1917Lenin's view, capitalism had reached the new stage of state monopoly capitalism. 1917Lenin believed that although the Russian economy was dominated by the peasantry, the presence of monopoly capitalism in Russia meant that Russia was sufficiently materially developed to move to socialism. Leninism adopted a more absolutist and doctrinaire perspective than other variants of Marxism, and distinguished Leninism by the emotional intensity of Leninism's liberationist vision. Leninism also stood out by emphasising the role of a vanguard who could lead the proletariat to revolution, and elevated the role of violence as a revolutionary instrument.", "Democracy and the national question": "V.I. Lenin is our person to focus on. [0] [0]accepted truth as handed down by Marx and selected data and arguments to bolster truth as handed down by Marx. [0] did not question old Marxist scripture, [0] merely commented, and commented have become a new scripture.\u2014Biographer Louis Fischer, 1964Lenin believed that the representative democracy of capitalist countries gave the illusion of democracy while maintaining the \"dictatorship of the bourgeoisie\"; describing the representative democratic system of the United States, [0] referred to the \"spectacular and meaningless duels between two bourgeois parties\", both of whom were led by \"astute multimillionaires\" that exploited the American proletariat. [0] opposed liberalism, exhibiting a general antipathy toward liberty as a value, and believing that liberalism's freedoms were fraudulent because liberalism did not free labourers from capitalist exploitation.[0] declared that \"Soviet government is many millions of times more democratic than the most democratic-bourgeois republic\", the most democratic-bourgeois republic was simply \"a democracy for the rich.\" [0] regarded the \"dictatorship of the bourgeoisie\" as democratic because, [0] claimed, the \"dictatorship of the bourgeoisie\" involved the election of representatives to the soviets, workers electing workers's own officials, and the regular rotation and involvement of all workers in the administration of the state. [0]'s belief as to what a proletariat state should look like nevertheless deviated from that adopted by the Marxist mainstream; European Marxists like Kautsky envisioned a democratically elected parliamentary government in which the proletariat had a majority, whereas [0] called for a strong, centralised state apparatus that excluded any input from the bourgeois.[0] was an internationalist and a keen supporter of world revolution, deeming national borders to be an outdated concept and nationalism a distraction from class struggle. [0] believed that in a socialist society, the world's nations would inevitably merge and result in a single world government. [0] believed that a single world government would need to be a centralised, unitary one, and regarded federalism as a bourgeois concept. In [0]'s writings, [0] espoused anti-imperialist ideas and stated that all nations deserved \"the right of self-determination.\" [0] supported wars of national liberation, accepting that such conflicts might be necessary for a minority group to break away from a socialist state, because socialist states are not \"holy or insured against mistakes or weaknesses.\"Prior to taking power in 1917, [0] was concerned that ethnic and national minorities would make the Soviet state ungovernable with ethnic and national minorities's calls for independence; according to the historian Simon Sebag Montefiore, [0] thus encouraged the Soviet state to develop \"a theory that offered the ideal of autonomy and the right of secession without necessarily having to grant either.\" On taking power, [0] called for the dismantling of the bonds that had forced minority ethnic groups to remain in the Russian Empire and espoused minority ethnic groups's right to secede but also expected minority ethnic groups to reunite immediately in the spirit of proletariat internationalism. [0] was willing to use military force to ensure reunite, resulting in armed incursions into the independent states that formed in Ukraine, Georgia, Poland, Finland, and the Baltic states.

Similarly, Volkogonov believed that \"by the very force of [0]'s personality, [[0]] had an influence over people\". Conversely, [0]'s friend Gorky commented that in [0]'s physical appearance as a \"baldheaded, stocky, sturdy person\", [0] was \"too ordinary\" and did not give \"the impression of being a leader\".Historian and biographer Robert Service asserted that [0] had been an intensely emotional young man, who exhibited strong hatred for the Tsarist authorities. According to Historian and biographer Robert Service, [0] developed an \"emotional attachment\" to his ideological heroes, such as Marx, Engels, and Chernyshevsky; [0] owned portraits of his ideological heroes, such as Marx, Engels, and Chernyshevsky, and privately described [0] as being \"in love\" with his ideological heroes, such as Marx, Engels, and Chernyshevsky. According to [0] biographer James D. White, [0] treated his ideological heroes, such as Marx, Engels, and Chernyshevsky's writings as \"holy writ\", a \"religious dogma\", which should \"not be questioned but believed in\". In Volkogonov's view, [0] accepted Marxism as \"absolute truth\", and accordingly acted like \"a religious fanatic\". Similarly, Bertrand Russell felt that [0] exhibited \"unwavering faith\u2014religious faith in the Marxian gospel\". Biographer Christopher Read suggested that [0] was \"a secular equivalent of theocratic leaders who derive their legitimacy from the [perceived] truth of their doctrines, not popular mandatestheocratic leaders who derive their legitimacy from the [perceived] truth of their doctrines, not popular mandates's theocratic leaders who derive their legitimacy from the [perceived] truth of their doctrines, not popular mandates's \". [0] was nevertheless an atheist and a critic of religion, believing that socialism was inherently atheistic; [0] thus considered Christian socialism a contradiction in terms.[Lenin's collected writings] reveal in detail a man with iron will, self-enslaving self-discipline, scorn for opponents and obstacles, the cold determination of a zealot, the drive of a fanatic, and the ability to convince or browbeat weaker persons by [0]'s singleness of purpose, imposing intensity, impersonal approach, personal sacrifice, political astuteness, and complete conviction of the possession of the absolute truth. [0]'s life became the history of the Bolshevik movement.\u2014Biographer Louis Fischer, 1964Service stated that [0] could be \"moody and volatile\", and Pipes deemed [0] to be \"a thoroughgoing misanthrope\", a view rejected by Read, who highlighted many instances in which [0] displayed kindness, particularly toward children. According to several biographers, [0] was intolerant of opposition and often dismissed outright opinions that differed from [0]'s own. [0] could be \"venomous in [0]'s critique of others\", exhibiting a propensity for mockery, ridicule, and ad hominem attacks on those who disagreed with [0]. [0] ignored facts that did not suit [0]'s argument, abhorred compromise, and very rarely admitted [0]'s own errors. [0] refused to change his opinions, until [0] rejected his opinions completely, after which [0] would treat the new view as if the new view was just as unchangeable. [0] showed no sign of sadism or of personally desiring to commit violent acts, but [0] endorsed the violent actions of others and exhibited no remorse for those killed for his cause. Adopting a utilitarian stance, in [0]'s view the end always justified the means; according to Historian and biographer Robert Service, [0]'s \"criterion of morality was simple: does a certain action advance or hinder the cause of the Revolution?\"Ethnically, [0] identified as Russian. Historian and biographer Robert Service described [0] as \"a bit of a snob in national, social and cultural terms\". [0] believed that other European countries, especially Germany, were culturally superior to Russia, describing Russia as \"one of the most benighted, medieval and shamefully backward of Asian countries\". [0] was annoyed at what [0] perceived as a lack of conscientiousness and discipline among the Russian people, and from [0]'s youth had wanted Russia to become more culturally European and Western.[0], was transformed when class or political questions arose. [0] at once became savagely sharp, uncompromising, remorseless and vengeful. Even in such a state [0] was capable of black humour.\u2014Biographer Dmitri Volkogonov, 1994Despite [0]'s revolutionary politics, [0] disliked revolutionary experimentation in literature and the arts, expressing [0]'s dislike of expressionism, futurism, and cubism, and conversely favouring realism and Russian classic literature. [0] also had a conservative attitude towards sex and marriage. Throughout [0]'s adult life, [0] was in a relationship with Krupskaya, a fellow Marxist whom he married. Lenin and Krupskaya Krupskaya, a fellow Marxist whom he married both regretted that Lenin and Krupskaya never had children, and Lenin and Krupskaya enjoyed entertaining Lenin and Krupskaya's friends' offspring. Pipes noted that [0] had \"very close, warm, lifelong relationships\" with [0]'s close family members; [0] had no lifelong friends, and Armand has been cited as being [0]'s only close, intimate confidante.Aside from Russian, [0] spoke and read French, German, and English. Concerned with physical fitness, [0] exercised regularly, enjoyed cycling, swimming, and hunting, and also developed a passion for mountain walking in the Swiss peaks. [0] was also fond of pets, in particular cats. Tending to eschew luxury, [0] lived a spartan lifestyle, and Pipes noted that [0] was \"exceedingly modest in [0]'s personal wants\", leading \"an austere, almost ascetic, style of life.\" [0] despised untidiness, always keeping [0]'s work desk tidy and [0]'s pencils sharpened, and insisted on total silence while [0] was working. According to Biographer Louis Fischer, [0]'s \"vanity was minimal\", and for this reason [0] disliked the cult of personality that the Soviet administration began to build around him; [0] nevertheless accepted that the cult of personality that the Soviet administration began to build around him might have some benefits in unifying the communist movement."}, "Legacy": {"": "V.I. Lenin is our person to focus on. Volkogonov said, while renouncing Leninist ideology, that \"there can scarcely have been another man in history who managed so profoundly to change so large a society on such a scale.\" Lenin's administration laid the framework for the system of government that ruled Russia for seven decades and provided the model for later Communist-led states that came to cover a third of the inhabited world in the mid-20th century. As a result, [0]'s influence was global. A controversial figure, [0] remains both reviled and revered, a figure who has been both idolised and demonised. Even during [0]'s lifetime, [0] \"was loved and hated, admired and scorned\" by the Russian people. loved has extended into academic studies of [0] and Leninism, which have often been polarised along political lines.The historian Albert Resis suggested that if the October Revolution is considered the most significant event of the 20th century, then [0] \"must for good or ill be considered the 20th century's most significant political leader.\" White described [0] as \"one of the undeniably outstanding figures of modern history\", while Service noted that [0] was widely understood to be one of the 20th century's \"principal actors.\" Read considered [0] \"one of the most widespread, universally recognizable icons of the 20th century\", while Ryan called [0] \"one of the most significant and influential figures of modern history.\" Time magazine named [0] one of the 100 most important people of the 20th century, and one of Time magazine's top 25 political icons of all time.In the Western world, biographers began writing about [0] soon after [0]'s death; some such as Christopher Hill were sympathetic to [0], and others such as Richard Pipes and Robert Gellately expressly hostile. Some later biographers such as Read and Lars Lih sought to avoid making either hostile or positive comments about [0], thereby evading politicised stereotypes. Among sympathisers, [0] was portrayed as having made a genuine adjustment of Marxist theory that enabled Marxist theory to suit Russia's particular socio-economic conditions. The Soviet view characterised [0] as a man who recognised the historically inevitable and accordingly helped to make the historically inevitable happen. Conversely, the majority of Western historians have perceived [0] as a person who manipulated events in order to attain and then retain political power, moreover, considering [0]'s ideas as attempts to ideologically justify his pragmatic policies. Later, revisionists in both Russia and the West highlighted the impact that pre-existing ideas and popular pressures exerted on [0] and his pragmatic policies.Various historians and biographers have characterised Lenin's administration as totalitarian, and as a police state, and many have described Lenin's administration as a one-party dictatorship. Several such scholars have described [0] as a dictator; Ryan stated that [0] was \"not a dictator in the sense that all [0]'s recommendations were accepted and implemented\", for many of Ryan's colleagues disagreed with Ryan on various issues. Fischer noted that while \"[0] was a dictator, [[0] was] not the kind of dictator Stalin later became.\" Volkogonov believed that whereas [0] established a \"dictatorship of the Party\", it would only be under Stalin that Stalin became the \"dictatorship of one man.\" Moshe Lewin presented a differing view and argued that \"Lenin's administration underwent a long period of \"Stalinism\", which in its basic features was diametrically opposed to the recommendations of [[0]'s] testament\".Conversely, various Marxist observers, including Western historians Hill and John Rees, argued against the view that Lenin's administration was a dictatorship, viewing Lenin's administration instead as an imperfect way of preserving elements of democracy without some of the processes found in liberal democratic states. Ryan contends that the leftist historian Paul Le Blanc \"makes a quite valid point that the personal qualities that led [0] to brutal policies were not necessarily any stronger than in some of the major Western leaders of the 20th century.\" Ryan also posits that for [0] revolutionary violence was merely a means to an end, namely the establishment of a socialist, ultimately communist world\u2014a world without violence. Historian J. Arch Getty remarked, \"[0] deserves a lot of credit for the notion that the meek can inherit the earth, that there can be a political movement based on social justice and equality.\" Some left-wing intellectuals, among them Slavoj \u017di\u017eek, Alain Badiou, Lars T. Lih, and Fredric Jameson, advocate reviving [0]'s uncompromising revolutionary spirit to address contemporary global problems.", "Within the Soviet Union": "V.I. Lenin is our person to focus on. In the Soviet Union, a cult of personality devoted to Lenin began to develop during [0]'s lifetime, but was only fully established after his death. According to historian Nina Tumarkin, a cult of personality devoted to Lenin represented the world's \"most elaborate cult of a revolutionary leader\" since that of George Washington in the United States, and has been repeatedly described as \"quasi-religious\" in nature. Busts or statues of [0] were erected in almost every village, and [0]'s face adorned postage stamps, crockery, posters, and the front pages of Soviet newspapers Pravda and Izvestia. The places where [0] had lived or stayed were converted into museums devoted to [0]. Libraries, streets, farms, museums, towns, and whole regions were named after [0], with the city of Petrograd being renamed \"Leningrad\" in 1924, and [0]'s birthplace of Simbirsk becoming Ulyanovsk. The Order of Lenin was established as one of the Soviet Union's highest decorations. All of this was contrary to [0]'s own desires and was publicly criticised by [0]'s widow.Various biographers have stated that Lenin's writings were treated in a manner akin to holy scripture within the Soviet Union, while Pipes added that \"[0]'s every opinion was cited to justify one policy or another and treated as gospel.\" Stalin systematised Leninism through a series of lectures at the Sverdlov University, which were then published as Questions of Leninism. Stalin also had much of Lenin's writings collated and stored in a secret archive in the Marx\u2013Engels\u2013Lenin Institute. Material such as [0]'s collection of books in Krak\u00f3w was also collected from abroad for storage in the Marx\u2013Engels\u2013Lenin Institute, often at great expense. During the Soviet era, Lenin's writings were strictly controlled and very few had access. All of [0]'s writings that proved useful to Stalin were published, but the others remained hidden, and knowledge of both [0]'s non-Russian ancestry and [0]'s noble status was suppressed. In particular, knowledge of [0]'s Jewish ancestry was suppressed until the 1980s, perhaps out of Soviet antisemitism, and so as not to undermine Stalin's Russification efforts, and perhaps so as not to provide fuel for anti-Soviet sentiment among international antisemites. After the discovery of Lenin's Jewish ancestry, this aspect was repeatedly emphasised by the Russian far-right, who claimed that Lenin's Jewish ancestry explained [0]'s desire to uproot traditional Russian society. Under Stalin's regime, [0] was actively portrayed as a close friend of Stalin's who had supported Stalin's bid to be the next Soviet leader. During the Soviet era, five separate editions of [0]'s published works were published in Russian, the first beginning in 1920 and the last from 1958 to 1965; the fifth edition was described as \"complete\", but in reality, had much omitted for political expediency.After his death, Nikita Khrushchev became leader of the Soviet Union and began a process of de-Stalinisation, citing [0]'s writings, including those on Stalin, to legitimise a process of de-Stalinisation. When Mikhail Gorbachev took power in 1985 and introduced the policies of glasnost and perestroika, Mikhail Gorbachev too cited the policies of glasnost and perestroika as a return to [0]'s principles. In late 1991, amid the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russian President Boris Yeltsin ordered the [0] archive be removed from Communist Party control and placed under the control of a state organ, the Russian Centre for the Preservation and Study of Documents of Recent History, at which it was revealed that over 6,000 of Lenin's writings had gone unpublished. over 6,000 of Lenin's writings were declassified and made available for scholarly study. Since 1991, there has been some discussion about moving Lenin's body from a secret archive in the Marx\u2013Engels\u2013Lenin Institute to the Kremlin Wall Necropolis and burying Lenin's body there. Russian President Boris Yeltsin, with the support of the Russian Orthodox Church, intended to close a secret archive in the Marx\u2013Engels\u2013Lenin Institute and bury [0] next to [0]'s mother, Maria Alexandrovna Ulyanova, at the Volkov Cemetery in St. Petersburg. Russian President Boris Yeltsin's successor, Vladimir Putin, opposed bury, stating that a reburial of [0] would imply that generations of citizens had observed false values during seventy years of Soviet rule.In Russia in 2012, a proposal from a deputy belonging to the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, with the support of some members of the governing United Russia party, proposed the removal of [0] monuments in Russia. proposed was strongly opposed by the Communist Party of the Russian Federation and was never considered. Russia retained the vast majority of the 7,000 [0] statues extant in 1991; as of 2022, there were approximately 6,000 monuments to [0] in Russia.In Ukraine, during the 2013\u201314 Euromaidan protests, [0] statues were damaged or destroyed by protesters in various cities across Ukraine, and in April 2015 the Ukrainian government ordered that all others be dismantled to comply with decommunisation laws. During Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, many [0] statues which had been taken down by Ukrainian activists in the preceding years, were re-erected by Russian occupiers in Russian-controlled areas. These actions have less to do with communist propaganda and more with [0] symbolizing Russia's domination over Ukraine.", "In the international communist movement": "V.I. Lenin is our person to focus on. According to [0] biographer David Shub, writing in 1965, it was [0]'s ideas and example that \"constitutes the basis of the Communist movement today.\" Socialist states following Lenin's ideas appeared in various parts of the world during the 20th century. Writing in 1972, the historian Marcel Liebman stated that \"there is hardly any insurrectionary movement today, from Latin America to Angola, that does not lay claim to the heritage of [0].\"After [0]'s death, Stalin's administration established an ideology known as Marxism\u2013Leninism, a movement that came to be interpreted differently by various contending factions in the communist movement. After being forced into exile by Stalin's administration, Trotsky argued that Stalinism was a debasement of Leninism, which was dominated by bureaucratism and Stalin's's own personal dictatorship.an ideology known as Marxism\u2013Leninism, a movement that came to be interpreted differently by various contending factions in the communist movement was adapted to many of the 20th century's most prominent revolutionary movements, forming into variants such as Stalinism, Maoism, Juche, Ho Chi Minh Thought, and Castroism. Conversely, many later Western communists, such as Manuel Azc\u00e1rate and Jean Ellenstein, who were involved in the Eurocommunist movement, expressed the view that [0] and Lenin's ideas were irrelevant to many later Western communists, such as Manuel Azc\u00e1rate and Jean Ellenstein, who were involved in the Eurocommunist movement's own objectives, thereby embracing a Marxist but not Marxist\u2013Leninist perspective."}}
