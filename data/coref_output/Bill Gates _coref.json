[0] was born on October 28, 1955, in Seattle, Washington as the only son of William H. Gates Sr. (1925\u20132020) and his first wife, Mary Maxwell Gates (1929\u20131994). [0]'s ancestry includes English, German, and Irish/Scots-Irish. William H. Gates Sr. (1925\u20132020) was a prominent lawyer, and his first wife, Mary Maxwell Gates (1929\u20131994) served on the board of directors of First Interstate BancSystem and United Way of America. [0]'s maternal grandfather was J. W. Maxwell, a national bank president. [0] has an older sister Kristi (Kristianne) and a younger sister Libby. [0] is the fourth of [0]'s name in [0]'s family but is known as William Gates III or \"Trey\" (i.e., three) because William H. Gates Sr. (1925\u20132020) had the \"II\" suffix. The family lived in the Sand Point area of Seattle, Washington in a home that was damaged by a rare tornado when [0] was seven years old.According to [0], when [0] was young, William H. Gates Sr. (1925\u20132020) and his first wife, Mary Maxwell Gates (1929\u20131994) wanted [0] to pursue a career in law. During [0]'s childhood, The family regularly attended a church of the Congregational Christian Churches, a Protestant Reformed denomination. [0] was small for [0]'s age and was bullied as a child. The family encouraged competition; one visitor reported that \"it didn't matter whether it was hearts or pickleball or swimming to the dock; there was always a reward for winning and there was always a penalty for losing\".At age 13, [0] enrolled in the private Lakeside prep school, where he wrote his first software program. When [0] was in eighth grade, the Mothers' Club at the private Lakeside prep school, where he wrote his first software program used proceeds from the private Lakeside prep school, where he wrote his first software program's rummage sale to buy a Teletype Model 33 ASR terminal and a block of computer time on a General Electric (GE) computer for the students. [0] took an interest in programming the GE system in BASIC, and [0] was excused from math classes to pursue an interest in programming the GE system. [0] wrote [0]'s first computer program on a General Electric (GE) computer, an implementation of tic-tac-toe that allowed users to play games against a General Electric (GE) computer. [0] was fascinated by a General Electric (GE) computer and how a General Electric (GE) computer would always execute software code perfectly. After a block of computer time on a General Electric (GE) computer was exhausted, [0] and other students sought time on systems including DEC PDP minicomputers. One of these systems was a PDP-10 belonging to Computer Center Corporation (CCC) which banned Gates, Paul Allen, Ric Weiland, and Gates's best friend and first business partner Kent Evans for the summer after One of these systems caught Gates, Paul Allen, Ric Weiland, and Gates's best friend and first business partner Kent Evans exploiting bugs in the operating system to obtain free computer time.Gates, Paul Allen, Ric Weiland, and Gates's best friend and first business partner Kent Evans formed the Lakeside Programmers Club to make money. At the end of banned, Gates, Paul Allen, Ric Weiland, and Gates's best friend and first business partner Kent Evans offered to find bugs in Computer Center Corporation (CCC)'s software in exchange for extra computer time. Rather than using One of these systems remotely via Teletype, [0] went to Computer Center Corporation (CCC)'s offices and studied source code for various programs that ran on One of these systems, including Fortran, Lisp, and machine language. The arrangement with Computer Center Corporation (CCC) continued until 1970 when Computer Center Corporation (CCC) went out of business.The following year, a the private Lakeside prep school, where he wrote his first software program teacher enlisted Gates and Evans Gates's best friend and first business partner Kent Evans to automate the private Lakeside prep school, where he wrote his first software program's , providing Gates and Evans computer time and royalties in return. Gates and Evans worked diligently in order to have the school's class-scheduling system ready for their senior year. Towards the end of their senior year, Gates's best friend and first business partner Kent Evans was killed in a mountain climbing accident, which [0] has described as one of the saddest days of [0]'s life. [0] then turned to Allen who helped [0] finish the system for the private Lakeside prep school, where he wrote his first software program.At 17, [0] formed a venture with Paul Allen called Traf-O-Data to make traffic counters based on the Intel 8008 processor. In 1972, [0] served as a congressional page in the House of Representatives. [0] was a National Merit Scholar when [0] graduated from the private Lakeside prep school, where he wrote his first software program in 1973. [0] scored 1590 out of 1600 on the Scholastic Aptitude Tests (SAT) and enrolled at Harvard College in the autumn of 1973. [0] chose a pre-law major but took mathematics (including Math 55) and graduate level computer science courses. While at Harvard College, [0] met fellow student and future Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. [0] left Harvard College after two years while fellow student and future Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer stayed and graduated magna cum laude. Years later, fellow student and future Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer later succeeded [0] as Microsoft's CEO and maintained that position from 2000 until fellow student and future Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer's resignation in 2014.Gates devised an algorithm for pancake sorting as a solution to one of a series of unsolved problems presented in a combinatorics class by professor Harry Lewis. an algorithm for pancake sorting held the record as the fastest version for over 30 years, and an algorithm for pancake sorting's successor is faster by only 2%. an algorithm for pancake sorting was formalized and published in collaboration with Harvard College computer scientist Christos Papadimitriou.[0] remained in contact with Paul Allen and joined Paul Allen at Honeywell during the summer of 1974. In 1975, the MITS Altair 8800 was released based on the Intel 8008 processor, and Gates and Evans saw the opportunity to start their own computer software company. [0] dropped out of Harvard College 1975. [0]'s parents were supportive of [0] after seeing how much [0] wanted to start their own computer software company. [0] explained [0]'s Harvard College: \"if things hadn't worked out, [0] could always go back to school. [0] was officially on leave.\""}, "Microsoft": {"BASIC": "[0]  is our person to focus on. [0] read the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics which demonstrated the Altair 8800, and contacted Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS) to inform Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS) that he and others were working on a BASIC interpreter for the platform. In reality, he and others did not have an Altair and had not written code for an Altair; he and others merely wanted to gauge Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS)'s interest. Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS) president Ed Roberts agreed to meet he and others for a demonstration, and over the course of a few weeks he and others developed an the Altair 8800 emulator that ran on a minicomputer, and then a BASIC interpreter for the platform. a demonstration was held at Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS)'s offices in Albuquerque, New Mexico; a demonstration was a success and resulted in a deal with Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS) to distribute a BASIC interpreter for the platform as Altair BASIC. Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS) hired Allen, and [0] took a leave of absence from Harvard to work with Allen at Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS) in November 1975. Allen named their's partnership \"Micro-Soft\", a combination of \"microcomputer\" and \"software\", and their's first office was in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The first employee he and others hired was their's high school collaborator Ric Weiland. he and others dropped the hyphen within a year and officially registered the trade name \"Microsoft\" with the Secretary of New Mexico on November 26, 1976. [0] never returned to Harvard to complete [0]'s studies.Microsoft's Altair BASIC was popular with computer hobbyists, but [0] discovered that a pre-market copy had leaked out and was being widely copied and distributed. In February 1976, [0] wrote an Open Letter to Hobbyists in the MITS newsletter in which [0] asserted that more than 90% of the users of Microsoft's Altair BASIC had not paid Microsoft's for Microsoft's Altair BASIC and the the Altair 8800 \"hobby market\" was in danger of eliminating the incentive for any professional developers to produce, distribute, and maintain high-quality software. an Open Letter to Hobbyists was unpopular with many computer hobbyists, but [0] persisted in [0]'s belief that software developers should be able to demand payment. Microsoft's became independent of Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS) in late 1976, and Microsoft's continued to develop programming language software for various systems. Microsoft's moved from Albuquerque, New Mexico to Bellevue, Washington on January 1, 1979.Gates said [0] personally reviewed and often rewrote every line of code that Microsoft's produced in Microsoft's's first five years. As Microsoft's grew, [0] transitioned into a manager role, then an executive.DONKEY.BAS, is a computer game written in 1981 and included with early versions of the PC DOS operating system distributed with the original IBM PC. It is a driving game in which the player must avoid hitting donkeys. It was written by [0] and Neil Konzen.", "IBM partnership": "Bill Gates  is [0]'s person to focus on. IBM, the leading supplier of computer equipment to commercial enterprises at the time, approached [0] in July 1980 concerning software for IBM, the leading supplier of computer equipment to commercial enterprises at the time,'s , after Bill Gates's mother, Mary Maxwell Gates, mentioned [0] to John Opel, IBM, the leading supplier of computer equipment to commercial enterprises at the time,'s then CEO. IBM, the leading supplier of computer equipment to commercial enterprises at the time, first proposed that [0] write the BASIC interpreter. IBM, the leading supplier of computer equipment to commercial enterprises at the time,'s also mentioned that IBM, the leading supplier of computer equipment to commercial enterprises at the time, needed an operating system, and Bill Gates referred IBM's representatives to Digital Research (DRI), makers of the widely used CP/M operating system. IBM, the leading supplier of computer equipment to commercial enterprises at the time,'s discussions with Digital Research (DRI), makers of the widely used CP/M operating system went poorly, however, and they did not reach a licensing agreement. IBM, the leading supplier of computer equipment to commercial enterprises at the time, representative Jack Sams mentioned the licensing difficulties during a subsequent meeting with Bill Gates and asked if [0] could provide an operating system. A few weeks later, Bill Gates and Allen proposed using 86-DOS, an operating system similar to CP/M, that Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products (SCP) had made for hardware similar to its upcoming personal computer, the IBM PC. [0] made a deal with Seattle Computer Products (SCP) to be the exclusive licensing agent of 86-DOS, an operating system similar to CP/M, that Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products (SCP), and later the full owner. [0] employed Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products (SCP) to adapt 86-DOS, an operating system similar to CP/M, that Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products (SCP) for its upcoming personal computer, the IBM PC and delivered 86-DOS, an operating system similar to CP/M, that Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products (SCP) to IBM, the leading supplier of computer equipment to commercial enterprises at the time, as 86-DOS, an operating system similar to CP/M, that Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products (SCP) for a one-time fee of $50,000.The contract itself only earned [0] a relatively small fee. It was the prestige brought to [0] by IBM, the leading supplier of computer equipment to commercial enterprises at the time,'s adoption of 86-DOS, an operating system similar to CP/M, that Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products (SCP) that would be the origin of [0]'s transformation from a small business to the leading software company in the world. Bill Gates had not offered to transfer the copyright on 86-DOS, an operating system similar to CP/M, that Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products (SCP) to IBM, the leading supplier of computer equipment to commercial enterprises at the time, because Bill Gates believed that other personal computer makers would clone IBM, the leading supplier of computer equipment to commercial enterprises at the time,'s hardware. other personal computer makers did, making the IBM, the leading supplier of computer equipment to commercial enterprises at the time,-compatible PC, running 86-DOS, an operating system similar to CP/M, that Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products (SCP), a de facto standard. The sales of MS-DOS (the version of 86-DOS, an operating system similar to CP/M, that Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products (SCP) sold to customers other than IBM, the leading supplier of computer equipment to commercial enterprises at the time,) made [0] a major player in the industry. The press quickly identified [0] as being very influential on its upcoming personal computer, the IBM PC. PC Magazine asked if Bill Gates was \"the man behind the machine?\".Bill Gates oversaw [0]'s company restructuring on June 25, 1981, which re-incorporated [0] in Washington state and made Bill Gates the president and chairman of the board, with Allen as vice president and vice chairman. In early 1983, Allen left [0] after receiving a Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosis, effectively ending the formal business partnership between Gates and Allen, which had been strained months prior due to a contentious dispute over [0] equity. Later in the decade, Bill Gates repaired Bill Gates's relationship with Allen and together Gates and Allen donated millions to Gates and Allen's childhood school Lakeside. Gates and Allen remained friends until Allen's death in October 2018.", "Windows": "[0]  is our person to focus on. Microsoft and Gates launched Microsoft and Gates's first retail version of Microsoft Windows on November 20, 1985, in an attempt to fend off competition from Apple's Macintosh GUI, which had captivated consumers with its simplicity and ease of use. In August 1986, Microsoft and Gates struck a deal with IBM to develop a separate operating system called OS/2. Although Microsoft and Gates successfully developed the first version of the new system, a deal with IBM deteriorated due to mounting creative differences. the new system grew out of DOS in an organic fashion over a decade until Windows 95, which hid the DOS prompt by default. Windows XP was released one year after [0] stepped down as Microsoft CEO. Windows 8.1 was the last version of the new system released before [0] left the chair of Microsoft and Gates to John W. Thompson on February 5, 2014.", "Management style": "[0]  is our person to focus on. During Microsoft's's early years, [0] was an active software developer, particularly in Microsoft's's programming language products, but [0]'s primary role in most of Microsoft's's history was as a manager and executive. [0] has not officially been on a development team since working on the TRS-80 Model 100, but [0] wrote code that shipped with Microsoft's's products as late as 1989. Jerry Pournelle wrote in 1985 when [0] announced Microsoft Excel: \"[0] likes Microsoft Excel, not because Microsoft Excel's going to make [0] a lot of money (although Jerry Pournelle'm sure Microsoft Excel will do make), but because Microsoft Excel's a neat hack.\"On June 15, 2006, [0] announced that [0] would transition out of [0]'s role at Microsoft's to dedicate more time to philanthropy. [0] gradually divided his responsibilities between two successors when [0] placed Ray Ozzie in charge of management and Craig Mundie in charge of long-term product strategy. divided took two years to fully transfer his responsibilities to two successorsCraig Mundie, and was completed on June 27, 2008.", "Post-Microsoft": "[0]  is our person to focus on.

As of January\u00a02014[update], most of [0]'s assets are held in Cascade Investment LLC, an entity through which [0] owns stakes in numerous businesses, including Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, and Corbis Corp. On February 4, 2014, [0] stepped down as chairman of Microsoft to become \"technology advisor\" at Microsoft to support newly appointed CEO Satya Nadella.[0] provided [0]'s perspective on a range of issues in a substantial interview that was published in the March 27, 2014, issue of Rolling Stone magazine. In a substantial interview that was published in the March 27, 2014, issue of Rolling Stone magazine, [0] provided [0]'s perspective on climate change, his charitable activities, various tech companies and people involved in his charitable activities, and the state of America. In response to a question about [0]'s greatest fear when [0] looks 50 years into the future, [0] stated: \"there'll be some really bad things that'll happen in the next 50 or 100 years, but hopefully none of some really bad things that'll happen in the next 50 or 100 years on the scale of, say, a million people that you didn't expect to die from a pandemic, or nuclear or bioterrorism.\" [0] also identified innovation as the \"real driver of progress\" and pronounced that \"the state of America's way better today than the state of America's ever been.[0] has often expressed concern about the potential harms of superintelligence; in a Reddit \"ask me anything\", [0] stated that:First the machines will do a lot of jobs for us and not be super intelligent. That should be positive if us manage it well. A few decades after that though the intelligence is strong enough to be a concern. [0] agree with Elon Musk and some others on this and don't understand why some people are not concerned. In an interview that was held at the TED conference in March 2015, with Baidu co-founder and CEO, Robin Li, [0] said [0] would \"highly recommend\" Nick Bostrom's recent work, Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies. During the TED conference, [0] warned that the world was not prepared for the next pandemic, a situation that would come to pass in late 2019 when the next pandemic began. In March 2018, [0] met at [0]'s home in Seattle with Mohammed bin Salman, the reformist crown prince and de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia to discuss investment opportunities for Saudi Vision 2030. In June 2019, [0] admitted that losing the mobile operating system race to Android was [0]'s biggest mistake. [0] stated that losing was within Android's skill set of being the dominant player, but partially blames the antitrust litigation during the time. June 2019, [0] became an advisory board member of the Bloomberg New Economy Forum.On March 13, 2020, Microsoft announced [0] would be leaving [0]'s board positions at Berkshire Hathaway and Microsoft to dedicate [0] to philanthropic endeavors such as climate change, global health and development, and education.During the next pandemic, [0] has widely been looked at by media outlets as an expert on the next pandemic, despite [0] not being a public official or having any prior medical training. [0]'s foundation did, however, establish the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator in 2020 to hasten the development and evaluation of new and repurposed drugs and biologics to treat patients for COVID-19, and, as of February 2021, [0] expressed that [0] and Anthony Fauci frequently talk and collaborate on matters including vaccines and other medical innovations to fight the next pandemic.", "": ""}, "Business ventures and investments (partial list)": {"": "[0]  is our person to focus on.

[0] considers climate change and global access to energy to be critical, interrelated issues. [0] has urged governments and the private sector to invest in research and development to make clean, reliable energy cheaper. [0] envisions that a breakthrough innovation in sustainable energy technology could drive down both greenhouse gas emissions and poverty, and bring economic benefits by stabilizing energy prices. In 2011, [0] said: \"If you gave [0] the choice between picking the next 10 presidents or ensuring that energy is environmentally friendly and a quarter as costly, [0]'d pick the energy thing.\"In 2015, [0] wrote about the challenge of transitioning the world's's energy system from one based primarily on fossil fuels to one based on sustainable energy sources. Global energy transitions have historically taken decades. [0] wrote, \"[0] believe we can make transitioning faster, both because the pace of innovation is accelerating, and because we have never had such an urgent reason to move from one source of energy to another.\" transitioning, according to [0], would depend on increased government funding for basic research and financially risky private-sector investment, to enable innovation in diverse areas such as nuclear energy, grid energy storage to facilitate greater use of solar and wind energy, and solar fuels.[0] spearheaded two initiatives that [0] announced at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris. One was Mission Innovation, in which 20 national governments pledged to double 20 national governments's spending on research and development for carbon-free energy in over five years' time. Another initiative was Breakthrough Energy, a group of investors who agreed to fund high-risk startups in clean energy technologies. [0][0]'s , committed a further $1 billion to Breakthrough Energy, a group of investors who agreed to fund high-risk startups in clean energy technologies. In December 2020, [0] called for the U.S. federal government to create institutes for clean energy research, analogous to the National Institutes of Health. [0] has also urged rich nations to shift to 100% synthetic beef industries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from food production.[0] has been criticised for holding a large stake in Signature Aviation, a company that services emissions-intensive private jets. In 2019, [0] began to divest from fossil fuels. [0] does not expect divest divest to have much practical impact, but says that if [0]'s efforts to provide alternatives were to fail, [0] would not want to personally benefit from an increase in fossil fuel stock prices. After [0] published his book How to Avoid a Climate Disaster, parts of the climate activist community criticized [0]'s approach as technological solutionism. In 2022, educational streamer Wondrium produced the series \"Solving for Zero: The Search for Climate Innovation\" inspired by his book How to Avoid a Climate Disaster.In June 2021, [0]'s company TerraPower and Warren Buffett's PacifiCorp announced the first sodium nuclear reactor in Wyoming. Wyoming Governor Mike Gordon hailed the first sodium nuclear reactor in Wyoming as a step toward carbon-negative nuclear power. Wyoming Senator John Barrasso also said that the first sodium nuclear reactor in Wyoming could boost Wyoming's once-active uranium mining industry.[0] spent many efforts to make pass the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 because of [0]'s importance to climate. [0] tried to convince Joe Manchin to support a climate bill from the year 2019 and especially in the months before the adoption of a climate bill from the year 2019. a climate bill from the year 2019 should cut the global greenhouse gas emissions in a level similar to \"eliminating the annual planet-warming pollution of France and Germany combined\" and may help to limit the warming of the world's to 1.5 degrees \u2013 the target of the Paris Agreement.
