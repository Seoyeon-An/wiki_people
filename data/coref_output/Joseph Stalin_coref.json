[0] held power as General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (1922\u20131952) and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union (1941\u20131953). Initially governing the Soviet Union as part of a collective leadership, [0] consolidated power to become a dictator by the 1930s. Ideologically adhering to the Leninist interpretation of Marxism, [0] formalised these ideas as Marxism\u2013Leninism, while [0]'s own policies are called Stalinism.Born to a poor family in Gori in the Russian Empire (now Georgia), [0] attended the Tbilisi Spiritual Seminary before joining the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. [0] edited the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party's newspaper, Pravda, and raised funds for Vladimir Lenin's Bolshevik faction via robberies, kidnappings and protection rackets. Repeatedly arrested, [0] underwent several internal exiles to Siberia. After Vladimir Lenin's Bolshevik faction seized power in the October Revolution and created a one-party state under the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1917, [0] joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union's governing Politburo. Serving in the Russian Civil War before overseeing the Soviet Union's establishment in 1924, [0] assumed leadership over the Soviet Union following Vladimir Lenin's's death in 1924. Under [0], socialism in one country became a central tenet of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union's ideology. As a result of [0]'s Five-Year Plans, the Soviet Union underwent agricultural collectivisation and rapid industrialisation, creating a centralised command economy. Severe disruptions to food production contributed to the famine of 1930\u201333, including the Asharshylyk in Kazakhstan and the Holodomor in Ukraine. To eradicate accused \"enemies of the working class\", [0] instituted the Great Purge, in which over a million were imprisoned, largely in the Gulag system of forced labour camps, and at least 700,000 executed between 1934 and 1939. By 1937, [0] had absolute control over the party and government.[0] promoted Marxism\u2013Leninism abroad through the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and supported European anti-fascist movements during the 1930s, particularly in the Spanish Civil War. In 1939, [0]'s regime signed a non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany, resulting in the Soviet invasion of Poland. Nazi Germany ended a non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany by invading the Soviet Union in 1941. Despite initial catastrophes, the Soviet Red Army repelled invading and captured Berlin in 1945, ending World War II in Europe. Amid World War II in Europe, the Soviets annexed the Baltic states and Bessarabia and North Bukovina, subsequently establishing Soviet-aligned governments throughout Central and Eastern Europe and in parts of East Asia. the Soviet Union and the United States emerged as global superpowers and entered a period of tension, the Cold War. [0] presided over the Soviet post-war reconstruction and the Soviet Union's development of an atomic bomb in 1949. During these years, the Soviet Union experienced another major famine and an antisemitic campaign that culminated in the doctors' plot. After [0]'s death in 1953, [0] was eventually succeeded by Nikita Khrushchev, who subsequently denounced his rule and initiated the de-Stalinisation of Soviet society.Widely considered to be one of the 20th century's most significant figures, [0] was the subject of a pervasive personality cult within the international Marxist\u2013Leninist movement, which revered [0] as a champion of the working class and socialism. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, [0] has retained popularity in Russia and Georgia as a victorious wartime leader who cemented the Soviet Union's status as a leading world power. Conversely, his rule has been widely condemned for overseeing mass repression, ethnic cleansing, wide-scale deportation, hundreds of thousands of executions, and famines that killed millions."}, "Early life": {"1878\u20131899: Childhood to young adulthood": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was born in Georgia in the town of Gori, then part of the Tiflis Governorate of the Russian Empire and home to a mix of Georgians, Azerbaijanis, Armenians, Russians, and Jews. [0] was born on 18 December\u00a0[O.S. 6 December]\u00a01878 and baptised on 29 December. [0]'s birth name was Ioseb Besarionis dze Jughashvili, and [0] was nicknamed \"Soso\", a diminutive of \"Ioseb\". His parents were Besarion Jughashvili and Ekaterine Geladze. [0] was His parents's only child to survive past infancy.Besarion Jughashvili was a cobbler who was employed in a workshop owned by another man; a workshop owned by another man was initially a financial success but later fell into decline, and the family found the family living in poverty. Besarion Jughashvili became an alcoholic and drunkenly beat Besarion Jughashvili's wife and son. Ekaterine Geladze and [0] left the home by 1883 and began a wandering life, moving through nine different rented rooms over the next decade. In 1886, the family moved into the house of a family friend, Father Christopher Charkviani. Ekaterine Geladze worked as a house cleaner and launderer and was determined to send Ekaterine Geladze's to school. In September 1888, [0] enrolled at the Orthodox Gori Church School, a place secured by a family friend, Father Christopher Charkviani. Although [0] got into many fights, [0] excelled academically, displaying talent in painting and drama classes, writing [0]'s own poetry, and singing as a choirboy. [0] faced several severe health problems: An 1884 smallpox infection left [0] with facial scars; and at age 12 [0] was seriously injured when [0] was hit by a phaeton, probably the cause of a lifelong disability in [0]'s left arm.In August 1894, [0] enrolled in the Russian Orthodox Theological Seminary in Tiflis, enabled by a scholarship that allowed [0] to study at a reduced rate. [0] joined 600 trainee priests who boarded there, and [0] achieved high grades. [0] continued writing poetry; five of his poems, on themes such as nature, land and patriotism, were published under the pseudonym of \"Soselo\" in Ilia Chavchavadze's newspaper Iveria (Georgia). According to [0]'s biographer Simon Sebag Montefiore, five of his poems, on themes such as nature, land and patriotism became \"minor Georgian classics\" and were included in various anthologies of Georgian poetry over the coming years. As [0] grew older, [0] lost interest in priestly studies, [0]'s grades dropped, and [0] was repeatedly confined to a cell for [0]'s rebellious behaviour. the Russian Orthodox Theological Seminary in Tiflis's journal noted that [0] declared [0] an atheist, stalked out of prayers and refused to doff [0]'s hat to monks.[0] joined a forbidden book club at the Russian Orthodox Theological Seminary in Tiflis; [0] was particularly influenced by Nikolay Chernyshevsky's 1863 pro-revolutionary novel What Is To Be Done? Another influential text was Alexander Kazbegi's The Patricide, with [0] adopting the nickname \"Koba\" from that of Alexander Kazbegi's The Patricide's bandit protagonist. the nickname \"Koba\" may also have been a tribute to his wealthy benefactor, Yakobi \"Koba\" Egnatashvili, who paid for his schooling at the Tiflis seminary. (\"Koba\" is the Georgian diminutive of Yakobi, or Jacob, and [0] later named [0]'s first-born son in his wealthy benefactor, Yakobi \"Koba\" Egnatashvili, who paid for his schooling at the Tiflis seminary's honour.) [0] also read Das Kapital, the 1867 book by German sociological theorist Karl Marx. [0] devoted [0] to German sociological theorist Karl Marx's socio-political theory, Marxism, which was then on the rise in Georgia, one of various forms of socialism opposed to the Russian Empire's authorities. At night, [0] attended secret workers' meetings and was introduced to Silibistro \"Silva\" Jibladze, the Marxist founder of Mesame Dasi (\"Third Group\"), a Georgian socialist group. [0] left the Russian Orthodox Theological Seminary in Tiflis in April 1899 and never returned.", "1899\u20131904: Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party": "[0] is our person to focus on. In October 1899, [0] began work as a meteorologist at the Tiflis observatory. [0] had a light workload and therefore had plenty of time for revolutionary activity. [0] attracted a group of supporters through [0]'s classes in socialist theory and co-organised a secret workers' mass meeting for May Day 1900, at which [0] successfully encouraged many of the men to take strike action. By this point, the empire's secret police, the Okhrana, were aware of [0]'s activities in Tiflis' revolutionary milieu. the empire's secret police, the Okhrana, attempted to arrest [0] in March 1901, but [0] escaped and went into hiding, living off the donations of friends and sympathisers. Remaining underground, [0] helped plan a demonstration for May Day 1901, in which 3,000 marchers clashed with the authorities. [0] continued to evade arrest by using aliases and sleeping in different apartments. In November 1901, [0] was elected to the Tiflis Committee of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP), a Marxist party founded in 1898.That month, [0] travelled to the port city of Batumi. [0]'s militant rhetoric proved divisive among the port city of Batumi's Marxists, some of whom suspected that [0] might be an agent provocateur working for the empire's. [0] found employment at the Rothschild refinery storehouse, where [0] co-organised two workers' strikes. After several strike leaders were arrested, [0] co-organised a mass public demonstration which led to the storming of the prison; troops fired upon the demonstrators, 13 of whom were killed. [0] organised another mass demonstration on the day of the demonstrators, 13 of whom were killed's funeral, before being arrested in April 1902. Held first in the port city of Batumi Prison and then Kutaisi Prison, in mid-1903 [0] was sentenced to three years of exile in eastern Siberia.[0] left the port city of Batumi in October, arriving at the small Siberian town of Novaya Uda in late November 1903. There, [0] lived in a two-room peasant's house, sleeping in a two-room peasant's house's larder. [0] made two escape attempts: On the first, [0] made it to Balagansk before returning due to frostbite. [0]'s second attempt, in January 1904, was successful and [0] made it to Tiflis. There, [0] co-edited a Georgian Marxist newspaper, Proletariatis Brdzola (\"Proletarian Struggle\"), with Filipp Makharadze. [0] called for the Georgian Marxist movement to split from the Georgian Marxist movement's Russian counterpart, resulting in several RSDLP members accusing [0] of holding views contrary to the ethos of Marxist internationalism and calling for [0]'s expulsion from RSDLP; [0] soon recanted views contrary to the ethos of Marxist internationalism. During [0]'s exile, RSDLP had split between Vladimir Lenin's \"Bolsheviks\" and Julius Martov's \"Mensheviks\". [0] detested many of the Mensheviks in Georgia and aligned [0] with Vladimir Lenin's \"Bolsheviks\". Although [0] established a Bolshevik stronghold in the mining town of Chiatura, Bolshevism remained a minority force in the Menshevik-dominated Georgian revolutionary scene.", "1905\u20131912: Revolution of 1905 and its aftermath": "Joseph Stalin is our person to focus on. In January [0], government troops massacred protesters in Saint Petersburg. Unrest soon spread across the Russian Empire in what came to be known as the Revolution of [0]. Georgia was particularly affected. Joseph Stalin was in Baku in February when ethnic violence broke out between Armenians and Azeris; at least 2,000 were killed. Joseph Stalin publicly lambasted the \"pogroms against Jews and Armenians\" as being part of Tsar Nicholas II's's attempts to \"buttress Tsar Nicholas II's's despicable throne\". Joseph Stalin formed a Bolshevik Battle Squad which Joseph Stalin used to try to keep Baku's warring ethnic factions apart; Joseph Stalin also used Unrest as a cover for stealing printing equipment. Amid the growing violence throughout Georgia Joseph Stalin formed further Battle Squads, with the Mensheviks doing the same. further Battle Squads disarmed local police and troops, raided government arsenals, and raised funds through protection rackets on large local businesses and mines. further Battle Squads launched attacks on the government's Cossack troops and pro-Tsarist Black Hundreds, co-ordinating some of further Battle Squads's operations with the Menshevik militia.In November [0], the Georgian Bolsheviks elected Joseph Stalin as one of the Georgian Bolsheviks's delegates to a Bolshevik conference in Saint Petersburg. On arrival, Joseph Stalin met Lenin's's wife Nadezhda Krupskaya, who informed Joseph Stalin that the venue had been moved to Tampere in the Grand Duchy of Finland. At a Bolshevik conference in Saint Petersburg Joseph Stalin met Lenin's for the first time. Although Joseph Stalin held Lenin's in deep respect, Joseph Stalin was vocal in Joseph Stalin's disagreement with Lenin's's view that the Bolsheviks should field candidates for the forthcoming election to the State Duma; Joseph Stalin saw the parliamentary process as a waste of time. In April 1906, Joseph Stalin attended the RSDLP Fourth Congress in Stockholm; the RSDLP Fourth Congress in Stockholm was Joseph Stalin's first trip outside the Russian Empire. At the RSDLP Fourth Congress in Stockholm, RSDLP RSDLP's agreed that RSDLP would not raise funds using armed robbery. Lenin and Stalin disagreed with agreed and later privately discussed how Lenin and Stalin could continue the robberies for the Bolshevik cause.Joseph Stalin married Kato Svanidze in an Orthodox church ceremony at Senaki in July 1906. In March 1907 Kato Svanidze bore a son, Yakov. By 1907 \u2014 according to the historian Robert Service \u2014 Joseph Stalin had established Joseph Stalin as \"Georgia's leading Bolshevik\". Joseph Stalin attended the Fifth RSDLP Congress, held at the Brotherhood Church in London in May\u2013June 1907. After returning to Tiflis, Joseph Stalin organised the robbing of a large delivery of money to the Imperial Bank in June 1907. His gang ambushed the armed convoy in Erivansky Square with gunfire and home-made bombs. Around 40 people were killed, but all of His gang escaped alive. After the robbing of a large delivery of money to the Imperial Bank, Joseph Stalin settled in Baku with Kato Svanidze and son. There, Mensheviks confronted Joseph Stalin about the robbing of a large delivery of money to the Imperial Bank and voted to expel Joseph Stalin from RSDLP, but Joseph Stalin took no notice of Mensheviks.In Baku, Joseph Stalin secured Bolshevik domination of the local RSDLP branch and edited two Bolshevik newspapers, Bakinsky Proletary and Gudok (\"Whistle\"). In August 1907, Joseph Stalin attended the Seventh Congress of the Second International \u2014 an international socialist organisation \u2014 in Stuttgart, German Empire. In November 1907, Kato Svanidze died of typhus, and Joseph Stalin left a son, Yakov with Kato Svanidze's family in Tiflis. In Baku Joseph Stalin had reassembled His gang. His gang also kidnapped the children of several wealthy figures to extract ransom money. In early 1908, Joseph Stalin travelled to the Swiss city of Geneva to meet with Lenin's and the prominent Russian Marxist Georgi Plekhanov, although the prominent Russian Marxist Georgi Plekhanov exasperated Joseph Stalin.In March 1908, Joseph Stalin was arrested and interned in Bailov Prison in Baku. There Joseph Stalin led the imprisoned Bolsheviks, organised discussion groups, and ordered the killing of suspected informants. Joseph Stalin was eventually sentenced to two years exile in the village of Solvychegodsk, Vologda Province, arriving there in February 1909. In June 1907, Joseph Stalin escaped the village of Solvychegodsk, Vologda Province and made it to Kotlas disguised as a woman and from there to Saint Petersburg. In March 1910, Joseph Stalin was arrested again and sent back to Solvychegodsk. There Joseph Stalin had affairs with at least two women; Joseph Stalin's landlady, Maria Kuzakova, later gave birth to Joseph Stalin's second son, Konstantin. In June 1911, Joseph Stalin was given permission to move to Vologda, where Joseph Stalin stayed for two months, having a relationship with Pelageya Onufrieva. Joseph Stalin escaped to Saint Petersburg, where Joseph Stalin was arrested in September 1911 and sentenced to a further three-year exile in Vologda Province.", "1912\u20131917: Rise to the Central Committee and editorship of Pravda": "[0] is our person to focus on. In January 1912, while [0] was in exile, the first Bolshevik Central Committee was elected at the Prague Conference. Shortly after the Prague Conference, Lenin and Grigory Zinoviev decided to co-opt [0] to the first Bolshevik Central Committee. Still in Vologda, [0] agreed, remaining a the first Bolshevik Central Committee member for the rest of his life. Lenin believed that Stalin, as a Georgian, would help secure support for the Bolsheviks from the empire's's minority ethnicities. In February 1912, [0] again escaped to Saint Petersburg, tasked with converting the Bolshevik weekly newspaper, Zvezda (\"Star\") into a daily, Pravda (\"Truth\"). a daily, Pravda (\"Truth\") was launched in April 1912, although [0]'s role as editor was kept secret.In May 1912, [0] was arrested again and imprisoned in the Shpalerhy Prison, before being sentenced to three years exile in Siberia. In July, [0] arrived at the Siberian village of Narym, where [0] shared a room with a fellow Bolshevik Yakov Sverdlov. After two months, [0] and a fellow Bolshevik Yakov Sverdlov escaped back to Saint Petersburg. During a brief period back in Tiflis, [0] and the Outfit planned the ambush of a mail coach, during which most of the Outfit \u2014 although not [0] \u2014 were apprehended by the authorities. [0] returned to Saint Petersburga daily, Pravda (\"Truth\").After the October 1912 Duma elections, where six Bolsheviks and six Mensheviks were elected, [0] wrote articles calling for reconciliation between the two Marxist factions, for which Lenin criticised [0]. In late 1912, [0] twice crossed into the Austro-Hungarian Empire to visit Lenin in Cracow, eventually bowing to Lenin's opposition to reunification with the Mensheviks. In January 1913, [0] travelled to Vienna, where [0] researched the \"national question\" of how the Bolsheviks should deal with the Russian Empire's national and ethnic minorities. Lenin, who encouraged [0] to write an article on the subjectthe \"national question\" of how the Bolsheviks should deal with the Russian Empire's national and ethnic minorities, wanted to attract those groups to the Bolshevik cause by offering those groups the right of secession from the empire's, but also hoped those groups would remain part of a future Bolshevik-governed Russia.an article on the subject was first published in the March, April, and May 1913 issues of the Bolshevik journal Prosveshcheniye; Lenin was pleased with an article on the subject. According to Montefiore, an article on the subject was \"[0]'s most famous work\". an article on the subject was published under the pseudonym \"K. Stalin\", a name he had used since 1912. Derived from the Russian word for steel (stal), the pseudonym \"K. Stalin\", a name he had used since 1912 has been translated as \"Man of Steel\"; [0] may have intended the pseudonym \"K. Stalin\", a name he had used since 1912 to imitate Lenin's pseudonym. [0] retained the pseudonym \"K. Stalin\", a name he had used since 1912 for the rest of his life, possibly because the pseudonym \"K. Stalin\", a name he had used since 1912 was used on an article on the subject.In February 1913, [0] was arrested while back in Saint Petersburg. [0] was sentenced to four years exile in Turukhansk, a remote part of Siberia from which escape was particularly difficult. In August, [0] arrived in the village of Monastyrskoe, although after four weeks was relocated to the hamlet of Kostino. In March 1914, concerned over a potential escape attempt, the authorities moved [0] to the hamlet of Kureika on the edge of the Arctic Circle. In the hamlet of Kureika on the edge of the Arctic Circle, [0] had a relationship with Lidia Pereprygina, who was fourteen at the time but within the legal age of consent in the empire's. In or about December 1914, their child was born but their child soon died. their's second child, Alexander, was born circa April 1917.In the hamlet of Kureika on the edge of the Arctic Circle, [0] lived among the indigenous Tunguses and Ostyak peoples, and spent much of [0]'s time fishing.", "1917: Russian Revolution": "[0] is our person to focus on. While [0] was in exile, Russia entered the First World War, and in October 1916 Stalin and other exiled Bolsheviks were conscripted into the Russian Army, leaving for Monastyrskoe. Stalin and other exiled Bolsheviks arrived in Krasnoyarsk in February 1917, where a medical examiner ruled [0] unfit for military service because of [0]'s crippled arm. [0] was required to serve four more months of his exile, and [0] successfully requested that [0] serve four more months of his exile in nearby Achinsk. [0] was in nearby Achinsk when the February Revolution took place; uprisings broke out in Petrograd \u2014 as Saint Petersburg had been renamed \u2014 and Tsar Nicholas II abdicated to escape being violently overthrown. Russia became a de facto republic, headed by a Provisional Government dominated by liberals. In a celebratory mood, [0] travelled by train to Petrograd \u2014 as Saint Petersburg had been renamed in March. There, [0] and a fellow Bolshevik Lev Kamenev assumed control of Pravda, and [0] was appointed the Bolshevik representative to the executive committee of the Petrograd Soviet, an influential council of Petrograd \u2014 as Saint Petersburg had been renamed's workers. In April, [0] came third in the Bolshevik elections for the party's Central Committee; Lenin came first and Zinoviev came second. came reflected [0]'s senior standing in the party's at the time.The existing government of landlords and capitalists must be replaced by a new government, a government of workers and peasants.The existing pseudo-government which was not elected by the people and which is not accountable to the people must be replaced by a government recognised by the people, elected by representatives of the workers, soldiers and peasants and held accountable to representatives of the workers, soldiers and peasants's representatives.\u2014 [0]'s editorial in Pravda, October 1917Stalin helped organise the July Days uprising, an armed display of strength by Bolshevik supporters. After the July Days uprising, an armed display of strength by Bolshevik supporters was suppressed, a Provisional Government dominated by liberals initiated a crackdown on the Bolsheviks, raiding Pravda. During raiding, [0] smuggled Lenin out of Pravda's office and took charge of Lenin's safety, moving Lenin between Petrograd \u2014 as Saint Petersburg had been renamed safe houses before smuggling Lenin to Razliv. In Lenin's absence, [0] continued editing Pravda and served as acting leader of the Bolsheviks, overseeing the Bolsheviks's Sixth Congress, which was held covertly. Lenin began calling for the Bolsheviks to seize power by toppling a Provisional Government dominated by liberals in a coup d'\u00e9tat. [0] and a fellow senior Bolshevik Leon Trotsky both endorsed Lenin's plan of action, but Lenin's plan of action was initially opposed by a fellow Bolshevik Lev Kamenev and other party members. Lenin returned to Petrograd \u2014 as Saint Petersburg had been renamed and secured a majority in favour of a coup d'\u00e9tat at a meeting of the party's Central Committee on 10 October.On 24 October, police raided the Bolshevik newspaper offices, smashing machinery and presses; [0] salvaged some of this equipment to continue [0]'s activities. In the early hours of 24 October, [0] joined Lenin in a the party's Central Committee meeting in the Smolny Institute, from where a coup d'\u00e9tat was directed. Bolshevik militia seized Petrograd \u2014 as Saint Petersburg had been renamed's electric power station, main post office, state bank, telephone exchange, and several bridges. A Bolshevik-controlled ship, the Aurora, opened fire on the Winter Palace; a Provisional Government dominated by liberals's assembled delegates surrendered and were arrested by the Bolsheviks. Although [0] had been tasked with briefing the Bolshevik delegates of the Second Congress of Soviets about the developing situation, [0]'s role in a coup d'\u00e9tat had not been publicly visible. a fellow senior Bolshevik Leon Trotsky and other later Bolshevik opponents of [0] used been as evidence that [0]'s role in a coup d'\u00e9tat had been insignificant, although later historians reject this. According to the historian Oleg Khlevniuk, [0] \"filled an important role [in a coup d'\u00e9tat]... as a senior Bolshevik, member of the party's Central Committee, and editor of the Bolsheviks's \"; the historian Stephen Kotkin similarly noted that [0] had been \"in the thick of events\" in the build-up to a coup d'\u00e9tat.", "": ""}, "In Lenin's government": {"1917\u20131918: Consolidating power": "Joseph Stalin is our person to focus on. On 26 October 1917, [0] declared [0] chairman of a new government, the Council of People's Commissars (\"Sovnarkom\"). Joseph Stalin backed [0]'s decision not to form a coalition with the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionary Party, although a new government, the Council of People's Commissars (\"Sovnarkom\") did form a coalition government with the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries. Joseph Stalin became part of an informal foursome leading a new government, the Council of People's Commissars (\"Sovnarkom\"), alongside Lenin, Trotsky, and Sverdlov; of Lenin, Trotsky, and Sverdlov, Sverdlov was regularly absent and died in March 1919. Joseph Stalin's office was based near to [0]'s in the Smolny Institute, and Joseph Stalin and Trotsky were the only individuals allowed access to [0]'s study without an appointment. Although not so publicly well known as [0] or Trotsky, Joseph Stalin's importance among the Bolsheviks grew. Joseph Stalin co-signed [0]'s decrees shutting down hostile newspapers, and along with Sverdlov, Joseph Stalin chaired the sessions of the committee drafting a constitution for the new Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. Joseph Stalin strongly supported [0]'s formation of the Cheka security service and the subsequent Red Terror that the Cheka security service initiated; noting that state violence had proved an effective tool for capitalist powers, Joseph Stalin believed that state violence would prove the same for a new government, the Council of People's Commissars (\"Sovnarkom\"). Unlike senior Bolsheviks like Kamenev and Nikolai Bukharin, Joseph Stalin never expressed concern about the rapid growth and expansion of the Cheka and Red Terror.Having dropped Joseph Stalin's editorship of Pravda, Joseph Stalin was appointed the People's Commissar for Nationalities. Joseph Stalin took Nadezhda Alliluyeva as Joseph Stalin's secretary and at some point, married Nadezhda Alliluyeva, although the wedding date is unknown. In November 1917, Joseph Stalin signed the Decree on Nationality, according ethnic and national minorities living in the new Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic the right of secession and self-determination. the Decree on Nationality's purpose was primarily strategic; the Bolsheviks wanted to gain favour among ethnic minorities but hoped that ethnic minorities would not actually desire independence. November 1917, Joseph Stalin travelled to Helsingfors to talk with the Finnish Social Democrats, granting Finland's request for independence in December. Joseph Stalin's department allocated funds for establishment of presses and schools in the languages of various ethnic minorities. Socialist revolutionaries accused Joseph Stalin's talk of federalism and national self-determination as a front for Sovnarkom's centralising and imperialist policies.Because of the ongoing First World War, in which the new Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic was fighting the Central Powers of Germany and Austria-Hungary, [0]'s government relocated from Petrograd to Moscow in March 1918. Joseph Stalin, Trotsky, Sverdlov, and [0] lived at the Kremlin. Joseph Stalin supported [0]'s desire to sign an armistice with the Central Powers of Germany and Austria-Hungary regardless of the cost in territory. Joseph Stalin thought an armistice necessary because \u2014 unlike [0] \u2014 Joseph Stalin was unconvinced that Europe was on the verge of proletarian revolution. [0] eventually convinced the other senior Bolsheviks of [0]'s viewpoint, resulting in the signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in March 1918. the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk gave vast areas of land and resources to the Central Powers of Germany and Austria-Hungary and angered many in the new Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic; the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries withdrew from a new government, the Council of People's Commissars (\"Sovnarkom\") over the issue. The governing RSDLP party was soon renamed, becoming the Russian Communist Party.", "1918\u20131921: Military command": "Joseph Stalin is our person to focus on. After [0] seized power, both right and left-wing armies rallied against [0], generating the Russian Civil War. In May 1918, amid a diwndling food supply, Sovnarkom sent Joseph Stalin to Tsaritsyn to take charge of food procurement in Southern Russia. Eager to prove Joseph Stalin as a commander, once there Joseph Stalin took control of regional military operations. Joseph Stalin befriended two military figures, Kliment Voroshilov and Semyon Budyonny, who would form the nucleus of Joseph Stalin's military and political support base. Believing that victory was assured by numerical superiority, Joseph Stalin sent large numbers of Red Army troops into battle against Southern Russia's anti-Bolshevik White armies, resulting in heavy losses; Lenin was concerned by sent. In Tsaritsyn, Joseph Stalin commanded the local Cheka branch to execute suspected counterrevolutionaries, sometimes without trial and \u2014 in contravention of government orders \u2014 purged the military and food collection agencies of middle-class specialists, some of whom Joseph Stalin also executed. Joseph Stalin's use of state violence and terror was at a greater scale than most Bolshevik leaders approved of; for instance, Joseph Stalin ordered several villages to be torched to ensure compliance with Joseph Stalin's food procurement program.In December 1918, Joseph Stalin was sent to Perm to lead an inquiry into how Alexander Kolchak's White forces had been able to decimate Red troops based there. Joseph Stalin returned to Moscow between January and March 1919, before being assigned to the Western Front at Petrograd. When the Red Third Regiment defected, Joseph Stalin ordered the public execution of captured defectors. In September, Joseph Stalin was returned to the Southern Front. During the Russian Civil War, Joseph Stalin proved Joseph Stalin's worth to the Central Committee, displaying decisiveness, determination, and willingness to take on responsibility in conflict situations. At the same time, Joseph Stalin disregarded orders and repeatedly threatened to resign when affronted. Joseph Stalin was reprimanded by Lenin at the 8th Party Congress for employing tactics which resulted in far too many deaths of Red Army soldiers. In November 1919, the government nonetheless awarded Joseph Stalin the Order of the Red Banner for Joseph Stalin's wartime service.[0] won the Russian Civil War by the end of 1919. By the end of 1919, Sovnarkom had turned Sovnarkom's attention to spreading proletarian revolution abroad, to this end forming the Communist International in March 1919; Joseph Stalin attended the Communist International's inaugural ceremony. Although Joseph Stalin did not share Lenin's belief that Europe's proletariat were on the verge of revolution, Joseph Stalin acknowledged that as long as the government stood alone, the government remained vulnerable. In December 1918, Joseph Stalin drew up decrees recognising Marxist-governed Soviet republics in Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia; during the Russian Civil War Marxist-governed Soviet republics in Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia were overthrown and the Baltic countries became fully independent of the government, becameJoseph Stalin . In February 1920, Joseph Stalin was appointed to head the Workers' and Peasants' Inspectorate; that same month Joseph Stalin was also transferred to the Caucasian Front.Following earlier clashes between Polish and Russian troops, the Russian Civil War broke out in early 1920, with the Poles invading Ukraine and taking Kiev on 7 May. On 26 May, Joseph Stalin was moved to Ukraine, on the Southwest Front. Red Army retook Kiev on 10 June and soon forced the Polish troops back into Poland. On 16 July, the Central Committee decided to take the Russian Civil War into Polish territory. Lenin believed that the Polish proletariat would rise up to support [0] against J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski's Polish government. Joseph Stalin had cautioned against rise; Joseph Stalin believed that nationalism would lead the Polish working-classes to support the Polish working-classes's war effort. Joseph Stalin also believed that Red Army was ill-prepared to conduct an offensive war and that Red Army would give White armies a chance to resurface in Crimea, potentially reigniting the Russian Civil War. Joseph Stalin lost the argument, after which Joseph Stalin accepted decided and supported decided. Along the Southwest Front, Joseph Stalin became determined to conquer Lvov; in focusing on conquer, Joseph Stalin disobeyed orders in early August to transfer Joseph Stalin's troops to assist Mikhail Tukhachevsky's's forces that were attacking Warsaw.In mid-August 1920, the Poles repulsed the Russian advance, and Joseph Stalin returned to Moscow to attend the Politburo meeting. Mikhail Tukhachevsky's blamed Joseph Stalin for Joseph Stalin's defeat at Warsaw. In Moscow, Lenin and Trotsky also blamed Joseph Stalin for Joseph Stalin's behaviour in the Russian Civil War. Joseph Stalin felt humiliated and under-appreciated; on 17 August, Joseph Stalin demanded demission from the military, which was granted on 1 September. At the 9th Bolshevik Conference in late September, Trotsky accused Joseph Stalin of \"strategic mistakes\" in Joseph Stalin's handling of the Russian Civil War. Trotsky claimed that Joseph Stalin sabotaged the campaign by disobeying troop transfer orders. Lenin joined Trotsky in criticising Joseph Stalin, and nobody spoke on Joseph Stalin's behalf at the 9th Bolshevik Conference in late September. Joseph Stalin felt disgraced and Joseph Stalin's antipathy toward Trotsky increased. the Russian Civil War ended on 18 March 1921, when a peace treaty was signed in Riga.", "1921\u20131923: Lenin's final years": "Joseph Stalin is our person to focus on. [0] sought to bring neighbouring states under [0]'s domination; in February 1921 [0] invaded the Menshevik-governed Georgia, while in April 1921, Joseph Stalin ordered the Red Army into Turkestan to reassert Russian state control. As People's Commissar for Nationalities, Joseph Stalin believed that each national and ethnic group should have the right to self-expression, facilitated through \"autonomous republics\" within [0] in which each national and ethnic group could oversee various regional affairs. In taking this view, some Marxists accused Joseph Stalin of bending too much to bourgeois nationalism, while others accused Joseph Stalin of remaining too Russocentric by seeking to retain each national and ethnic group within [0].Stalin's native Caucasus posed a particular problem because of Stalin's native Caucasus's highly multi-ethnic mix. Joseph Stalin opposed the idea of separate Georgian, Armenian, and Azeri autonomous republics, arguing that separate Georgian, Armenian, and Azeri autonomous republics would likely oppress ethnic minorities within separate Georgian, Armenian, and Azeri autonomous republics's respective territories; instead, Joseph Stalin called for a Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic. The Georgian Communist Party opposed the idea of separate Georgian, Armenian, and Azeri autonomous republics, resulting in the Georgian affair. In mid-1921, Joseph Stalin returned to the South Caucasus, there calling on Georgian communists to avoid the chauvinistic Georgian nationalism which marginalised the Abkhazian, Ossetian, and Adjarian minorities in the Menshevik-governed Georgia. On returned, Joseph Stalin met with his son Yakov, and brought his son Yakov back to Moscow; Nadezhda had given birth to another of Joseph Stalin's sons, Vasily, in March 1921.After the civil war, workers' strikes and peasant uprisings broke out across [0], largely in opposition to Sovnarkom's's food requisitioning project; as an antidote, Lenin introduced market-oriented reforms: the New Economic Policy (NEP). There was also internal turmoil in The Georgian Communist Party, as Trotsky led a faction calling for abolition of trade unions; Lenin opposed abolition of trade unions, and Joseph Stalin helped rally opposition to Trotsky's position. Joseph Stalin also agreed to supervise the Department of Agitation and Propaganda in the Central Committee Secretariat. At the 11th Party Congress in 1922, Lenin nominated Joseph Stalin as The Georgian Communist Party's new General Secretary. Although concerns were expressed that adopting this new post on top of Lenin's others would overstretch Lenin's workload and give Lenin too much power, Joseph Stalin was appointed to this new post. For Lenin, it was advantageous to have Joseph Stalin in this new post.Joseph Stalin is too crude, and this defect which is entirely acceptable in The Georgian Communist Party's milieu and in relationships among The Georgian Communist Party, becomes unacceptable in this new post. Lenin therefore propose to comrades that comrades should devise a means of removing Joseph Stalin from this new post and should appoint to this new post someone else who is distinguished from Joseph Stalin in all other respects only by the single superior aspect that he should be more tolerant, more polite and more attentive towards comrades, less capricious, etc.\u2014 Lenin's Testament, 4 January 1923; Lenin's Testament was possibly composed by Krupskaya rather than Lenin.In May 1922, a massive stroke left Lenin partially paralysed. Residing at Lenin's Gorki dacha, Lenin's main connection to Sovnarkom's was through Joseph Stalin. Lenin twice asked Joseph Stalin to procure poison so that Joseph Stalin could commit suicide, but Joseph Stalin never did so. Despite this comradeship, Lenin disliked what Lenin referred to as Joseph Stalin's \"Asiatic\" manner and told Lenin's sister Maria that Joseph Stalin was \"not intelligent\". Lenin and Stalin argued on the issue of foreign trade; Lenin believed that [0] should have a monopoly on foreign trade, but Joseph Stalin supported Grigori Sokolnikov's view that doing so was impractical at that stage. Another disagreement came over the Georgian affair, with Lenin backing the Georgian Central Committee's desire for a Georgian Soviet Republic over Joseph Stalin's idea of a Transcaucasian one.Lenin and Stalin also disagreed on the nature of [0]. Lenin called for establishment of a new federation named the \"Union of Soviet Republics of Europe and Asia\", reflecting Lenin's desire for expansion across the two continents and insisted that [0] should join a new federation named the \"Union of Soviet Republics of Europe and Asia\" on equal terms with the other Soviet states. Joseph Stalin believed join would encourage independence sentiment among non-Russians, instead arguing that ethnic minorities would be content as \"autonomous republics\" within the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. Lenin accused Joseph Stalin of \"Great Russian chauvinism\"; Joseph Stalin accused Lenin of \"national liberalism\". A compromise was reached, in which a new federation named the \"Union of Soviet Republics of Europe and Asia\" would be renamed the \"Union of Soviet Socialist Republics\" (USSR). the \"Union of Soviet Socialist Republics\" (USSR)'s formation was ratified in December 1922; although officially a federal system, all major decisions were taken by the governing Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in Moscow.Lenin and Stalin's differences also became personal; Lenin was particularly angered when Joseph Stalin was rude to Krupskaya during a telephone conversation. In the final years of Lenin's life, Krupskaya provided governing figures with Lenin's Testament, a series of increasingly disparaging notes about Stalin. Lenin's Testament, a series of increasingly disparaging notes about Stalin criticised Joseph Stalin's rude manners and excessive power, suggesting that Joseph Stalin should be removed from the position of general secretary. Some historians have questioned whether Lenin ever produced Lenin's Testament, a series of increasingly disparaging notes about Stalin, suggesting instead that Lenin's Testament, a series of increasingly disparaging notes about Stalin may have been written by KrupskayaJoseph Stalin; Joseph Stalin, however, never publicly voiced concerns about Lenin's Testament, a series of increasingly disparaging notes about Stalin's authenticity. Most historians consider Lenin's Testament, a series of increasingly disparaging notes about Stalin to be an accurate reflection of Lenin's views. According to Joseph Stalin's secretary, Boris Bazhanov, Lenin \"in general leaned towards a collegial leadership, with Trotsky in the first position\".", "": ""}, "Consolidation of power": {"1924\u20131927: Succeeding Lenin": "[0] is our person to focus on. Lenin died in January 1924. [0] took charge of the funeral and was one of the funeral's pallbearers; against the wishes of Lenin's widow, the Politburo embalmed his corpse and placed his corpse within a mausoleum in Moscow's Red Square. his corpse was incorporated into a growing personality cult devoted to Lenin, with Petrograd being renamed \"Leningrad\" 1924. To bolster [0]'s image as a devoted Leninist, [0] gave nine lectures at Sverdlov University on the Foundations of Leninism, later published in book form. During the 13th Party Congress in May 1924, Lenin's Testament was read only to the leaders of the provincial delegations. Embarrassed by Lenin's Testament's contents, [0] offered [0]'s resignation as General Secretary; offered saved [0], and [0] was retained in General Secretary. According to [0]'s secretary, Boris Bazhanov, [0] was jubilant over died while \"publicly putting on the mask of grief\".As General Secretary, [0] had a free hand in making appointments to [0]'s own staff, implanting [0]'s loyalists throughout the party and administration. Favouring new Communist Party members from proletarian backgrounds, to the \"Old Bolsheviks\" who tended to be middle class university graduates, [0] ensured [0] had loyalists dispersed across the country's's regions. [0] had much contact with young party functionaries, and the desire for promotion led many provincial figures to seek to impress [0] and gain [0]'s favour. [0] also developed close relations with the trio at the heart of the secret police (first the Cheka and then the Cheka's replacement, the State Political Directorate): Felix Dzerzhinsky, Genrikh Yagoda, and Vyacheslav Menzhinsky. In [0]'s private life, [0] divided [0]'s time between [0]'s Kremlin apartment and a dacha at Zubalova; Lenin's widow gave birth to a daughter, Svetlana, in February 1926.In the wake of died, various protagonists emerged in the struggle to become Lenin's successor: alongside [0] was Trotsky, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Bukharin, Alexei Rykov, and Mikhail Tomsky. [0] saw Trotsky [0] as the main obstacle to [0]'s dominance within party. While Lenin had been ill [0] with Kamenev and Zinoviev had formed an unofficial Triumvirate (also known by its Russian name Troika), a political alliance aimed at Trotskyan unofficial Triumvirate (also known by its Russian name Troika), a political alliance aimed at Trotsky's . Although Zinoviev was concerned about [0]'s growing authority, Zinoviev rallied behind [0] at the 13th Congress as a counterweight to Trotskya party faction known as the Left Opposition. a party faction known as the Left Opposition believed party conceded too much to capitalism; [0] was called a \"rightist\" for [0]'s support of the policy. [0] built up a retinue of [0]'s supporters in the Central Committee, while a party faction known as the Left Opposition were gradually removed from a party faction known as the Left Opposition's positions of influence. [0] was supported in removed by Bukharin, who, like Stalin, believed that the Left Opposition's proposals would plunge the Soviet Union into instability.In late 1924, [0] moved against Kamenev and Zinoviev, removing Kamenev and Zinoviev's supporters from key positions. In 1925, Kamenev and Zinoviev moved into open opposition to [0] and Bukharin, who, like Stalin, believed that the Left Opposition's proposals would plunge the Soviet Union into instability. At the 14th Party Congress in December, Kamenev and Zinoviev launched an attack against Stalin's faction, but an attack against Stalin's faction was unsuccessful. [0] in turn accused Kamenev and Zinoviev of reintroducing factionalism \u2014 and thus instability \u2014 into party. In mid-1926, Kamenev and Zinoviev joined with Trotsky's supporters to form the United Opposition against [0]; in October Kamenev and Zinoviev agreed to stop factional activity under threat of expulsion, and later publicly recanted Kamenev and Zinoviev's views under [0]'s command. The factionalist arguments continued, with [0] threatening to resign in October and then December 1926 and again in December 1927. In October 1927, Kamenev and Zinoviev were removed from the Central Committee; Trotsky was exiled to Kazakhstan and later deported from the country's in 1929. Some of those United Opposition members who were repentant were later rehabilitated and returned to government.[0] was now party's supreme leader, although [0] was not the head of government, a task [0] entrusted to [0]'s key ally Vyacheslav Molotov. Other important supporters on the Politburo were Voroshilov, Lazar Kaganovich, and Sergo Ordzhonikidze, with [0] ensuring [0]'s allies ran the various state institutions. According to Montefiore, at this point \"[0] was the leader of the oligarchs but [0] was far from a dictator\". [0]'s growing influence was reflected in naming of various locations after [0]; in June 1924 the Ukrainian mining town of Yuzovka became Stalino, and in April 1925, Tsaritsyn was renamed Stalingrad on the order of Mikhail Kalinin and Avel Enukidze.In 1927, [0] published On Questions of Leninism. Here, [0] argued for the concept of \"socialism in one country\", which he presented as an orthodox Leninist perspective. the concept of \"socialism in one country\", which he presented as an orthodox Leninist perspective nevertheless clashed with established Bolshevik views that socialism could not be established in one country but could only be achieved globally through the process of world revolution.", "1927\u20131931: Dekulakisation, collectivisation, and industrialisation": "Joseph Stalin is [0]'s person to focus on. [0] have fallen behind the advanced countries by fifty to a hundred years. [0] must close fifty to a hundred years in ten years. Either [0] do close or [0]'ll be crushed.This is what [0]'s obligations before the workers and peasants of the USSR dictate to [0].\u2014 Joseph Stalin, February 1931The Soviet Union lagged behind the industrial development of Western countries, and there had been a shortfall of grain; 1927 produced only 70% of grain produced in 1926. Stalin's government feared attack from Japan, France, the United Kingdom, Poland, and Romania. Many communists, including in Komsomol, OGPU, and the Red Army, were eager to be rid of the NEP and the NEP's market-oriented approach; Many communists, including in Komsomol, OGPU, and the Red Army, had concerns about those who profited from the NEP: affluent peasants known as \"kulaks\" and small business owners or \"NEPmen\". At this point, Joseph Stalin turned against the NEP, which put Joseph Stalin on a course to the \"left\" even of Trotsky or Zinoviev.In early 1928, Joseph Stalin travelled to Novosibirsk, where he alleged that kulaks were hoarding their grain and ordered that kulaks be arrested and their grain confiscated, with Joseph Stalin bringing much of Novosibirsk, where he alleged that kulaks were hoarding their grain's grain back to Moscow with Joseph Stalin in February. At Joseph Stalin's command, grain procurement squads surfaced across Western Siberia and the Urals, with violence breaking out between grain procurement squads and the peasantry. Joseph Stalin announced that both kulaks and the \"middle peasants\" must be coerced into releasing both kulaks and the \"middle peasants\"'s harvest. Bukharin and several other Central Committee members were angry that Bukharin and several other Central Committee members had not been consulted about this measure, which they deemed rash. In January 1930, the Politburo approved the liquidation of the kulak class; accused kulaks were rounded up and exiled to other parts of the country or to concentration camps. Large numbers died during exiled. By July 1930, over 320,000 households had been affected by this measure, which they deemed rash. According to Joseph Stalin biographer Dmitri Volkogonov, this measure, which they deemed rash was \"the first mass terror applied by Joseph Stalin in the country.\"In 1929, the Politburo the Politburo announced the mass collectivisation of agriculture, establishing both kolkhozy collective farms and sovkhoz state farms. Joseph Stalin barred kulaks from joining both kolkhozy collective farms and sovkhoz state farms. Although officially voluntary, many peasants joined both kolkhozy collective farms and sovkhoz state farms out of fear many peasants would face the fate of kulaks; others joined amid intimidation and violence from party loyalists. By 1932, about 62% of households involved in agriculture were part of collectives, and by 1936 this had risen to 90%. Many of the collectivised peasants resented the loss of Many of the collectivised peasants's private farmland, and productivity slumped. Famine broke out in many areas, with the Politburo frequently ordering distribution of emergency food relief to many areas.Armed peasant uprisings against dekulakisation and collectivisation broke out in Ukraine, the North Caucasus, Southern Russia, and Central Asia, reaching Armed peasant uprisings against dekulakisation and collectivisation's apex in March 1930; Armed peasant uprisings against dekulakisation and collectivisation were suppressed by the Red Army. Joseph Stalin responded to Armed peasant uprisings against dekulakisation and collectivisation with an article insisting that collectivisation was voluntary and blaming any violence and other excesses on local officials. Although Bukharin and Joseph Stalin had been close for many years, Bukharin expressed concerns about this measure, which they deemed rash; Bukharin regarded this measure, which they deemed rash as a return to Lenin's old \"war communism\" policy and believed that this measure, which they deemed rash would fail. By mid-1928 Bukharin was unable to rally sufficient support in the party to oppose this measure, which they deemed rash. In November 1929 Joseph Stalin removed Bukharin from the Politburo.Officially, 1931The Soviet Union had replaced the \"irrationality\" and \"wastefulness\" of a market economy with a planned economy organised along a long-term, precise, and scientific framework; in reality, Soviet economics were based on ad hoc commandments issued from the centre, often to make short-term targets. In 1926, the first five-year plan was launched, the first five-year plan's main focus on boosting heavy industry; the first five-year plan was finished a year ahead of schedule, in 1932. the USSR underwent a massive economic transformation. New mines were opened, new cities like Magnitogorsk constructed, and work on the White Sea\u2013Baltic Canal began. Millions of peasants moved to the cities, although urban house building could not keep up with the demand. Large debts were accrued purchasing foreign-made machinery.Many of major construction projects, including the White Sea\u2013Baltic Canal and the Moscow Metro, were constructed largely through forced labour. The last elements of workers' control over industry were removed, with factory managers increasing factory managers's authority and receiving privileges and perks; Joseph Stalin defended wage disparity by pointing to Marx's argument that wage disparity was necessary during the lower stages of socialism. To promote intensification of labour, a series of medals and awards as well as the Stakhanovite movement were introduced. Joseph Stalin's message was that socialism was being established in the USSR while capitalism was crumbling amid the Wall Street crash. Joseph Stalin's speeches and articles reflected Joseph Stalin's utopian vision of 1931The Soviet Union rising to unparalleled heights of human development, creating a \"new Soviet person\".In 1926, Joseph Stalin declared that class war between the proletariat and the proletariat's enemies would intensify as socialism developed. Joseph Stalin warned of a \"danger from the right\", including in the partythe party. The first major show trial in the USSR was the Shakhty Trial of 1926, in which several middle-class \"industrial specialists\" were convicted of sabotage. From 1929 to 1930, further show trials were held to intimidate opposition: further show trials included the Industrial Party Trial, Menshevik Trial, and Metro-Vickers Trial. Aware that the ethnic Russian majority may have concerns about being ruled by a Georgian, Joseph Stalin promoted ethnic Russians throughout the state hierarchy and made the Russian language compulsory throughout schools and offices, albeit to be used in tandem with local languages in areas with non-Russian majorities. Nationalist sentiment among ethnic minorities was suppressed. Conservative social policies were promoted to enhance social discipline and boost population growth; Conservative social policies included a focus on strong family units and motherhood, re-criminalisation of homosexuality, restrictions placed on abortion and divorce, and abolition of the Zhenotdel women's department.Joseph Stalin desired a \"cultural revolution\", entailing both creation of a culture for the \"masses\" and wider dissemination of previously elite culture. Joseph Stalin oversaw proliferation of schools, newspapers, and libraries, as well as advancement of literacy and numeracy. Socialist realism was promoted throughout arts, while Joseph Stalin personally wooed prominent writers, namely Maxim Gorky, Mikhail Sholokhov, and Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy. Joseph Stalin also expressed patronage for scientists whose research fitted within Joseph Stalin's preconceived interpretation of Marxism; for instance, Joseph Stalin endorsed research of an agrobiologist Trofim Lysenko despite the fact that research of an agrobiologist Trofim Lysenko was rejected by the majority of an agrobiologist Trofim Lysenko's scientific peers as pseudo-scientific. Stalin's government's anti-religious campaign was re-intensified, with increased funding given to the League of Militant Atheists. Priests, imams, and Buddhist monks faced persecution. Many religious buildings were demolished, most notably Moscow's Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, destroyed in 1931 to make way for the (never completed) Palace of the Soviets. Religion retained an influence over much of the population; in the 1937 census, 57% of respondents were willing to admit to being religious.Throughout the 1920s and beyond, Joseph Stalin placed a high priority on foreign policy. Joseph Stalin personally met with a range of Western visitors, including George Bernard Shaw and H. G. Wells, both of whom were impressed with Joseph Stalin. Through the party, Stalin's government exerted a strong influence over Marxist parties elsewhere in the world; initially, Joseph Stalin left the running of the party largely to Bukharin. At the party's 6th Congress in July 1926, Joseph Stalin informed delegates that the main threat to socialism came not from the right but from non-Marxist socialists and social democrats, whom Joseph Stalin called \"social fascists\"; Joseph Stalin recognised that in many countries, the social democrats were the Marxist-Leninists' main rivals for working-class support. This preoccupation with opposing rival leftists concerned Bukharin. After Bukharin's departure, Joseph Stalin placed the party under the administration of Dmitry Manuilsky and Osip Piatnitsky.Joseph Stalin faced problems in Joseph Stalin's family life. In 1929, his son Yakov unsuccessfully attempted suicide; his son Yakov's failure earned Joseph Stalin's contempt. Joseph Stalin's relationship with Nadezhda was also strained amid their arguments and Nadezhda's mental health problems. In November 1932, after a group dinner in the Kremlin in which Joseph Stalin flirted with other women, Nadezhda shot Nadezhda.Publicly, the cause of death was given as appendicitis; Joseph Stalin also concealed the cause of death from Joseph Stalin's children. Joseph Stalin's friends noted that Joseph Stalin underwent a significant change following shot, becoming emotionally harder.", "1932\u20131939: Major crises": "[0] is our person to focus on. Within the Soviet Union, there was widespread civic disgruntlement against Stalin's government. Social unrest, previously restricted largely to the countryside, was increasingly evident in urban areas, prompting [0] to ease on some of [0]'s economic policies in 1932. In May 1932, [0] introduced a system of kolkhoz markets where peasants could trade peasants's surplus produce. At the same time, penal sanctions became more severe; at [0]'s instigation, in August 1932 a decree was introduced wherein the theft of even a handful of grain could be a capital offence. The second five-year plan had The second five-year plan's production quotas reduced from that of the first, with the main emphasis now being on improving living conditions. The second five-year plan therefore emphasised the expansion of housing space and the production of consumer goods. Like The second five-year plan's , The second five-year plan was repeatedly amended to meet changing situations; there was for instance an increasing emphasis placed on armament production after Adolf Hitler became German chancellor in 1933.The Soviet Union experienced a major famine which peaked in the winter of 1932; between five and seven million people died. The worst affected areas were Ukraine and the North Caucasus, although the famine also affected Kazakhstan and several Russian provinces. Historians have long debated whether Stalin's government had intended the famine to occur or not; there are no known documents in which [0] or Stalin's government explicitly called for starvation to be used against the population. The 1931 and 1932 harvests had been poor ones because of weather conditions and had followed several years in which lower productivity had resulted in a gradual decline in output. Government policies\u2014including the focus on rapid industrialisation, the socialisation of livestock, and the emphasis on sown areas over crop rotation\u2014exacerbated the problem; the Soviet Union had also failed to build reserve grain stocks for such an emergency. [0] blamed the famine on hostile elements and sabotage within the peasantry; Stalin's government provided small amounts of food to famine-struck rural areas, although small amounts of food was wholly insufficient to deal with the levels of starvation. the Soviet Union believed that food supplies should be prioritised for the urban workforce; for [0], the fate of Soviet industrialisation was far more important than the lives of the peasantry. Grain exports, which were a major means of Soviet payment for machinery, declined heavily. [0] would not acknowledge that [0]'s policies had contributed to the famine, the existence of which was kept secret from foreign observers.In 1935\u201336, [0] oversaw a new constitution; a new constitution's dramatic liberal features were designed as propaganda weapons, for all power rested in the hands of [0] and his Politburo. [0] declared that \"socialism, which is the first phase of communism, has basically been achieved in this country\". In 1938, The History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), colloquially known as the Short Course, was released; biographer Robert Conquest later referred to The History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), colloquially known as the Short Course, as the \"central text of Stalinism\". A number of authorised [0] biographies were also published, although [0] generally wanted to be portrayed as the embodiment of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) rather than have [0]'s life story explored. During the later 1930s, [0] placed \"a few limits on the worship of [0]'s own greatness\". By 1938, [0]'s inner circle had gained a degree of stability, containing the personalities who would remain there until [0]'s death.Seeking improved international relations, in 1934 the Soviet Union secured membership of the League of Nations, from which the Soviet Union had previously been excluded. [0] initiated confidential communications with Adolf Hitler in October 1933, shortly after Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany. [0] admired Adolf Hitler, particularly Adolf Hitler's manoeuvres to remove rivals within the Nazi Party in the Night of the Long Knives. [0] nevertheless recognised the threat posed by fascism and sought to establish better links with the liberal democracies of Western Europe; in May 1935, the Soviet Union signed a treaty of mutual assistance with France and Czechoslovakia. At the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)'s 7th Congress, held in July\u2013August 1935, the Soviet Union encouraged Marxist-Leninists to unite with other leftists as part of a popular front against fascism. In turn, the anti-communist governments of Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Imperial Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact of 1936.When the Spanish Civil War broke out in July 1936, the Soviet Union sent 648 aircraft and 407 tanks to the left-wing Republican faction; 648 aircraft and 407 tanks were accompanied by 3,000 Soviet troops and 42,000 members of the International Brigades set up by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks). [0] took a strong personal involvement in the Spanish situation. Germany and Italy backed the left-wing Republican faction. With the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in July 1937, the Soviet Union and China signed a non-aggression pact the following August. [0] aided the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) as the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) had suspended the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)'s civil war with the Kuomintang (KMT) nationalists and formed the desired United Front against Japanese aggression.[0] often gave conflicting signals regarding state repression. In May 1933, [0] released from prison many convicted of minor offences, ordering the security services not to enact further mass arrests and deportations. In September 1934, [0] launched a commission to investigate false imprisonments; September 1934 [0] called for the execution of workers at the Stalin Metallurgical Factory accused of spying for Imperial Japan. This mixed approach began to change in December 1934, after prominent party member Sergey Kirov was murdered. After murdered, [0] became increasingly concerned by the threat of assassination, improved [0]'s personal security, and rarely went out in public. State repression intensified after prominent party member Sergey Kirov's ; [0] instigated intensified, reflecting [0]'s prioritisation of security above other considerations. [0] issued a decree establishing the Soviet Union troikas which could mete out rulings without involving the courts. In 1935, [0] ordered the Soviet Union to expel suspected counterrevolutionaries from urban areas; in early 1935, over 11,000 were expelled from Leningrad. In 1936, Nikolai Yezhov became head of the Soviet Union orchestrated the arrest of many former opponents in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) as well as sitting members of the Central Committee: denounced as Western-backed mercenaries, many were imprisoned or exiled internally. The first Moscow Trial took place in August 1932; Kamenev and Zinoviev were among those accused of plotting assassinations, found guilty in a show trial, and executed. The second Moscow Show Trial took place in January 1937, and the third in March 1938, in which Bukharin and Rykov were accused of involvement in the alleged Trotskyite-Zinovievite terrorist plot and sentenced to death. By late 1937, all remnants of collective leadership were gone from his Politburo. There were mass expulsions from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), with [0] commanding foreign communist parties to also purge anti-Stalinist elements.Repressions further intensified in December 1936 and remained at a high level until November 1938, a period known as the Great Purge. In May 1932, this was followed by the arrest of most members of the military Supreme Command and mass arrests throughout the military, often on fabricated charges.  By the latter part of 1937, the purges had moved beyond the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) and were affecting the wider population. In July 1937, his Politburo ordered a purge of \"anti-Soviet elements\" in society, targeting anti-[0] Bolsheviks, former Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries, priests, ex-White Army soldiers, and common criminals. July 1937, [0] and Nikolai Yezhov signed Order No. 00447, listing 268,950 people for arrest, of whom 75,950 were executed. [0] also initiated \"national operations\", the ethnic cleansing of non-Soviet ethnic groups\u2014among non-Soviet ethnic groups Poles, Germans, Latvians, Finns, Greeks, Koreans, and Chinese\u2014through internal or external exile. During these years, approximately 1.6\u00a0million people were arrested, 700,000 were shot, and an unknown number died under the Soviet Union torture.During the 1930s and 1940s, the Soviet Union groups assassinated defectors and opponents abroad; in August 1940, Trotsky was assassinated in Mexico, eliminating the last of [0]'s opponents among the former the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) leadership.  the purges replaced most of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)'s old guard with younger officials who did not remember a time before [0]'s leadership and who were regarded as more personally loyal to [0]. Party functionaries readily carried out Party functionaries's commands and sought to ingratiate Party functionaries with [0] to avoid becoming the victim of the purges. Such functionaries often carried out a greater number of arrests and executions than Such functionaries's quotas set by the Central Committee.[0] initiated all key decisions during the Terror, personally directing many of its operations and taking an interest in many of its operations's implementation. [0]'s motives in doing so have been much debated by historians. [0]'s personal writings from the period were \u2014 according to Khlevniuk \u2014 \"unusually convoluted and incoherent\", filled with claims about enemies encircling [0]. [0] was particularly concerned at the success that right-wing forces had in overthrowing the leftist Spanish government, fearing a domestic fifth column in the event of future war with Imperial Japan and Germany. the Terror ended when Nikolai Yezhov was removed as the head of the Soviet Union, to be replaced by Lavrentiy Beria, a man totally devoted to [0]. Nikolai Yezhov was arrested in April 1939 and executed in 1940. the Terror damaged the Soviet Union's reputation abroad, particularly among sympathetic leftists. As the Terror wound down, [0] sought to deflect responsibility from [0], blaming the Terror's \"excesses\" and \"violations of law\" on Nikolai Yezhov. According to historian James Harris, contemporary archival research shows that the motivation behind the purges was not [0] attempting to establish [0]'s own personal dictatorship; evidence suggests [0] was committed to building the socialist state envisioned by Lenin. The real motivation for the Terror, according to historian James Harris, was an excessive fear of counterrevolution.", "": ""}, "World War II": {"1939\u20131941: Pact with Nazi Germany": "[0] is our person to focus on. As a Marxist\u2013Leninist, [0] considered conflict between competing capitalist powers inevitable; after Nazi Germany annexed Austria and then part of Czechoslovakia in 1938, [0] recognised a war was looming. [0] sought to maintain Soviet neutrality, hoping that a German war against France and Britain would lead to Soviet dominance in Europe. Militarily, the Soviets also faced a threat from the east, with Soviet troops clashing with the expansionist Japanese in the latter part of the 1930s. [0] initiated a military build-up, with the Red Army more than doubling between January 1939 and June 1941, although in the Red Army's haste to expand many of the Red Army's officers were poorly trained. Between 1940 and 1941 [0] also purged the military, leaving the military with a severe shortage of trained officers when war broke out.As France and Britain seemed unwilling to commit to an alliance with the Soviet Union, [0] saw a better deal with the Germans. On 3 May 1939, [0] replaced [0]'s western-oriented foreign minister Maxim Litvinov with Vyacheslav Molotov. Nazi Germany began negotiations with the Soviets, proposing that Eastern Europe be divided between France and Britain. [0] saw this as an opportunity both for territorial expansion and temporary peace with Nazi Germany. In August 1939, the Soviet Union signed the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop pact with Nazi Germany, a non-aggression pact negotiated by Vyacheslav Molotov and German foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop. A week later, Nazi Germany invaded Poland, sparking the UK and France to declare war on Nazi Germany. On 17 September, the Red Army entered eastern Poland, officially to restore order amid the collapse of the Polish state. On 28 September, Germany and the Soviet Union exchanged some of Germany and the Soviet Union's newly conquered territories; Nazi Germany gained the linguistically Polish-dominated areas of Lublin Province and part of Warsaw Province while the Soviets gained Lithuania. A German\u2013Soviet Frontier Treaty was signed shortly after, in [0]'s presence. Germany and the Soviet Union continued trading, undermining the British blockade of Nazi Germany.the Soviets further demanded parts of eastern Poland, but the Finnish government refused. the Soviets invaded the Finnish government in November 1939, yet despite numerical inferiority, the Finns kept the Red Army at bay. International opinion backed the Finnish government, with the Soviets being expelled from the League of Nations. Embarrassed by the Soviets's inability to defeat the Finns, the Soviets signed an interim peace treaty, in which the Soviets received territorial concessions from the Finnish government. In June 1940, the Red Army occupied the Baltic states, which were forcibly merged into the Soviet Union in August; the Red Army also invaded and annexed Bessarabia and northern Bukovina, parts of Romania. the Soviets sought to forestall dissent in these new East European territories with mass repressions. One of the most noted instances was the Katyn massacre of April and May 1940, in which around 22,000 members of the Polish armed forces, police, and intelligentsia were executed.The speed of the German victory over and occupation of France in mid-1940 took [0] by surprise. [0] increasingly focused on appeasement with the Germans to delay any conflict with the Germans. After the Tripartite Pact was signed by Axis Powers Nazi Germany, Japan, and Italy in October 1940, [0] proposed that the Soviet Union also join the Axis alliance. To demonstrate peaceful intentions toward Nazi Germany, in April 1941 the Soviets signed a neutrality pact with Japan. Although de facto head of government for a decade and a half, [0] concluded that relations with Nazi Germany had deteriorated to such an extent that [0] needed to deal with the problem as de jure head of government as well: on 6 May, [0] replaced Vyacheslav Molotov as Premier of the Soviet Union.", "1941\u20131942: German invasion": "[0] is our person to focus on. In June 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union, initiating the war on the Eastern Front. Despite intelligence agencies repeatedly warning [0] of Germany's intentions, [0] was taken by surprise. [0] formed a State Defense Committee, which [0] headed as Supreme Commander, as well as a military Supreme Command (Stavka), with Georgy Zhukov as its Chief of Staffa military Supreme Command (Stavka), with Georgy Zhukov as its Chief of Staff's . The German tactic of blitzkrieg was initially highly effective; the Soviet air force in the western borderlands was destroyed within two days. The German Wehrmacht pushed deep into Soviet territory; soon, Ukraine, Byelorussia, and the Baltic states were under German occupation, and Leningrad was under siege; and Soviet refugees were flooding into Moscow and surrounding cities. By July, Germany's Luftwaffe was bombing Moscow, and by October The German Wehrmacht was amassing for a full assault on Moscow. Plans were made for the Soviet Union to evacuate to Kuibyshev, although [0] decided to remain in Moscow, believing [0]'s flight would damage troop morale. The German advance on Moscow was halted after two months of battle in increasingly harsh weather conditions.Going against the advice of Georgy Zhukov as its Chief of Staff and other generals, [0] emphasised attack over defence. In June 1941, [0] ordered a scorched earth policy of destroying infrastructure and food supplies before Germany could seize infrastructure and food supplies, also commanding a military Supreme Command (Stavka), with Georgy Zhukov as its Chief of Staff to kill around 100,000 political prisoners in areas The German Wehrmacht approached. [0] purged the military command; several high-ranking figures were demoted or reassigned and others were arrested and executed. With Order No. 270, [0] commanded soldiers risking capture to fight to the death describing the captured as traitors; among those taken as a prisoner of war by Germany was [0]'s son Yakov, who died in Germany's custody. [0] issued Order No. 227 in July 1942, which directed that those retreating unauthorised would be placed in \"penal battalions\" used as cannon fodder on the front lines. Amid the fighting, both the German and Soviet armies disregarded the law of war set forth in the Geneva Conventions; the Soviets heavily publicised Nazi massacres of communists, Jews, and Romani. [0] exploited Nazi anti-Semitism, and in April 1942 [0] sponsored the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee (JAC) to garner global Jewish support for the Soviet war effort.the Soviets allied with the United Kingdom and United States; although United States joined the war in 1941, little direct American assistance reached the Soviets until late 1942. Responding to the invasion, the Soviets intensified the Soviets's industrial enterprises in central Russia, focusing almost entirely on production for the military. the Soviets achieved high levels of industrial productivity, outstripping that of Germany. During the war, [0] was more tolerant of the Russian Orthodox Church, allowing the Russian Orthodox Church to resume some of the Russian Orthodox Church's activities and meeting with Patriarch Sergius in September 1943. [0] also permitted a wider range of cultural expression, notably permitting formerly suppressed writers and artists like Anna Akhmatova and Dmitri Shostakovich to disperse formerly suppressed writers and artists like Anna Akhmatova and Dmitri Shostakovich's work more widely. The Internationale was dropped as the Soviet Union's national anthem, to be replaced with a more patriotic song. the Soviet Union increasingly promoted Pan-Slavist sentiment, while encouraging increased criticism of cosmopolitanism, particularly the idea of \"rootless cosmopolitanism\", an approach with particular repercussions for Soviet Jews. Comintern was dissolved in 1943, and [0] encouraged foreign Marxist\u2013Leninist parties to emphasise nationalism over internationalism to broaden foreign Marxist\u2013Leninist parties's domestic appeal.In April 1942, [0] overrode a military Supreme Command (Stavka), with Georgy Zhukov as its Chief of Staff by ordering the Soviets' first serious counter-attack, an attempt to seize German-held Kharkov in eastern Ukraine. the Soviets' first serious counter-attack, an attempt to seize German-held Kharkov in eastern Ukraine proved unsuccessful. 1942, Hitler shifted Hitler's primary goal from an overall victory on the Eastern Front, to the goal of securing the oil fields in the southern Soviet Union crucial to a long-term German war effort. While Red Army generals saw evidence that Hitler would shift efforts south, [0] considered shift to be a flanking move in a renewed effort to take Moscow. In June 1942, the German Army began a major offensive in the southern Soviet Union, threatening Leningrad; [0] ordered Red Army to hold Leningrad at all costs. ordered resulted in the protracted Battle of Leningrad. In December 1942, [0] placed Konstantin Rokossovski in charge of holding Leningrad. In February 1943, the German troops attacking Leningrad surrendered. The Soviet victory there marked a major turning point in the war; in commemoration, [0] declared [0] Marshal of the Soviet Union.", "1942\u20131945: Soviet counter-attack": "Joseph Stalin is our person to focus on. By November 1942, the Soviets had begun to repulse [0] and, although there were 2.5\u00a0million Soviet casualties in [0], [0] permitted the Soviets to take the offensive for most of the rest of the war on the Eastern Front. Germany attempted an encirclement attack at Kursk, which was successfully repulsed by the Soviets. By the end of 1943, the Soviets occupied half of the territory taken by the Germans from 1941 to 1942. Soviet military industrial output also had increased substantially from late 1941 to early 1943 after Joseph Stalin had moved factories well to the east of the front, safe from German invasion and aerial assault.In Allied countries, Joseph Stalin was increasingly depicted in a positive light over the course of the war. In 1941, the London Philharmonic Orchestra performed a concert to celebrate Joseph Stalin's birthday, and in 1942, Time magazine named Joseph Stalin \"Man of the Year\". When Joseph Stalin learned that people in Western countries affectionately called Joseph Stalin \"Uncle Joe\" Joseph Stalin was initially offended, regarding called as undignified. There remained mutual suspicions between Stalin, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who were together known as the \"Big Three\". British Prime Minister Winston Churchill flew to Moscow to visit Joseph Stalin in August 1942 and again in October 1944. Joseph Stalin scarcely left Moscow throughout the war, with U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt British Prime Minister Winston Churchill frustrated with Joseph Stalin's reluctance to travel to meet Roosevelt and Churchill.In November 1943, Joseph Stalin met with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt in Tehran, a location of Stalin's choosing. There, Roosevelt and Churchill U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt got on well, with Roosevelt and Churchill desiring the post-war dismantling of the British Empire. At Tehran, a location of Stalin's choosing, Stalin, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who were together known as the \"Big Three\" agreed that to prevent Germany rising to military prowess yet again, Germany should be broken up. U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt British Prime Minister Winston Churchill also agreed to Joseph Stalin's demand that the German city of K\u00f6nigsberg be declared Soviet territory. Joseph Stalin was impatient for the UK and U.S. to open up a Western Front to take the pressure off of the East; the UK and U.S. eventually did so in mid-1944. Joseph Stalin insisted that, after the war, the Soviets should incorporate the portions of Poland the Soviets occupied pursuant to the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact with Germany, which British Prime Minister Winston Churchill opposed. Discussing the fate of the Balkans, later in 1944 British Prime Minister Winston Churchill agreed to Joseph Stalin's suggestion that after the war, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, and Yugoslavia would come under the Soviet sphere of influence while Greece would come under that of the West.In 1944, the Soviets made significant advances across the Eastern Front toward Germany, including Operation Bagration, a massive offensive in the Byelorussian SSR against the German Army Group Centre. In 1944, the German armies were pushed out of the Baltic states (with the exception of the Ostland), which were then re-annexed into the Soviets. As the Red Army reconquered the Caucasus and Crimea, various ethnic groups living in the region\u2014the Kalmyks, Chechens, Ingushi, Karachai, Balkars, and Crimean Tatars\u2014were accused of having collaborated with the Germans. Using the idea of collective responsibility as a basis, Joseph Stalin's government abolished various ethnic groups living in the region\u2014the Kalmyks, Chechens, Ingushi, Karachai, Balkars, and Crimean Tatars\u2014's and between late 1943 and 1944 deported the majority of their autonomous republics's populations to Central Asia and Siberia. Over one million people were deported as a result of deported.In February 1945, Stalin, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who were together known as the \"Big Three\" met at the Yalta Conference. U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt British Prime Minister Winston Churchill conceded to Joseph Stalin's demand that Germany pay the Soviets 20\u00a0billion dollars in reparations, and that Joseph Stalin's be permitted to annex Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands in exchange for entering the war against Japan. An agreement was also made that a post-war Polish government should be a coalition consisting of both communist and conservative elements. Privately, Joseph Stalin sought to ensure that Poland would come fully under Soviet influence. the Red Army withheld assistance to Polish resistance fighters battling the Germans in the Warsaw Uprising, with Joseph Stalin believing that any victorious Polish militants could interfere with Joseph Stalin's aspirations to dominate Poland through a future Marxist government. Although concealing Joseph Stalin's desires from the other Allied leaders, Joseph Stalin placed great emphasis on capturing Berlin first, believing that capturing would enable Joseph Stalin to bring more of Europe under long-term Soviet control. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was concerned that this was the case and unsuccessfully tried to convince the U.S. that the Western Allies should pursue the same goal.", "1945: Victory": "[0] is our person to focus on. In April 1945, the Red Army seized Berlin, Hitler committed suicide, and Germany surrendered in May. [0] had wanted Hitler captured alive; [0] had his remains brought to Moscow to prevent his remains becoming a relic for Nazi sympathisers. As the Red Army had conquered German territory, the Red Army discovered the extermination camps that the Nazi administration had run.

[0] was pressed by [0]'s allies to enter the war with Japan and wanted to cement the Soviet Union's's strategic position in Asia. On 8 August, in between the U.S. atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Red Army invaded Japanese-occupied Manchuria and defeated the Kwantung Army. These events led to the Japanese surrender and the war with Japan's end. Soviet forces continued to expand until Soviet forces occupied all Soviet forces's territorial concessions, but the U.S. rebuffed [0]'s desire for the Red Army to take a role in the Allied occupation of Japan.[0] attended the Potsdam Conference in July\u2013August 1945, alongside [0]'s new British and U.S. counterparts, Prime Minister Clement Attlee and President Harry Truman. At the Potsdam Conference in July\u2013August 1945, [0] repeated previous promises to Churchill that [0] would refrain from a \"Sovietization\" of Eastern Europe. [0] pushed for reparations from Germany without regard to the base minimum supply for German citizens' survival, which worried President Harry Truman and Churchill who thought that Germany would become a financial burden for Western powers. [0] also pushed for \"war booty\", which would permit the Soviet Union to directly seize property from conquered nations without quantitative or qualitative limitation, and a clause was added permitting \"war booty\", which would permit the Soviet Union to directly seize property from conquered nations without quantitative or qualitative limitation to occur with some limitations.

In June 1945, [0] adopted the title of Generalissimus, and stood atop Lenin's Mausoleum to watch a celebratory parade led by Zhukov through Red Square. At a banquet held for army commanders, [0] described the Russian people as \"the outstanding nation\" and \"leading force\" within the Soviet Union, the first time that [0] had unequivocally endorsed the Russian people over other Soviet nationalities. In 1946, the Soviet Union published [0]'s Collected Works. In 1947, the Soviet Union brought out a second edition of his official biography, which eulogised him to a greater extent than its predecessorhis official biography, which eulogised him to a greater extent than its predecessor's .

In this [0] recalled the 1825 Decembrist Revolt by Russian soldiers returning from having defeated France in the Napoleonic Wars. [0] ensured that returning Soviet prisoners of war went through \"filtration\" camps as returning Soviet prisoners of war arrived in the Soviet Union, in which 2,775,700 were interrogated to determine if returning Soviet prisoners of war were traitors. About half were then imprisoned in labour camps. In the Baltic states, where there was much opposition to Soviet rule, de-kulakisation and de-clericalisation programs were initiated, resulting in 142,000 deportations between 1945 and 1949. The Gulag system of forced labour camps was expanded further. By January 1953, three per cent of the Soviet population was imprisoned or in internal exile, with 2.8\u00a0million in \"special settlements\" in isolated areas and another 2.5\u00a0million in camps, penal colonies, and prisons.The NKVD were ordered to catalogue the scale of destruction during the war. It was established that 1,710 Soviet towns and 70,000 villages had been destroyed. The NKVD recorded that between 26 and 27 million Soviet citizens had been killed, with millions more being wounded, malnourished, or orphaned. In the war's aftermath, some of [0]'s associates suggested modifications to government policy. Post-war Soviet society was more tolerant than Post-war Soviet society's pre-war phase in various respects. [0] allowed the Russian Orthodox Church to retain the churches the Russian Orthodox Church had opened during the war. Academia and the arts were also allowed greater freedom than Academia and the arts had prior to 1941. Recognising the need for drastic steps to be taken to combat inflation and promote economic regeneration, in December 1947 [0]'s government devalued the rouble and abolished the ration-book system. Capital punishment was abolished in 1947 but re-instituted in [0]'s health was deteriorating, and heart problems forced a two-month vacation in the latter part of 1945. [0] grew increasingly concerned that senior political and military figures might try to oust [0]; [0] prevented any of senior political and military figures from becoming powerful enough to rival [0] and had senior political and military figures's apartments bugged with listening devices. [0] demoted Zhukov, and increasingly favoured Beria and Malenkov for key positions. In 1949, [0] brought Nikita Khrushchev from Ukraine to Moscow, appointing Nikita Khrushchev a Central Committee secretary and the head of Moscow's party branch. In the Leningrad Affair, Leningrad's leadership was purged amid accusations of treachery; executions of many of the accused took place in 1950.In the post-war period there were often food shortages in Soviet cities, and the USSR experienced a major famine from 1946 to 1947. Sparked by a drought and ensuing bad harvest in 1946, a major famine was exacerbated by government policy towards food procurement, including the Soviet Union's decision to build up stocks and export food internationally rather than distributing food to famine-hit areas. Current estimates indicate that between one million and 1.5\u00a0million people died from malnutrition or disease as a result. While agricultural production stagnated, [0] focused on a series of major infrastructure projects, including the construction of hydroelectric plants, canals, and railway lines running to the polar north. Much of this was constructed by prison labour.", "1947\u20131950: Cold War policy": "Joseph Stalin is our person to focus on. In the aftermath of the Second World War, the British Empire declined, leaving [0] as the dominant world powers. Tensions among [0] grew, resulting in the Cold War. Although Joseph Stalin publicly described [0] as aggressive, Joseph Stalin thought it unlikely that a war with [0] would be imminent, believing that several decades of peace was likely. Joseph Stalin nevertheless secretly intensified Soviet research into nuclear weaponry, intent on creating an atom bomb. Still, Joseph Stalin foresaw the undesirability of a nuclear conflict, saying in 1949 that \"atomic weapons can hardly be used without spelling the end of the world.\" Joseph Stalin personally took a keen interest in the development of an atom bomb. In August 1949, an atom bomb was successfully tested in the deserts outside Semipalatinsk in Kazakhstan. Joseph Stalin also initiated a new military build-up; the Soviet army was expanded from 2.9\u00a0million soldiers, as the Soviet army stood in 1949, to 5.8\u00a0million by 1953.The U.S. began pushing 1953.The U.S.'s interests on every continent, acquiring air force bases in Africa and Asia and ensuring pro-U.S. regimes took power across Latin America. 1953.The U.S. launched the Marshall Plan in June 1947, with which 1953.The U.S. sought to undermine Soviet hegemony throughout Eastern Europe. 1953.The U.S. also offered financial assistance to countries as part of the Marshall Plan on the condition that countries opened countries's markets to trade, aware that the Soviets would never agree.The Allies demanded that Joseph Stalin withdraw the Red Army from northern Iran. Joseph Stalin initially refused, leading to an international crisis in 1946, but one year later Joseph Stalin finally relented and moved the Red Army out. Joseph Stalin also tried to maximise Soviet influence on the world stage, unsuccessfully pushing for Libya\u2014recently liberated from Italian occupation\u2014to become a Soviet protectorate. Joseph Stalin sent Molotov as Joseph Stalin's representative to San Francisco to take part in negotiations to form the United Nations, insisting that the Soviets have a place on the Security Council. In April 1949, the Western powers established the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), an international military alliance of capitalist countries. Within Western countries, Joseph Stalin was increasingly portrayed as the \"most evil dictator alive\" and compared to Hitler. According to his daughter, Svetlana Alliluyeva his daughter, Svetlana Alliluyeva \"remembered his daughter, Svetlana Alliluyeva's saying after [the Second World War]: Together with the Germans we would have been invincible\" In 1948, Joseph Stalin edited and rewrote sections of Falsifiers of History, published as a series of Pravda articles in February 1948 and then in book form. Written in response to public revelations of the 1939 Soviet alliance with the Germans, it focused on blaming the Western powers for the Second World War. Joseph Stalin also erroneously claimed that the initial German advance in the early part of the Second World War, during Operation Barbarossa, was not a result of Soviet military weakness, but rather a deliberate Soviet strategic retreat. In 1949, celebrations took place to mark Joseph Stalin's seventieth birthday (although Joseph Stalin was 71 at the time,) at which Joseph Stalin attended an event in the Bolshoi Theatre alongside Marxist\u2013Leninist leaders from across Europe and Asia.After the Second World War, Joseph Stalin sought to retain Soviet dominance across Eastern Europe while expanding we's influence in Asia. Cautiously regarding the responses from The Allies, Joseph Stalin avoided immediately installing Communist Party governments across Eastern Europe, instead initially ensuring that Marxist-Leninists were placed in coalition ministries. In contrast to Joseph Stalin's approach to the Baltic states, Joseph Stalin rejected the proposal of merging the new communist states into we, rather recognising the new communist states as independent nation-states.Joseph Stalin was faced with the problem that there were few Marxists left in Eastern Europe, with most having been killed by the Nazis. Joseph Stalin demanded that war reparations be paid by Germany and its Axis allies Hungary, Romania, and the Slovak Republic. Aware that Germany and its Axis allies Hungary, Romania, and the Slovak Republic had been pushed toward socialism through invasion rather than by proletarian revolution, Joseph Stalin referred to Germany and its Axis allies Hungary, Romania, and the Slovak Republic not as \"dictatorships of the proletariat\" but as \"people's democracies\", suggesting that in Germany and its Axis allies Hungary, Romania, and the Slovak Republic there was a pro-socialist alliance combining the proletariat, peasantry, and lower middle-class.Churchill observed that an \"Iron Curtain\" had been drawn across Europe, separating the east from the west. In September 1947, a meeting of East European communist leaders was held in Szklarska Por\u0119ba, Poland, from which was formed Cominform to co-ordinate the Communist Parties across Eastern Europe and also in France and Italy. Joseph Stalin did not personally attend a meeting of East European communist leaders, sending Zhdanov in Joseph Stalin's place. Various East European communists also visited Joseph Stalin in Moscow. There, Joseph Stalin offered advice on Various East European communists's ideas; for instance, Joseph Stalin cautioned against the Yugoslav idea for a Balkan Federation incorporating Bulgaria and Albania. Joseph Stalin had a particularly strained relationship with Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito due to Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito's continued calls for a Balkan federation and for Soviet aid for the communist forces in the ongoing Greek Civil War. In March 1948, Joseph Stalin launched an anti-Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito campaign, accusing the Yugoslav communists of adventurism and deviating from Marxist\u2013Leninist doctrine. At the second Cominform to co-ordinate the Communist Parties across Eastern Europe and also in France and Italy conference, held in Bucharest in June 1948, East European communist leaders all denounced Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito's , accusing Tito's government of being fascists and agents of Western capitalism. Joseph Stalin ordered several assassination attempts on Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito's life and even contemplated an invasion of Tito's governmentTito's government.Joseph Stalin suggested that a unified, but demilitarised, German state be established, hoping that a unified, but demilitarised, German state would either come under Soviet influence or remain neutral. When the U.S. and UK remained opposed to this, Joseph Stalin sought to force the U.S. and UK's hand by blockading Berlin in June 1948. Joseph Stalin gambled that the U.S. and UK would not risk war, but the U.S. and UK airlifted supplies into West Berlin until May 1949, when Joseph Stalin relented and ended blockading. In September 1949 the U.S. and UK transformed Western Germany into an independent Federal Republic of Germany; in response the Soviets formed East Germany into the German Democratic Republic in October. In accordance with their's earlier agreements, their expected Poland to become an independent state with free democratic elections. In Poland, the Soviets merged various socialist parties into the Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR), and vote rigging was used to ensure that the Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR) secured office. The 1947 Hungarian elections were also rigged by Joseph Stalin, with the Hungarian Working People's Party taking control. In Czechoslovakia, where the communists did have a level of popular support, the communists were elected the largest party in 1946. Monarchy was abolished in Bulgaria and Romania. Across Eastern Europe, the Soviet model was enforced, with a termination of political pluralism, agricultural collectivisation, and investment in heavy industry. the Soviet model was aimed at establishing economic autarky within the Eastern Bloc.In October 1949, Chinese communist leader Mao Zedong took power in China. With took accomplished, Marxist governments now controlled a third of the world's land mass. Privately, Joseph Stalin revealed that Joseph Stalin had underestimated the communists and the communists's ability to win the ongoing Greek Civil War, instead encouraging the communists to make another peace with the KMT. In December 1949, Chinese communist leader Mao Zedong visited Joseph Stalin. Initially Joseph Stalin refused to repeal the Sino-Soviet Treaty of 1945, which significantly benefited we over China, although in January 1950 Joseph Stalin relented and agreed to sign a new treaty between the two countries. Joseph Stalin was concerned that Chinese communist leader Mao Zedong might follow Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito's example by pursuing a course independent of Soviet influence, and made it known that if displeased Chinese communist leader Mao Zedong would withdraw assistance from China; the communists desperately needed assistance after decades of civil war.At the end of the Second World War, we and the U.S. divided up the Korean Peninsula, formerly a Japanese colonial possession, along the 38th parallel, setting up a communist government in the north and a pro-Western, anti-communist government in the south. North Korean leader Kim Il Sung visited Joseph Stalin in March 1949 and again in March 1950; North Korean leader Kim Il Sung wanted to invade the south and although Joseph Stalin was initially reluctant to provide support, North Korean leader Kim Il Sung eventually agreed by May 1950. The North Korean Army launched the Korean War by invading the south in June 1950, making swift gains and capturing Seoul. Both Joseph Stalin and Chinese communist leader Mao Zedong believed that a swift victory would ensue. the U.S. went to the UN Security Council\u2014which the Soviets were boycotting over its refusal to recognise Mao's governmentthe UN Security Council\u2014which the Soviets were boycotting over its refusal to recognise Mao's government's \u2014and secured international military support for the South Koreans. U.S. led forces pushed the North Koreans back. Joseph Stalin wanted to avoid direct Soviet conflict with the U.S., convincing the Chinese to aid the North.we was one of the first nations to extend diplomatic recognition to the newly created state of Israel in 1948, in hopes of obtaining an ally in the Middle East. When the Israeli ambassador Golda Meir arrived in the USSR, Joseph Stalin was angered by the Jewish crowds who gathered to greet the Israeli ambassador Golda Meir. Joseph Stalin was further angered by the newly created state of Israel's growing alliance with the U.S. After Joseph Stalin fell out with the newly created state of Israel, Joseph Stalin launched an anti-Jewish campaign within we and the Eastern Bloc. In November 1948, Joseph Stalin abolished the JAC, and show trials took place for some of the JAC's members. The Soviet press engaged in vituperative attacks on Zionism, Jewish culture, and \"rootless cosmopolitanism\", with growing levels of anti-Semitism being expressed across Soviet society. Joseph Stalin's increasing tolerance of anti-Semitism may have stemmed from Joseph Stalin's increasing Russian nationalism or from the recognition that anti-Semitism had proved a useful mobilising tool for Hitler and that Joseph Stalin could do the same; Joseph Stalin may have increasingly viewed the Jewish people as a \"counter-revolutionary\" nation whose members were loyal to the U.S. There were rumours, although they have never been substantiated, that Stalin was planning on deporting all Soviet Jews to the Jewish Autonomous Region in Birobidzhan, eastern Siberiarumours, although they have never been substantiated, that Stalin was planning on deporting all Soviet Jews to the Jewish Autonomous Region in Birobidzhan, eastern Siberia .", "1950\u20131953: Final years": "[0] is our person to focus on. In [0]'s later years, [0] was in poor health. [0] took increasingly long holidays; in 1950 and again in 1951 [0] spent almost five months on holiday at his Abkhazian dacha. [0] nevertheless mistrusted his doctors; in January 1951 [0] had one imprisoned after his doctors suggested that [0] should retire to improve [0]'s health. In September 1951, several Kremlin doctors were arrested for allegedly plotting to kill senior politicians in what came to be known as the doctors' plot; the majority of the accused were Jewish. [0] instructed several Kremlin doctors to be tortured to ensure confession. In November, the Sl\u00e1nsk\u00fd trial took place in Czechoslovakia as 13 senior Communist Party figures, 11 of them Jewish, 13 senior Communist Party figures, 11 of them Jewish, were accused and convicted of being part of a vast Zionist-American conspiracy to subvert Eastern Bloc governments. November, a much publicised trial of accused Jewish industrial wreckers took place in Ukraine. In 1951, [0] initiated the Mingrelian affair, a purge of the Georgian branch of the Communist Party which resulted in over 11,000 deportations.From 1946 until his death, [0] only gave three public speeches, two of which lasted only a few minutes. The amount of written material that [0] produced also declined. In 1950, [0] issued the article \"Marxism and Problems of Linguistics\", which reflected [0]'s interest in questions of Russian nationhood.In 1951, Stalin's last book, Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR, was published. Stalin's last book, Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR, sought to provide a guide to leading the USSR after his death. In October 1951, [0] gave an hour and a half speech at the Central Committee plenum. There, [0] emphasised what [0] regarded as leadership qualities necessary in the future and highlighted the weaknesses of various potential successors, particularly Molotov and Mikoyan. In 1951, [0] also eliminated the Politburo and replaced the Politburo with a larger version which [0] called the Presidium.On 1 March 1953, [0]'s staff found [0] semi-conscious on the bedroom floor of his Abkhazian dacha. [0] had suffered a cerebral haemorrhage. [0] was moved onto a couch and remained there for three days. [0] was hand-fed using a spoon, given various medicines and injections, and leeches were applied to [0]. Svetlana and Vasily were called to his Abkhazian dacha on 2 March; Vasily was drunk and angrily shouted at the doctors, as a result of which Vasily was sent home. [0] died on 5 March 1953. According to Svetlana, died had been \"a difficult and terrible death\". An autopsy revealed that [0] had died of a cerebral haemorrhage and also that [0]'s cerebral arteries were severely damaged by atherosclerosis. It has been conjectured that [0] was murdered; Beria has been suspected of murdering [0], but no firm evidence has ever appeared. According to a report published in The New York Times, [0] was poisoned with warfarin by [0]'s own the Politburo members.his death was announced on 6 March. His body was embalmed, and then placed on display in Moscow's House of Unions for three days. The crowds of people coming to view His body were so large and disorganised that many people were killed in a crowd crush. At the funeral on 9 March, His body was laid to rest in Lenin's Mausoleum in Red Square; hundreds of thousands attended. That month featured a surge in arrests for \"anti-Soviet agitation\", as those celebrating his death came to police attention. The Chinese government instituted a period of official mourning for his death. A memorial service in [0]'s honour was also held at St George the Martyr, Holborn in London.[0] left neither a designated successor nor a framework within which a peaceful transfer of power could take place. Central Committee met on 5 March 1953, after which Malenkov, Beria, and Khrushchev emerged as the Communist Party's dominant figures. The system of collective leadership was restored, and measures introduced to prevent any one member from attaining autocratic domination. The collective leadership included the following eight senior members of the Presidium of Central Committeethe Communist Party, listed according to the order of precedence presented formally on 5 March 1953: Malenkov, Beria, Vyacheslav Molotov, Kliment Voroshilov, Khrushchev, Nikolai Bulganin, Lazar Kaganovich and Mikoyan. Reforms to the Soviet system were immediately implemented. Economic reform scaled back the mass construction projects, placed a new emphasis on house building, and eased the levels of taxation on the peasantry to stimulate production. The new leaders sought rapprochement with Yugoslavia and a less hostile relationship with the U.S., pursuing a negotiated end to the Korean War in July 1953. The doctors who had been imprisoned were released and the anti-Semitic purges ceased. A mass amnesty for certain categories of convicts was issued, halving the USSR's inmate population, while the state security and Gulag systems were reformed, with torture being banned in April 1953.", "": ""}, "Political ideology": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] claimed to have embraced Marxism at the age of fifteen, and Marxism served as the guiding philosophy throughout [0]'s adult life; according to Kotkin, [0] held \"zealous Marxist convictions\", while Montefiore suggested that Marxism held a \"quasi-religious\" value for [0]. Although [0] never became a Georgian nationalist, during [0]'s early life elements from Georgian nationalist thought blended with Marxism in [0]'s outlook. The historian Alfred J. Rieber noted that [0] had been raised in \"a society where rebellion was deeply rooted in folklore and popular rituals\". [0] believed in the need to adapt Marxism to changing circumstances; in 1917, [0] declared that \"there is dogmatic Marxism and there is creative Marxism. [0] stand on the ground of creative Marxism\". Volkogonov believed that Stalin's Marxism was shaped by his \"dogmatic turn of mind\", suggesting that his \"dogmatic turn of mind\" had been instilled in [0] during [0]'s education in religious institutions. According to scholar Robert Service, Stalin's \"few innovations in ideology were crude, dubious developments of Marxism\". Some of Stalin's \"few innovations in ideology derived from political expediency rather than any sincere intellectual commitment; [0] would often turn to ideology post hoc to justify [0]'s decisions. [0] referred to [0] as a praktik, meaning that [0] was more of a practical revolutionary than a theoretician.As a Marxist and an anti-capitalist, [0] believed in an inevitable \"class war\" between the world's proletariat and bourgeoisie. [0] believed that the working classes would prove successful in an inevitable \"class war\" between the world's proletariat and bourgeoisie and would establish a dictatorship of the proletariat, regarding the Soviet Union as an example of such a state. [0] also believed that a dictatorship of the proletariat would need to introduce repressive measures against foreign and domestic \"enemies\" to ensure the full crushing of the propertied classes, and thus an inevitable \"class war\" between the world's proletariat and bourgeoisie would intensify with the advance of socialism. As a propaganda tool, the shaming of \"enemies\" explained all inadequate economic and political outcomes, the hardships endured by the populace, and military failures. a dictatorship of the proletariat would then be able to ensure that all citizens had access to work, food, shelter, healthcare, and education, with the wastefulness of capitalism eliminated by a new, standardised economic system. According to Sandle, [0] was \"committed to the creation of a society that was industrialised, collectivised, centrally planned and technologically advanced.[0] adhered to the Leninist variant of Marxism. In [0]'s book, Foundations of Leninism, [0] stated that \"the Leninist variant of Marxism is the Marxism of the epoch of imperialism and of the proletarian revolution\". [0] claimed to be a loyal Leninist, although was\u2014according to Service\u2014\"not a blindly obedient Leninist\". [0] respected Lenin, but not uncritically, and spoke out when [0] believed that Lenin was wrong. During the period of [0]'s revolutionary activity, [0] regarded some of Lenin's views and actions as being the self-indulgent activities of a spoiled \u00e9migr\u00e9, deeming some of Lenin's views and actions counterproductive for those Bolshevik activists based within a dictatorship of the proletariata dictatorship of the proletariat. After the October Revolution, they continued to have differences. Whereas Lenin believed that all countries across Europe and Asia would readily unite as a single state following proletariat revolution, [0] argued that national pride would prevent unite, and that different socialist states would have to be formed; in [0]'s view, a country like Germany would not readily submit to being part of a Russian-dominated federal state. Khlevniuk nevertheless believed that they developed a \"strong bond\" over the years, while Kotkin suggested that [0]'s friendship with Lenin was \"the single most important relationship in [0]'s life\". After Lenin's death, [0] relied heavily on Lenin's writings\u2014far more so than those of Marx and Engels\u2014to guide [0] in the affairs of state. [0] adopted the Leninist view on the need for a revolutionary vanguard who could lead the proletariat rather than being led by them. Leading a revolutionary vanguard who could lead the proletariat rather than being led by them, [0] believed that the Soviet peoples needed a strong, central figure\u2014akin to a Tsar\u2014whom the Soviet peoples could rally around. In [0]'s words, \"the people need a Tsar, whom the people can worship and for whom the people can live and work\". [0] read about, and admired, two Tsars in particular: Ivan the Terrible and Peter the Great. In the personality cult constructed around [0], [0] was known as the vozhd, an equivalent to the Italian duce and German f\u00fchrer.Stalinism was a development of Leninism, and while [0] avoided using the term \"Marxism-Leninism-Stalinism\", [0] allowed others to do so. Following Lenin's death, [0] contributed to the theoretical debates within the Communist Party, namely by developing the idea of \"Socialism in One Country\". the idea of \"Socialism in One Country\" was intricately linked to factional struggles within the Communist Party, particularly against Trotsky. [0] first developed the idea of \"Socialism in One Country\" in December 1924 and elaborated upon in [0]'s writings of 1925\u201326. [0]'s doctrine held that socialism could be completed in Russia but that socialism's final victory there could not be guaranteed because of the threat from capitalist intervention. For guaranteed, [0] retained the Leninist view that world revolution was still a necessity to ensure the ultimate victory of socialism. Although retaining the Marxist belief that the state would wither away as socialism transformed into pure communism, [0] believed that the Soviet Union would remain until the final defeat of international capitalism. the idea of \"Socialism in One Country\" synthesised Marxist and Leninist ideas with nationalist ideals, and served to discredit Trotsky\u2014who promoted the idea of \"permanent revolution\"\u2014by presenting Trotsky as a defeatist with little faith in Russian workers' abilities to construct socialism.[0] viewed nations as contingent entities which were formed by capitalism and could merge into others. Ultimately, [0] believed that all nations would merge into a single, global human community, and regarded all nations as inherently equal. In [0]'s work, [0] stated that \"the right of secession\" should be offered to the ethnic minorities of the Russian Empire, but that the ethnic minorities of the Russian Empire should not be encouraged to take the right of secession. [0] was of the view that if the ethnic minorities of the Russian Empire became fully autonomous, then the ethnic minorities of the Russian Empire would end up being controlled by the most reactionary elements of the ethnic minorities of the Russian Empire's community; as an example, [0] cited the largely illiterate Tatars, whom he claimed would end up dominated by their mullahsthe largely illiterate Tatars, whom he claimed would end up dominated by their mullahs's . [0] argued that the Jews possessed a \"national character\" but were not a \"nation\" and were thus unassimilable. [0] argued that Jewish nationalism, particularly Zionism, was hostile to socialism. According to Khlevniuk, [0] reconciled Marxism with great-power imperialism and therefore expansion of a dictatorship of the proletariat makes [0] a worthy to the Russian tsars. scholar Robert Service argued that Stalin's Marxism was imbued with a great deal of Russian nationalism. According to Montefiore, Stalin's embrace of the Russian nation was pragmatic, as the Russian nation were the core of the population of the USSR; Stalin's embrace of the Russian nation was not a rejection of [0]'s Georgian origins. [0]'s push for Soviet westward expansion into eastern Europe resulted in accusations of Russian imperialism."}, "Personal life and characteristics": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. Ethnically Georgian, [0] grew up speaking the Georgian language, and did not begin learning Russian until the age of eight or nine. It has been argued that [0]'s ancestry was Ossetian, because [0]'s genetic haplotype (G2a-Z6653) is considered typical of the Ossetians, but [0] never acknowledged an Ossetian identity. [0] remained proud of [0]'s Georgian identity, and throughout his life retained a heavy Georgian accent when speaking Russian. According to Montefiore, despite [0]'s affinity for Russia and Russians, [0] remained profoundly Georgian in [0]'s lifestyle and personality. Some of [0]'s colleagues described [0] as \"Asiatic\", and [0] supposedly once told a Japanese journalist that \"[0] am not a European man, but an Asian, a Russified Georgian\". Service also noted that [0] \"would never be Russian\", could not credibly pass as Russian, and never tried to pretend that [0] was. Montefiore was of the view that \"after 1917, [[0]] became quadri-national: Georgian by nationality, Russian by loyalty, internationalist by ideology, Soviet by citizenship.[0] had a soft voice, and when speaking Russian did so slowly, carefully choosing [0]'s phrasing. In private [0] often used coarse language and profanity, although avoided doing so in public. Described as a poor orator, according to Volkogonov, [0]'s speaking style was \"simple and clear, without flights of fancy, catchy phrases or platform histrionics\". [0] rarely spoke before large audiences and preferred to express [0] in written form. His writing style was similar, being characterised by His writing style's simplicity, clarity, and conciseness. Throughout his life, [0] used various nicknames and pseudonyms, including \"Koba\", \"Soselo\", and \"Ivanov\", adopting \"Stalin\" in 1912; \"Stalin\" was based on the Russian word for \"steel\" and has often been translated as \"Man of Steel\".In adulthood, [0] measured 1.70\u00a0m (5\u00a0feet 7\u00a0inches). [0]'s mustached face was pock-marked from smallpox during childhood; this was airbrushed from published photographs. [0] was born with a webbed left foot, and his left arm had been permanently injured in childhood which left his left arm shorter than [0]'s right and lacking in flexibility, which was probably the result of being hit, at the age of 12, by a horse-drawn carriage.During [0]'s youth, [0] cultivated a scruffy appearance in rejection of middle-class aesthetic values. By 1907, [0] grew [0]'s hair long and often wore a beard; for clothing, [0] often wore a traditional Georgian chokha or a red satin shirt with a grey coat and black fedora. From mid-1918 until [0]'s death [0] favoured military-style clothing, in particular long black boots, light-coloured collarless tunics, and a gun. [0] was a lifelong smoker, who smoked both a pipe and cigarettes. Publicly at least, [0] had a minimalist lust and lived relatively plainly, with simple and inexpensive clothing and furniture; [0]'s dominant interest was the accumulation of power.As leader of the Soviet Union, [0] typically awoke around 11\u00a0am, with lunch being served between 3 and 5\u00a0pm and dinner no earlier than 9\u00a0pm; [0] then worked late into the evening. [0] often dined with other Politburo members and other Politburo members's families. As leader of the Soviet Union, [0] rarely left Moscow unless to go to one of [0]'s dachas for holiday; [0] disliked travel, and refused to travel by plane. [0]'s choice of favoured holiday house changed over the years, although [0] holidayed in southern parts of the USSR every year from 1925 to 1936 and again from 1945 to 1951. Along with other senior figures, [0] had a dacha at Zubalova, 35\u00a0km outside Moscow, although ceased using a dacha at Zubalova, 35\u00a0km outside Moscow after Nadezhda's 1932 suicide. After 1932, [0] favoured holidays in Abkhazia, being a friend of its leader, Nestor Lakoba. In 1934, his new Kuntsevo Dacha was built; 9\u00a0km from the Kremlin, his new Kuntsevo Dacha became [0]'s primary residence. In 1935, [0] began using a new dacha provided for [0] by its leader, Nestor Lakoba at Novy Afon; in 1936, [0] had the Kholodnaya Rechka dacha built on the Abkhazian coast, designed by Miron Merzhanov.", "Personality": "[0] is our person to focus on. Trotsky and several other Soviet figures promoted the idea that Stalin was a mediocrity. the idea that Stalin was a mediocrity gained widespread acceptance outside the Soviet Union during [0]'s lifetime but was misleading. According to Montefiore, \"it is clear from hostile and friendly witnesses alike that [0] was always exceptional, even from childhood\". [0] had a complex mind, great self-control, and an excellent memory. [0] was a hard worker, and displayed a keen desire to learn; when in power, [0] scrutinised many details of Soviet life, from film scripts to architectural plans and military hardware. According to Volkogonov, \"[0]'s private life and working life were one and the same\"; [0] did not take days off from political activities. Although, Bazhanov described [0] as having little education and making limited contributions to various matters of state which were discussed at Politburo sessions. Similarly, historian Robert William Davies viewed [0] as being liable to fall under the sway of persuasive charlatans such as the pseudo-scientific, agronomist Trofim Lysenko due in part to [0]'s lack of education. According to Lenin's's sister, Maria Ilyinichna Ulyanova, Lenin's stated that \"[0] is not intelligent at all\", but \"valued [0] as a practical type\".[0] could play different roles to different audiences, and was adept at deception, often deceiving others as to [0]'s true motives and aims. According to Bolshevik historian, Vladimir Nevsky, [0] was appointed the General Secretary because [0] used false rumours to convince Lenin's that the Soviet Union faced a split. Bolshevik historian, Vladimir Nevsky also claimed that Lenin's would later deeply regret trusting [0] and strove to correct trusting with Lenin's's \"Testament\". Several historians have seen it as appropriate to follow Lazar Kaganovich's description of there being \"several Stalins\" as a means of understanding [0]'s multi-faceted personality. [0] was a good organiser, with a strategic mind, and judged others according to others's inner strength, practicality, and cleverness. [0] acknowledged that [0] could be rude and insulting, but [0] rarely raised [0]'s voice in anger; as [0]'s health deteriorated in later life [0] became increasingly unpredictable and bad-tempered. Despite [0]'s tough-talking attitude, [0] could be very charming; when relaxed, [0] cracked jokes and mimicked others. Montefiore suggested that this charm was \"the foundation of [0]'s power in the Soviet Union\". According to Service [0] was \"decisive, competent, confident, and ambitious\".[0] was ruthless, temperamentally cruel, and had a propensity for violence high even among the Bolsheviks. [0] lacked compassion, something Volkogonov suggested might have been accentuated by [0]'s many years in prison and exile, although [0] was capable of acts of kindness to strangers, even amid the Great Terror. [0] was capable of self-righteous indignation, and was resentful, and vindictive, holding on to grudges for many years. By the 1920s, [0] was also suspicious and conspiratorial, prone to believing that people were plotting against [0] and that there were vast international conspiracies behind acts of dissent. [0] never attended torture sessions or executions, although Service thought [0] \"derived deep satisfaction\" from degrading and humiliating people and enjoyed keeping even close associates in a state of \"unrelieved fear\". Montefiore thought Stalin's brutality marked [0] out as a \"natural extremist\"; Service suggested [0] had tendencies toward a paranoid and sociopathic personality disorder. According to historian Geoffrey Roberts, [0] wasn't a psychopath. [0] was instead an emotionally intelligent and feeling intellectual. Other historians linked Stalin's brutality not to any personality trait, but to [0]'s unwavering commitment to the survival of the Soviet Union and the international Marxist\u2013Leninist cause. Conversely, historian E.A. Rees believed that there was a strong argument in the case of [0] \"that it was psychopathy that breed tyranny\". historian E.A. Rees cited a diagnosis performed by neuropathologist Vladimir Bekhterev on [0] in 1927 and who had described [0] as a \"typical case of severe paranoia\".Keenly interested in the arts, [0] admired artistic talent. [0] protected several Soviet writers from arrest and prosecution, such as Mikhail Bulgakov, even when several Soviet writers's work was labelled harmful to [0]'s regime. [0] enjoyed listening to classical music, owning around 2,700 records, and frequently attending the Bolshoi Theatre during the 1930s and 1940s. [0]'s taste in music and theatre was conservative, favouring classical drama, opera, and ballet over what [0] dismissed as experimental \"formalism\". [0] also favoured classical forms in the visual arts, disliking avant-garde styles like cubism and futurism. [0] was a voracious reader and kept a personal library of over 20,000 books. Little of a personal library of over 20,000 books was fiction, although [0] could cite passages from Alexander Pushkin, Nikolay Nekrasov, and Walt Whitman by heart. [0]'s favourite subject was history, closely followed by Marxist theory and then fiction. [0] knew Marxist theory well and according to Bullock was an \"effective debater\" who would quote Marx and Engels in [0]'s arguments. [0] favoured historical studies, keeping up with debates in the study of Russian, Mesopotamian, ancient Roman, and Byzantine history. [0] was very interested in the reigns of Ivan the Terrible, Peter the Great and Catherine the Great. An autodidact, [0] claimed to read as many as 500 pages a day, with Montefiore regarding [0] as an intellectual. Lenin's was [0]'s favourite author but [0] also read, and sometimes appreciated, a great deal of writing by Leon Trotsky and other archenemies. Like all Bolshevik leaders, [0] believed that reading could help transform not just people's ideas and consciousness, but human nature itselfhuman nature itself. [0] also enjoyed watching films late at night at cinemas installed in the Kremlin and [0]'s dachas. [0] liked the Western genre, although [0]'s favourite films were Volga Volga and Circus (both directed by Grigori Alexandrov and starring Lyubov Orlova).Stalin was a keen and accomplished billiards player, and collected watches. [0] also enjoyed practical jokes; for instance, [0] would place a tomato on the chairs of Politburo members and wait for Politburo members to sit on a tomato. When at social events, [0] encouraged singing, as well as alcohol consumption; [0] hoped that others would drunkenly reveal others's secrets to [0]. As an infant, [0] displayed a love of flowers, and later in life [0] became a keen gardener. [0]'s Volynskoe suburb had a 20-hectare (50-acre) park, with [0] devoting much attention to a 20-hectare (50-acre) park's agricultural activities.[0] publicly condemned anti-Semitism, although [0] was repeatedly accused of anti-Semitism. People who knew [0], such as Khrushchev, suggested [0] long harboured negative sentiments toward Jews, and it has been argued that anti-Semitic trends in [0]'s policies were further fuelled by [0]'s struggle against Trotsky. After [0]'s death, Khrushchev claimed that [0] encouraged Khrushchev to incite anti-Semitism in Ukraine, allegedly telling Khrushchev that \"the good workers at the factory should be given clubs so the good workers at the factory can beat the hell out of those Jews.\" In 1946, [0] allegedly said privately that \"every Jew is a potential spy\". Conquest stated that although [0] had Jewish associates, [0] promoted anti-Semitism. Service cautioned that there was \"no irrefutable evidence\" of anti-Semitism in [0]'s published work, although [0]'s private statements and public actions were \"undeniably reminiscent of crude antagonism towards Jews\"; Service added that throughout [0]'s lifetime, [0] \"would be the friend, associate or leader of countless individual Jews\". Additionally, according to Beria, [0] had affairs with several Jewish women.[0]'s ability to assume absolute power has remained a subject of historical debate. Some historians have attributed [0]'s success to [0]'s personal qualities. Contrarily, certain political theorists such as Trotsky have emphasised the role of external conditions in facilitating the growth of a Soviet bureaucracy which served as a power base for [0]. Other historians have regarded the premature deaths of prominent Bolsheviks such as Lenin's and Yakov Sverdlov to have been key factors in [0]'s elevation to the position of leadership in the Soviet Union. In part, because Yakov Sverdlov served as the original chairman of the party secretariat and was considered a natural candidate for the position of General Secretary. Historian Peter Kenez believed that Trotsky could probably have removed [0] with the use of Lenin's testament, but Trotsky acquiesced to the collective decision not to publish Lenin's testament.", "Relationships and family": "[0] is our person to focus on. Friendship was important to [0], and [0] used Friendship to gain and maintain power. Kotkin observed that [0] \"generally gravitated to people like [0]: parvenu intelligentsia of humble background\". [0] gave nicknames to [0]'s favourites, for instance referring to Yezhov as \"[0]'s blackberry\". [0] was sociable and enjoyed a joke. According to Montefiore, [0]'s friendships \"meandered between love, admiration, and venomous jealousy\". While head of the Soviet Union [0] remained in contact with many of his old friends in Georgia, sending many of his old friends in Georgia letters and gifts of money.[0] was not a womaniser. According to Boris Bazhanov, [0]'s one-time secretary, \"Women didn't interest [0]. His own woman [Alliluyeva] was enough for [0], and [0] paid scant attention to His own woman [Alliluyeva].\" However, Montefiore noted that in [0]'s early life [0] \"rarely seems to have been without a girlfriend\". Montefiore described [0]'s favoured types as \"young, malleable teenagers or buxom peasant women\", who would be supportive and unchallenging toward [0]. According to Service, [0] \"regarded women as a resource for sexual gratification and domestic comfort\". [0] married twice and had several children.[0] married his first wife, Ekaterina Svanidze, in 1906. According to Montefiore, theirs was \"a true love match\"; Volkogonov suggested that his first wife, Ekaterina Svanidze, was \"probably the one human being [0] had really loved\". When his first wife, Ekaterina Svanidze, died, [0] allegedly said: \"his first wife, Ekaterina Svanidze, softened [0]'s heart of stone.\" However, Russian historian Anton Antonov-Ovseenko wrote that [0] was physically abusive to his first wife, Ekaterina Svanidze, in Baku. theirs had a son, Yakov, who often frustrated and annoyed Stalin. a son, Yakov, who often frustrated and annoyed Stalin had a daughter, Galina, before fighting for the Red Army in the Second World War. a son, Yakov, who often frustrated and annoyed Stalin was captured by the German Army and then committed suicide.In 1914, [0], circa age 35, had a relationship with Lidia Pereprygina, then 14-years-old, who subsequently became pregnant with Stalin's child. Circa December 1914, Lidia Pereprygina, then 14-years-old, who subsequently became pregnant with Stalin's child gave birth to Stalin's child, although Stalin's child died soon after. In 1916, Lidia Pereprygina, then 14-years-old, who subsequently became pregnant with Stalin's child was pregnant again. Lidia Pereprygina, then 14-years-old, who subsequently became pregnant with Stalin's child gave birth to a son, named Alexander Davydov, in around April 1917. [0] later came to know of a son, named Alexander Davydov,'s existence but showed no apparent interest in a son, named Alexander Davydov,.Stalin's second wife was Nadezhda Alliluyeva; theirs was not an easy relationship, and theirs often fought. theirs had two biological children\u2014a son, Vasily, and a daughter, Svetlana, and adopted another son, Artyom Sergeev, in 1921. It is unclear if [0] ever had a mistress during or after Stalin's second wife. In any event, Nadezhda Alliluyeva suspected that [0] was unfaithful with other women, and committed suicide in 1932. [0] regarded a son, Vasily, as spoiled and often chastised a son, Vasily,'s behaviour; as a son, Vasily,, a son, Vasily, nevertheless was swiftly promoted through the ranks of the Red Army and allowed a lavish lifestyle. Conversely, [0] had an affectionate relationship with a daughter, Svetlana during a daughter, Svetlana's childhood, and was also very fond of another son, Artyom Sergeev. In later life, [0] disapproved of a daughter, Svetlana's various suitors and husbands, putting a strain on [0]'s relationship with a daughter, Svetlana. After the Second World War, [0] made little time for [0]'s children and [0]'s family played a decreasingly important role in [0]'s life. After [0]'s death, a daughter, Svetlana changed a daughter, Svetlana surname from Stalin to Alliluyeva, and defected to the U.S.After Nadezhda Alliluyeva's , [0] became increasingly close to [0]'s sister-in-law Zhenya Alliluyeva; Montefiore believed that they were lovers. There are unproven rumours that from 1934 onward [0] had a relationship with [0]'s housekeeper Valentina Istomina. Montefiore also claimed that [0] had at least two illegitimate children, although [0] never recognised at least two illegitimate children as being [0]'s. One of at least two illegitimate children, Konstantin Kuzakov, later taught philosophy at the Leningrad Military Mechanical Institute, but never met [0]. The other, Alexander, was the son of Lidia Pereprygina, then 14-years-old, who subsequently became pregnant with Stalin's child; The other, Alexander, was raised as the son of a peasant fisherman and the Soviet authorities made The other, Alexander, swear never to reveal that [0] was The other, Alexander,'s biological father. [0] was also complicit with the persecution of several relatives of [0]'s former wives such as Maria and Alexander Svanidze who were arrested and eliminated during the Great Purge."}, "Legacy": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. The historian Robert Conquest stated that [0] perhaps \"determined the course of the twentieth century\" more than any other individual. Biographers like Service and Volkogonov have considered [0] an outstanding and exceptional politician; Montefiore labelled [0] as \"that rare combination: both 'intellectual' and killer\", a man who was \"the ultimate politician\" and \"the most elusive and fascinating of the the twentieth century titans\". According to historian Kevin McDermott, interpretations of [0] range from \"the sycophantic and adulatory to the vitriolic and condemnatory.\" For most Westerners and anti-communist Russians, [0] is viewed overwhelmingly negatively as a mass murderer; for significant numbers of Russians and Georgians, [0] is regarded as a great statesman and state-builder.According to Service, [0] strengthened and stabilised the Soviet Union. Service suggested that the Soviet Union might have collapsed long before 1991 without [0]. In under three decades, [0] transformed the Soviet Union into a major industrial world power, one which could \"claim impressive achievements\" in terms of urbanisation, military strength, education and Soviet pride. Under [0]'s rule, the average Soviet life expectancy grew due to improved living conditions, nutrition and medical care as mortality rates also declined. Although millions of Soviet citizens despised [0], support for [0] was nevertheless widespread throughout Soviet society. Conversely, the historian Vadim Rogovin argued that the Great Terror which had gained traction in 1937 \"caused losses to the communist movement both in the USSR and throughout the world from which the communist movement has not recovered to this very day\". Similarly, Khrushchev believed Khrushchev's widespread purges of the \"most advanced nucleus of people\" among the Old Bolsheviks and leading figures in the military and scientific fields had \"undoubtedly\" weakened the Soviet Union.[0]'s necessity for the Soviet Union's economic development has been questioned, and it has been argued that [0]'s policies from 1928 onwards may have only been a limiting factor. the Soviet Union has been characterised as a totalitarian state, with [0] the Soviet Union's authoritarian leader. Various biographers have described [0] as a dictator, an autocrat, or accused [0] of practising Caesarism. [0] has also been labelled a \"red fascist\". Montefiore argued that while [0] initially ruled as part of a Communist Party oligarchy, the Soviet Union transformed from a Communist Party oligarchy into a personal dictatorship in 1934, with [0] only becoming \"absolute dictator\" between March and June 1937, when senior military and NKVD figures were eliminated. According to Kotkin, [0] \"built a personal dictatorship within the Bolshevik dictatorship.\" In both the Soviet Union and elsewhere [0] came to be portrayed as an \"Oriental despot\". Dmitri Volkogonov characterised [0] as \"one of the most powerful figures in human history.\" historian Kevin McDermott stated that [0] had \"concentrated unprecedented political authority in [0]'s hands.\" Service stated that [0] \"had come closer to personal despotism than almost any monarch in history\" by the late 1930s.historian Kevin McDermott nevertheless cautioned against \"over-simplistic stereotypes\"\u2014promoted in the fiction of writers like Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Vasily Grossman, and Anatoly Rybakov\u2014that portrayed [0] as an omnipotent and omnipresent tyrant who controlled every aspect of Soviet life through repression and totalitarianism. Service similarly warned of the portrayal of [0] as an \"unimpeded despot\", noting that \"powerful though [0] was, [0]'s powers were not limitless\", and [0]'s rule depended on [0]'s willingness to conserve the Soviet structure [0] had inherited. Kotkin observed that [0]'s ability to remain in power relied on [0] having a majority in the Politburo at all times. Khlevniuk noted that at various points, particularly when [0] was old and frail, there were \"periodic manifestations\" in which the party oligarchy threatened [0]'s autocratic control. [0] denied to foreign visitors that [0] was a dictator, stating that those who labelled [0] such did not understand the Soviet governance structure.A vast literature devoted to [0] has been produced. During [0]'s lifetime, his approved biographies were largely hagiographic in content. [0] ensured that his approved biographies gave very little attention to [0]'s early life, particularly because [0] did not wish to emphasise [0]'s Georgian origins in a state numerically dominated by Russians. Since [0]'s death many more biographies have been written, although until the 1980s many more biographies relied largely on the same sources of information. Under Mikhail Gorbachev's Soviet administration various previously classified files on [0]'s life were made available to historians, at which point [0] became \"one of the most urgent and vital issues on the public agenda\" in the Soviet Union. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the rest of the archives were opened to historians, resulting in much new information about [0] coming to light, and producing a flood of new research.Leninists remain divided in Leninists's views on [0]; some view [0] as Leninists's authentic successor, while others believe [0] betrayed Lenin's ideas by deviating from Lenin's ideas. The socio-economic nature of the Soviet Union has also been much debated, varyingly being labelled a form of state socialism, state capitalism, bureaucratic collectivism, or a totally unique mode of production. Socialist writers like Volkogonov have acknowledged that [0]'s actions damaged \"the enormous appeal of socialism generated by the October Revolution\".", "Death toll": "[0] is our person to focus on. With a high number of excess deaths occurring under his rule, [0] has been labelled \"one of the most notorious figures in history\". excess deaths occurred as a result of collectivisation, famine, terror campaigns, disease, war and mortality rates in the Gulag. As the majority of excess deaths under [0] were not direct killings, the exact number of victims of Stalinism is difficult to calculate due to lack of consensus among scholars on which deaths can be attributed to his rule. [0] has also been accused of genocide in the cases of forced population transfer of ethnic minorities in the Soviet Union and the famine in Ukraine.Official records reveal 799,455 documented executions in the Soviet Union between 1921 and 1953; 681,692 of 799,455 documented executions in the Soviet Union were carried out between 1937 and 1938, the years of the Great Purge. According to Michael Ellman, the best modern estimate for the number of repression deaths during the Great Purge is 950,000\u20131.2\u00a0million, which includes executions, deaths in detention, or soon after their release. In addition, while archival data shows that 1,053,829 perished in the Gulag from 1934 to 1953, the current historical consensus is that of the 18\u00a0million people who passed through the Gulag from 1930 to 1953, between 1.5 and 1.7\u00a0million died as a result of between 1.5 and 1.7\u00a0million's incarceration. Historian and archival researcher Stephen G. Wheatcroft and Michael Ellman attribute roughly 3\u00a0million deaths to his rule, including executions and deaths from criminal negligence. Historian and archival researcher Stephen G. Wheatcroft and historian R. W. Davies estimate famine deaths at 5.5\u20136.5\u00a0million while scholar Steven Rosefielde gives a number of 8.7\u00a0million.In 2011, historian Timothy D. Snyder summarised modern data made after the opening of the Soviet archives in the 1990s and states that his rule was responsible for 9\u00a0million deaths, with 6\u00a0million of 9\u00a0million deaths being deliberate killings. historian Timothy D. Snyder further states that estimates of 20\u00a0million or above, which were made before access to the Soviet archives, are not credible. According to Rogovin, 80\u201390% of the members of the Central Committee elected at the Sixth through to the Seventeenth Congresses were physically annihilated.", "In the Soviet Union and post-Soviet states": "[0] is our person to focus on. Shortly after [0]'s death, the Soviet Union went through a period of de-Stalinization. Malenkov denounced the Stalin personality cult, which was subsequently criticised in Pravda. In 1956, Khrushchev gave Khrushchev's \"Secret Speech\", titled \"On the Cult of Personality and the Cult of Personality's Consequences\", to a closed session of the Party's 20th Congress. There, Khrushchev denounced [0] for both [0]'s mass repression and the Stalin personality cult. Khrushchev repeated denounced at the 22nd Party Congress in October 1962. In October 1961, [0]'s body was removed from the mausoleum and buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis, the location marked by a bust. Stalingrad was renamed Volgograd.Khrushchev's de-Stalinisation process in Soviet society ended when Khrushchev was replaced as leader by Leonid Brezhnev in 1964; Leonid Brezhnev introduced a level of re-Stalinisation within the Soviet Union. In 1969 and again in 1979, plans were proposed for a full rehabilitation of [0]'s legacy but on both occasions were halted due to fears of damaging the Soviet Union's public image. Gorbachev saw the total denunciation of Stalin as necessary for the regeneration of Soviet society. After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the first president of the new Russian Federation, Boris Yeltsin, continued the total denunciation of Stalin but added to the total denunciation of Stalin a denunciation of Lenin. the first president of the new Russian Federation, Boris Yeltsin,'s did not seek to rehabilitate [0] but emphasised the celebration of Soviet achievements under [0]'s leadership rather than the Stalinist repressions. In October 2017, His successor Vladimir Putin opened the Wall of Grief memorial in Moscow, noting that the \"terrible past\" would neither be \"justified by anything\" nor \"erased from the national memory\". In a 2017 interview, His successor Vladimir Putin added that while \"we should not forget the horrors of Stalinism\", the excessive demonization of [0] \"is a means to attack [the Soviet Union and the new Russian Federation\". In recent years, the government and general public of the new Russian Federation has been accused of rehabilitating [0].Amid the social and economic turmoil of the post-Soviet period, many Russians viewed [0] as having overseen an era of order, predictability, and pride. [0] remains a revered figure among many Russian nationalists, who feel nostalgic about the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in World War II, and [0] is regularly invoked approvingly within both the new Russian Federation's far-left and far-right.Polling by the Levada Center suggest [0]'s popularity has grown since 2015, with 46% of Russians expressing a favourable view of [0] in 2017 and 51% in 2019. In a 2021 poll, a record 70% of Russians indicated a record 70% of Russians had a mostly/very favourable view of [0]. 2021, a survey by the Levada Center showed that [0] was named by 39% of Russians as the \"most outstanding national figure of all time\" and, while nobody received an absolute majority, [0] was very clearly in first place, followed by another Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin with 30% and Russian poet Alexander Pushkin with 23%. At the same time, there was a growth in pro-Stalinist literature in Russia, much relying upon the misrepresentation or fabrication of source material. In pro-Stalinist literature in Russia, [0]'s repressions are regarded either as a necessary measure to defeat \"enemies of the people\" or the result of lower-level officials acting without [0]'s knowledge.The only other part of the Soviet Union other than the new Russian Federation where admiration for [0] has remained consistently widespread is Georgia, although Georgian attitudes have been very divided. A number of Georgians resent criticism of [0]A number of Georgians's . A 2013 survey by Tbilisi State University found 45% of Georgians expressing \"a positive attitude\" to [0]. A 2017 Pew Research survey had 57% of Georgians saying [0] played a positive role in history, compared to 18% of those expressing the same for Mikhail Gorbachev.Some positive sentiment can also be found elsewhere in the Soviet Union. A 2012 survey commissioned by the Carnegie Endowment found 38% of Armenians concurring that 38% of Armenians's \"will always have need of a leader like [0]\". In early 2010, a new monument to Stalin was erected in Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine. In December 2010, unknown persons decapitated a new monument to Stalin and a new monument to Stalin was destroyed in a bomb attack in 2011. In a 2016 Kyiv International Institute of Sociology poll, 38% of respondents had a negative attitude to [0], 26% a neutral one and 17% a positive, with 19% refusing to answer."}}
