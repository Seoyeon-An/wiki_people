[0] was born on 18 June 1942 at Walton Hospital in the Walton area of Liverpool, where his mother, Mary Patricia (n\u00e9e Mohin), had qualified to practise as a nurse. Both of his parents were of Irish descent. [0] has a younger brother, Peter Michael, and a younger stepsister, Ruth, born to his father Jim's second wife, Angie, during his father Jim's second wife, Angie,'s first marriage. Paul and Michael a younger brother, Peter Michael, were baptised in his mother, Mary Patricia (n\u00e9e Mohin),'s Catholic faith, even though his father Jim's was a former Protestant who had turned agnostic. Religion was not emphasised in the household.According to [0]'s biographer Peter Ames Carlin, Both of his parents came from the \"lowest rungs of the working class\" but had experienced some upward social mobility during Both of his parents's lifetimes. Before the war, his father Jim's had worked as a salesman for the cotton merchants A. Hannay and Co., having been promoted from his father Jim's's job as a sample boy in the cotton merchants A. Hannay and Co.'s warehouse; when the war broke out, the cotton merchants A. Hannay and Co.'s was shuttered, and his father Jim's was employed as a lathe turner at Napier's defence engineering works, volunteering for the fire brigade at night. The growing family was rehoused at a flat in Knowsley in 1944 and then in a council housing development in Speke in 1946. After the war, his father Jim's returned to his father Jim's's job at the cotton merchants A. Hannay and Co. with a reduced income. his mother, Mary Patricia (n\u00e9e Mohin),'s work as a visiting midwife was much more remunerative.[0] attended Stockton Wood Road Primary School in Speke from 1947 until 1949, when [0] transferred to Joseph Williams Junior School in Belle Vale because of overcrowding at Stockton Wood Road Primary School in Speke. In 1953, [0] was one of only three students out of 90 to pass the 11-Plus exam, meaning [0] could attend the Liverpool Institute, a grammar school rather than a secondary modern school. In 1954, [0] met schoolmate George Harrison on the bus from [0]'s suburban home in Speke. The two quickly became friends; [0] later admitted: \"[0] tended to talk down to schoolmate George Harrison because schoolmate George Harrison was a year younger.\"The type of people that [0] came from, [0] never saw better! [...] [0] mean, the Presidents, the Prime Minister, [0] never met anyone half as nice as some of the people I know from Liverpool who are nothing, who do nothing. some of the people I know from Liverpool who are nothing, who do nothing're not important or famous. But some of the people I know from Liverpool who are nothing, who do nothing are smart, like his father Jim's was smart. [0] mean, people who can just cut through problems like a hot knife through butter. The kind of people you need in life. Salt of the earth.\u2014 [0], Playboy interview, 1984Mary his mother, Mary Patricia (n\u00e9e Mohin),'s midwifery paid well, and  his mother, Mary Patricia (n\u00e9e Mohin),'s earnings enabled The growing family to move into 20\u00a0Forthlin Road in Allerton, where The growing family lived until 1964. his mother, Mary Patricia (n\u00e9e Mohin), rode a bicycle to his mother, Mary Patricia (n\u00e9e Mohin),'s patients; [0] described an early memory of his mother, Mary Patricia (n\u00e9e Mohin), leaving at \"about three in the morning [the] streets\u00a0... thick with snow\". On 31 October 1956, when [0] was 14, his mother, Mary Patricia (n\u00e9e Mohin), died of an embolism as a complication of surgery for breast cancer. [0]'s loss later became a connection with John Lennon, whose mother, Julia, died in 1958 when Lennon was 17.McCartney's father John Lennon, whose mother, Julia, died in 1958 when Lennon was 17.McCartney's father was a trumpet player and pianist who led Jim Mac's Jazz Band in the 1920s. his father Jim's kept an upright piano in the front room, encouraged his father Jim's's sons to be musical and advised [0] to take piano lessons. However, [0] preferred to learn by ear.[nb 1] When [0] was 11, his father Jim's encouraged [0] to audition for the Liverpool Cathedral choir, but [0] was not accepted. [0] then joined the choir at St Barnabas' Church, Mossley Hill. [0] received a nickel-plated trumpet from his father Jim's for [0]'s fourteenth birthday, but when rock and roll became popular on Radio Luxembourg, [0] traded a nickel-plated trumpet for a \u00a315 Framus Zenith (model\u00a017) acoustic guitar, since [0] wanted to be able to sing while playing. [0] found it difficult to play guitar right-handed, but after noticing a poster advertising a Slim Whitman concert and realising that Slim Whitman played left-handed, [0] reversed the order of the strings. [0] wrote [0]'s first song, \"I Lost My Little Girl\", on a \u00a315 Framus Zenith (model\u00a017) acoustic guitar, and composed another early tune that would become \"When I'm Sixty-Four\" on the piano. American rhythm and blues influenced [0], and Little Richard was [0]'s schoolboy idol; \"Long Tall Sally\" was the first song [0] performed in public, at a Butlin's Filey holiday camp talent competition."}, "Career": {"1957\u20131960: The Quarrymen": "[0] is our person to focus on. At the age of fifteen on 6 July 1957, [0] met John Lennon and his band, the Quarrymen, at the St Peter's Church Hall f\u00eate in Woolton. his band, the Quarrymen played a mix of rock and roll and skiffle, a type of popular music with jazz, blues and folk influences. Soon afterwards, the members of his band, the Quarrymen invited [0] to join as a rhythm guitarist, and [0] formed a close working relationship with John Lennon. Harrison joined in 1958 as lead guitarist, followed by John Lennon's art school friend Stuart Sutcliffe on bass, in 1960. By May 1960, his band, the Quarrymen had tried several names, including Johnny and the Moondogs, Beatals and the Silver Beetles. his band, the Quarrymen adopted the name the Beatles in August 1960 and recruited drummer Pete Best shortly before a five-engagement residency in Hamburg.", "1960\u20131970: The Beatles": "Paul McCartney is [0]'s person to focus on. In 1961, Sutcliffe left [0], and Paul McCartney became their bass player. It is disputed whether Paul McCartney did so reluctantly or actively sought out their bass player. While in Hamburg, [0] recorded professionally for the first time and were credited as the Beat Brothers, who were the backing band for English singer Tony Sheridan on the single \"My Bonnie\". This resulted in attention from Brian Epstein, who was a key figure in their subsequent development and success. Brian Epstein, who was a key figure in their subsequent development and success became [0]'s manager in January 1962. Ringo Starr replaced Best in August, and [0] had [0]'s first hit, \"Love Me Do\", in October, becoming popular in the UK in 1963, and in the US a year later. The fan hysteria became known as \"Beatlemania\", and the press sometimes referred to Paul McCartney as the \"cute Beatle\".[nb 2] Paul McCartney co-wrote (with Lennon) several of [0]'s early hits, including \"I Saw Her Standing There\", \"She Loves You\", \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" (1963) and \"Can't Buy Me Love\" (1964).In August 1965, [0] released the McCartney composition \"Yesterday\", featuring a string quartet. Included on the Help! LP, the McCartney composition \"Yesterday\", featuring a string quartet was [0]'s first recorded use of classical music elements and [0]'s first recording that involved only a single band member. the McCartney composition \"Yesterday\", featuring a string quartet became one of the most covered songs in popular music history. Later that year, during recording sessions for the album Rubber Soul, Paul McCartney began to supplant Lennon as the dominant musical force in [0]. Musicologist Ian MacDonald wrote, \"from \u00a0... [Paul McCartney] would be in the ascendant not only as a songwriter, but also as instrumentalist, arranger, producer, and de facto musical director of [0].\" Critics described the album Rubber Soul as a significant advance in the refinement and profundity of [0]'s music and lyrics. Considered a high point in the [0] catalogue, both Lennon and McCartney said both Lennon and McCartney had written the music for the song \"In My Life\". Paul McCartney said of the album Rubber Soul, \"[0]'d had [0]'s cute period, and now it was time to expand.\" Recording engineer Norman Smith stated that the Rubber Soul sessions exposed indications of increasing contention within [0]: \"the clash between Paul McCartney and Paul was becoming obvious\u00a0... [and] as far as Paul was concerned, George [Harrison] could do no right\u2014Paul was absolutely finicky.\"In 1965, [0] released the album Revolver. Featuring sophisticated lyrics, studio experimentation, and an expanded repertoire of musical genres ranging from innovative string arrangements to psychedelic rock, the album Revolver marked an artistic leap for [0]. The first of three consecutive Paul McCartney A-sides, the single \"Paperback Writer\" preceded the album Revolver's release. [0] produced a short promotional film for the song, and another for its B-side, \"Rain\". a short promotional film for the song, and another for its B-side, \"Rain\" aired on The Ed Sullivan Show and Top of the Pops in June 1966. the album Revolver also included McCartney's \"Eleanor Rigby\", which featured a string octet. According to Gould, McCartney's \"Eleanor Rigby\", which featured a string octet is \"a neoclassical tour de force ... a true hybrid, conforming to no recognizable style or genre of song\". Except for some backing vocals, McCartney's \"Eleanor Rigby\", which featured a string octet included only Paul McCartney's lead vocal and the strings arranged by producer George Martin.[nb 3]The band gave [0]'s final commercial concert at the end of [0]'s 1965 US tour. Later that year, Paul McCartney completed Paul McCartney's first musical project independent of [0]\u2014a film score for the UK production The Family Way. a film score for the UK production The Family Way was a collaboration with Martin, who used two McCartney themes to write thirteen variations. a film score for the UK production The Family Way failed to chart, but a film score for the UK production The Family Way won Paul McCartney an Ivor Novello Award for Best Instrumental Theme.Upon the end of [0]'s performing career, Paul McCartney sensed unease in [0] and wanted [0] to maintain creative productivity. Paul McCartney pressed [0] to start a new project, which became Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, widely regarded as rock's first concept album. Paul McCartney was inspired to create a new persona for [0], to serve as a vehicle for experimentation and to demonstrate to [0]'s fans that [0] had musically matured. Paul McCartney invented the fictional band of the album's's title track. As Paul McCartney explained, \"[0] were fed up with being [0]. [0] really hated that fucking four little mop-top approach. [0] were not boys [0] were men\u00a0... and [[0]] thought of [0] as artists rather than just performers.\"Starting in November 1966, [0] adopted an experimental attitude during recording sessions for the album. [0]'s recording of the song \"In My Life\" required a forty-piece orchestra, which Martin, who used two McCartney themes to write thirteen variations and Paul McCartney took turns conducting. recording sessions for the album produced the double A-side single \"Strawberry Fields Forever\"/\"Penny Lane\" in February 1967, and the album Revolver followed in June.[nb 4] Based on an ink drawing by Paul McCartney, the LP's cover included a collage designed by pop artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth, featuring the Beatles in costume as the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, standing with a host of celebrities. the LP's cover piqued a frenzy of analysis.After Brian died\u00a0... Paul took over and supposedly led [0] you know\u00a0... [0] went round in circles\u00a0... [0] broke up then. That was the disintegration. Lennon thought, '[0]'ve fuckin' had it.'\u2014 Lennon, Rolling Stone magazine, Brian's death in August 1967 created a void, which left the Beatles perplexed and concerned about their future. Paul McCartney stepped in to fill a void, which left the Beatles perplexed and concerned about their future and gradually became the de facto leader and business manager of [0]Lennon . In Paul McCartney's first creative suggestion after this change of leadership, Paul McCartney proposed that [0] move forward on their plans to produce a film for television, which was to become Magical Mystery Tour. According to [0] historian Mark Lewisohn, their plans to produce a film for television, which was to become Magical Mystery Tour was \"an administrative nightmare throughout\". Paul McCartney largely directed a film for television, which was to become Magical Mystery Tour. However, a film for television, which was to become Magical Mystery Tour's soundtrack was more successful. a film for television, which was to become Magical Mystery Tour was released in the UK as a six-track double extended play disc (EP) and as the album Revolver in the US, filled out with five songs from [0]'s recent singles. the album Revolver the album Revolver achieved $8\u00a0million in sales within three weeks of a film for television, which was to become Magical Mystery Tour's release, higher initial sales than any other Capitol LP up to that point.The Beatles' animated film Yellow Submarine, loosely based on the imaginary world evoked by McCartney's 1966 composition, premiered in July 1968. Though critics admired The Beatles' animated film Yellow Submarine, loosely based on the imaginary world evoked by McCartney's 1966 composition, for The Beatles' animated film Yellow Submarine, loosely based on the imaginary world evoked by McCartney's 1966 composition,'s visual style, humour and music, the soundtrack album issued six months later received a less enthusiastic response. By late 1968, relations within [0] were deteriorating. The tension grew during the recording of [0]'s eponymous double album, also known as the \"White Album\".[nb 5] Matters worsened the following year during the Let It Be sessions, when a camera crew filmed Paul McCartney lecturing [0]: \"[0]'ve been very negative since Mr. Epstein passed away\u00a0... [0] were always fighting [his] discipline a bit, but it's silly to fight [his] discipline if [his] discipline's [0]'s own\".In March 1969, Paul McCartney married Paul McCartney's first wife, Linda Eastman, and in August, the couple had the couple's first child, Mary, named after Paul McCartney's late mother. Abbey Road was [0]'s last recorded album, and Martin, who used two McCartney themes to write thirteen variations suggested \"a continuously moving piece of music\", urging [0] to think symphonically. Paul McCartney agreed, but Lennon did not. [0] eventually compromised, agreeing to Paul McCartney's suggestion: an LP featuring individual songs on side one and a long medley on side two. In October 1969, a rumour surfaced that Paul McCartney had died in a car crash in 1965 and was replaced by a lookalike, but a rumour was quickly refuted when a November Life magazine cover featured Paul McCartney and Paul McCartney's family, accompanied by the caption \"Paul is still with us\".Lennon privately left [0] in September 1969, though agreed not to go public with the information to not jeopardise ongoing business negotiations. Paul McCartney was in the midst of business disagreements with Paul McCartney's bandmates, largely concerning Allen Klein's's management of [0], when Paul McCartney announced Paul McCartney's own departure from [0] on 10 April 1970. Paul McCartney filed a suit for [0]'s formal dissolution on 31 December 1970, and in March 1971 the court appointed a receiver to oversee the finances of [0]'s company Apple Corps. An English court legally dissolved [0]'s partnership on 9 January 1975, though sporadic lawsuits against [0]'s record company EMI, Allen Klein's, and each other persisted until 1989.[nb 6][nb 7]", "1970\u20131981: Wings": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] didn't really want to keep going as a solo artist\u00a0... so it became obvious that [0] had to get a band together\u00a0... Linda and I talked it through and it was like, \"Yeah, but letLinda and I not put together a supergroup, letLinda and I go back to square one.\"\u2014 [0] the Beatles were breaking up in 1969\u201370, [0] fell into a depression. [0]'s helped [0] pull out of a depression by praising [0]'s work as a songwriter and convincing [0] to continue writing and recording. In Linda's honour, [0] wrote \"Maybe [0]'m Amazed\", explaining that with the Beatles breaking up, \"that was [0]'s feeling: Maybe [0]'m amazed at what's going on ... Maybe [0]'m a man and maybe Linda're the only woman who could ever help [0]; Baby won't Linda help [0] understand ... Maybe [0]'m amazed at the way Linda pulled [0] out of time, hung [0] on the line, Maybe [0]'m amazed at the way [0] really need Linda.\" [0] added that \"every love song [0] write is for Linda.\"In 1970, [0] continued [0]'s musical career with his first solo release, McCartney, a US number-one album. Apart from some vocal contributions from Linda, his first solo release, McCartney, a US number-one album is a one-man album, with [0] providing compositions, instrumentation and vocals.[nb 8] In 1971, [0] collaborated with Linda and drummer Denny Seiwell on a second album, Ram. A UK number one and a US top five, a second album, Ram included the co-written US number-one hit single \"Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey\". Later that year, ex-Moody Blues guitarist Denny Laine joined the McCartneys and Seiwell to form the band Wings. [0] had this to say on the band Wings's formation: \"the band Wings were always a difficult idea\u00a0... any group having to follow [the Beatles's] success would have a hard job\u00a0... [0] found [0] in that very position. However, it was a choice between going on or finishing, and [0] loved music too much to think of stopping.\"[nb 9] In September 1971, the McCartneys's daughter Stella was born, named in honour of Linda's grandmothers, both of whom were named Stella.Following the addition of guitarist Henry McCullough, Wings' first concert tour began in 1972 with a debut performance in front of an audience of seven hundred at the University of Nottingham. Ten more gigs followed as the band Wings travelled across the UK in a van during an unannounced tour of universities, during which the band Wings stayed in modest accommodation and received pay in coinage collected from students, while avoiding Beatles songs during the band Wings's performances. [0] later said, \"The main thing [0] didn't want was to come on stage, faced with the whole torment of five rows of press people with little pads, all looking at [0] and saying, 'Oh well, he is not as good as he was.' So the band Wings decided to go out on Wings' first concert tour\u00a0... by the end of Wings' first concert tour [0] felt ready for something else, so the band Wings went into Europe.\" During the seven-week, 25-show Wings Over Europe Tour, the band Wings played almost solely the band Wings and [0] solo material: the Little Richard cover \"Long Tall Sally\" was the only song that the Beatles had previously recorded. [0] wanted the seven-week, 25-show Wings Over Europe Tour to avoid large venues; most of the small halls the band Wings played had capacities of fewer than 3,000 people.In March 1973, the band Wings achieved the band Wings's first US number-one single, \"My Love\", included on the band Wings's second LP, Red Rose Speedway, a US number one and UK top five.[nb 10] [0]'s collaboration with Linda and former Beatles producer Martin resulted in the song \"Live and Let Die\", which was the theme song for the James Bond film of the same name. Nominated for an Academy Award, the song \"Live and Let Die\", which was the theme song for the James Bond film of the same name reached number two in US and number nine in the UK. the song \"Live and Let Die\", which was the theme song for the James Bond film of the same name also earned former Beatles producer Martin a Grammy for former Beatles producer Martin's orchestral arrangement. Music professor and author Vincent Benitez described the song \"Live and Let Die\", which was the theme song for the James Bond film of the same name as \"symphonic rock at its best\".[nb 11]After the departure of McCullough and Seiwell in 1973, the McCartneys and Seiwell recorded Band on the Run. The album was the first of seven platinum the band Wings LPs. The album was a US and the UK number one, the band Wings's first to top the charts in both countries and the first ever to reach Billboard magazine's charts on three separate occasions. One of the best-selling releases of the decade, The album remained on the UK charts for 124 weeks.

On \"Call Me Back Again\", according to Benitez, \"[0] shines as a bluesy solo vocalist\", while MacDonald called \"I'm Down\" \"a rock-and-roll classic\" that \"illustrates [0]'s vocal and stylistic versatility\". MacDonald described \"Helter Skelter\" as an early attempt at heavy metal, and \"Hey Jude\" as a \"pop/rock hybrid\", pointing out [0]'s \"use of gospel-style melismas\" in \"Hey Jude\" and [0]'s \"pseudo-soul shrieking in the fade-out\". Benitez identified \"Hope of Deliverance\" and \"Put It There\" as examples of [0]'s folk music efforts while musicologist Walter Everett considered \"When I'm Sixty-Four\" and \"Honey Pie\" attempts at vaudeville. MacDonald praised the \"swinging beat\" of the Beatles''s twenty-four bar blues song, \"She's a Woman\" as \"the most extreme sound the Beatles' had manufactured to date\", with [0]'s voice \"at the edge, squeezed to the upper limit of [0]'s chest register and threatening to crack at any moment.\" MacDonald described \"I've Got a Feeling\" as a \"raunchy, mid-tempo rocker\" with a \"robust and soulful\" vocal performance and \"Back in the U.S.S.R.\" as \"the last of the Beatles''sthe Beatles''s] up-tempo rockers\", [0]'s \"belting\" vocals among [0]'s best since \"Drive My Car\", recorded three years earlier.[0] also teasingly tried out classical singing, namely singing various renditions of \"Besame Mucho\" with the Beatles'.
