{"summary": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] (16 April 1889\u00a0\u2013 25 December 1977) was an English comic actor, filmmaker, and composer who rose to fame in the era of silent film. [0] became a worldwide icon through his screen persona, the Tramp, and is considered one of the film industry's's most important figures. [0]'s career spanned more than 75 years, from childhood in the Victorian era until a year before [0]'s death in 1977, and encompassed both adulation and controversy.[0]'s childhood in London was one of poverty and hardship. [0]'s father was absent and [0]'s struggled financially\u00a0\u2013 [0] was sent to a workhouse twice before the age of nine. When [0] was 14, [0]'s was committed to a mental asylum. [0] began performing at an early age, touring music halls and later working as a stage actor and comedian. At 19, [0] was signed to the Fred Karno company, which took [0] to the United States. [0] was scouted for the film industry's and began appearing in 1914 for Keystone Studios. [0] soon developed his screen persona, the Tramp and attracted a large fan base. [0] directed [0]'s own films and continued to hone [0]'s craft as [0] moved to the Essanay, Mutual, and First National corporations. By 1918, [0] was one of the world's best-known figures.In 1919, [0] co-founded distribution company United Artists, which gave [0] complete control over [0]'s films. [0]'s first feature-length film was The Kid (1921), followed by A Woman of Paris (1923), The Gold Rush (1925), and The Circus (1928). [0] initially refused to move to sound films in the 1930s, instead producing City Lights (1931) and Modern Times (1936) without dialogue. [0]'s first sound film was The Great Dictator (1940), which satirised Adolf Hitler. The 1940s were marked with controversy for [0], and [0]'s popularity declined rapidly. [0] was accused of communist sympathies, and some members of the press and public were scandalised by [0]'s involvement in a paternity suit and marriages to much younger women. An FBI investigation was opened, and [0] was forced to leave the United States and settle in Switzerland. [0] abandoned his screen persona, the Tramp in [0]'s later films, which include Monsieur Verdoux (1947), Limelight (1952), A King in New York (1957), and A Countess from Hong Kong ([0] wrote, directed, produced, edited, starred in, and composed the music for most of [0]'s . [0] was a perfectionist, and [0]'s financial independence enabled [0] to spend years on the development and production of a picture. [0]'s are characterised by slapstick combined with pathos, typified in the Tramp's struggles against adversity. Many contain social and political themes, as well as autobiographical elements. [0] received an Honorary Academy Award for \"the incalculable effect [0] has had in making motion pictures the art form of this century\" in 1972, as part of a renewed appreciation for [0]'s work. [0] continues to be held in high regard, with The Gold Rush, City Lights, Modern Times, and The Great Dictator often ranked on lists of the greatest films."}, "Biography": {"1889\u20131913: early years": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was born on 16 April 1889 to Hannah Chaplin (n\u00e9e Hill) and Charles Chaplin Sr. [0]'s paternal grandmother came from the Smith family, who belonged to Romani people. There is no official record of [0]'s , although [0] believed [0] was born at East Street, Walworth, in South London. Hannah Chaplin (n\u00e9e Hill) and Charles Chaplin Sr had married four years previously, at which time Charles Chaplin Sr became the legal guardian of Hannah Chaplin (n\u00e9e Hill)'s first son, Sydney John Hill. At the time of [0]'s , Hannah Chaplin (n\u00e9e Hill) and Charles Chaplin Sr were both music hall entertainers. Hannah Chaplin (n\u00e9e Hill) had a brief and unsuccessful career under the stage name Lily Harley, while Charles Chaplin Sr was a popular singer. Although Hannah Chaplin (n\u00e9e Hill) and Charles Chaplin Sr never divorced, Hannah Chaplin (n\u00e9e Hill) and Charles Chaplin Sr were estranged by around 1891. The following year, Hannah Chaplin (n\u00e9e Hill) gave birth to a third son, George Wheeler Dryden, fathered by the music hall entertainer Leo Dryden. a third son, George Wheeler Dryden, fathered by the music hall entertainer Leo Dryden was taken by the music hall entertainer Leo Dryden at six months old, and did not re-enter [0]'s life for thirty years.[0]'s childhood was fraught with poverty and hardship, making [0]'s eventual trajectory \"the most dramatic of all the rags to riches stories ever told\" according to [0]'s authorised biographer David Robinson. [0]'s early years were spent with Hannah Chaplin (n\u00e9e Hill) in the London district of Kennington. Hannah Chaplin (n\u00e9e Hill) had no means of income, other than occasional nursing and dressmaking, and Charles Chaplin Sr provided no financial support. As the situation deteriorated, [0] was sent to Lambeth Workhouse when [0] was seven years old. The council housed [0] at the Central London District School for paupers, which [0] remembered as \"a forlorn existence\". [0] was briefly reunited with Hannah Chaplin (n\u00e9e Hill) 18 months later, but Hannah Chaplin (n\u00e9e Hill) was forced to readmit Hannah Chaplin (n\u00e9e Hill)'s to Lambeth Workhouse in July 1898. The boys were promptly sent to Norwood Schools, another institution for destitute children.[0] was hardly aware of a crisis because his mother and brother Sydney lived in a continual crisis; and, being a boy, [0] dismissed his mother and brother Sydney's troubles with gracious forgetfulness. In September 1898, Hannah Chaplin (n\u00e9e Hill) was committed to Cane Hill mental asylum; Hannah Chaplin (n\u00e9e Hill) had developed a psychosis seemingly brought on by an infection of syphilis and malnutrition. For the two months Hannah Chaplin (n\u00e9e Hill) was there, [0] [0]'s were sent to live with their father, whom the young boys scarcely knew. their father, whom the young boys scarcely knew was by then severely alcoholic, and life there was bad enough to provoke a visit from the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. their father, whom the young boys scarcely knew died two years later, at 38 years old, from cirrhosis of the liver.Hannah Chaplin (n\u00e9e Hill) entered a period of remission but, in May 1903, became ill again. [0] had the task of taking Hannah Chaplin (n\u00e9e Hill) to the infirmary, from where Hannah Chaplin (n\u00e9e Hill) was sent back to Cane Hill mental asylum. [0] lived alone for several days, searching for food and occasionally sleeping rough, until brother Sydney\u2013 returned. Hannah Chaplin (n\u00e9e Hill) was released from Cane Hill mental asylum eight months later, but in March 1905, Hannah Chaplin (n\u00e9e Hill)'s illness returned, this time permanently. \"There was nothing his mother and brother Sydney could do but accept Hannah Chaplin (n\u00e9e Hill)'s fate\", [0] later wrote, and Hannah Chaplin (n\u00e9e Hill) remained in care until Hannah Chaplin (n\u00e9e Hill)'s death in 1928.Between [0]'s time in the poor schools and Hannah Chaplin (n\u00e9e Hill) succumbing to mental illness, [0] began to perform on stage. [0] later recalled making his first amateur appearance at the age of five years, when [0] took over from Hannah Chaplin (n\u00e9e Hill) one night in Aldershot. his first amateur appearance was an isolated occurrence, but by the time [0] was nine [0] had, with Hannah Chaplin (n\u00e9e Hill)'s encouragement, grown interested in performing. [0] later wrote: \"[Hannah Chaplin (n\u00e9e Hill)] imbued [0] with the feeling that [0] had some sort of talent\". Through their father, whom the young boys scarcely knew's connections, [0] became a member of the Eight Lancashire Lads clog-dancing troupe, with whom he toured English music halls throughout 1899 and 1900. [0] worked hard, and the act was popular with audiences, but [0] was not satisfied with dancing and wished to form a comedy act.In the years [0] was touring with the Eight Lancashire Lads clog-dancing troupe, with whom he toured English music halls throughout 1899 and 1900, Hannah Chaplin (n\u00e9e Hill) ensured that [0] still attended school but, by the age of 13, [0] had abandoned education. [0] supported [0] with a range of jobs, while nursing [0]'s ambition to become an actor. At 14, shortly after Hannah Chaplin (n\u00e9e Hill)'s relapse, [0] registered with a theatrical agency in London's West End. The manager sensed potential in Chaplin, who was promptly given [0]'s first role as a newsboy in Harry Arthur Saintsbury's Jim, a Romance of Cockayne. Harry Arthur Saintsbury's Jim, a Romance of Cockayne opened in July 1903, but Harry Arthur Saintsbury's Jim, a Romance of Cockayne was unsuccessful and closed after two weeks. [0]'s comic performance, however, was singled out for praise in many of the reviews.Harry Arthur Saintsbury's secured a role for [0] in Charles Frohman's production of Sherlock Holmes, where [0] played Billy the pageboy in three nationwide tours. [0]'s performance was so well received that [0] was called to London to play Billy the pageboy alongside William Gillette, the original Holmes. \"play was like tidings from heaven\", [0] recalled. At 16 years old, [0] starred in Sherlock Holmes's West End production at the Duke of York's Theatre from October to December 1905. [0] completed one final tour of Sherlock Holmes in early 1906, before leaving Sherlock Holmes after more than two-and-a-half years.[0] soon found work with a new company and went on tour with [0]'s brother, who was also pursuing an acting career, in a comedy sketch called Repairs. In May 1906, [0] joined the juvenile act Casey's Circus, where [0] developed popular burlesque pieces and was soon the star of the show. By the time the show finished touring in July 1907, [0] had become an accomplished comedic performer. [0] struggled to find more work, however, and a brief attempt at a solo act was a failure.Meanwhile, [0] had joined Fred Karno's prestigious comedy company in 1906 and, by 1908, [0] was one of Fred Karno's prestigious comedy company's key performers. In February, [0] managed to secure a two-week trial for [0]'s . Fred Karno's was initially wary, and considered [0] a \"pale, puny, sullen-looking youngster\" who \"looked much too shy to do any good in the theatre\". However, [0] made an impact on [0]'s first night at the London Coliseum and [0] was quickly signed to a contract. [0] began by playing a series of minor parts, eventually progressing to starring roles in 1909. In April 1910, [0] was given the lead in a new sketch, Jimmy the Fearless. a new sketch, Jimmy the Fearless was a big success, and [0] received considerable press attention.Fred Karno's selected Fred Karno's's to join the section of the company, one that also included Stan Laurel, that toured North America's vaudeville circuit. [0] headed the section of the company, one that also included Stan Laurel, that toured North America's vaudeville circuit and impressed reviewers, being described as \"one of the best pantomime artists ever seen here\". [0]'s most successful role was a drunk called the \"Inebriate Swell\", which drew [0] significant recognition. toured lasted 21 months, and the section of the company, one that also included Stan Laurel, that toured North America's vaudeville circuit returned to England in June 1912. [0] recalled that [0] \"had a disquieting feeling of sinking back into a depressing commonplaceness\" and was, therefore, delighted when a new tour began in October.", "1914\u20131917: entering films": "[0] is our person to focus on. Six months into the second American tour, [0] was invited to join the New York Motion Picture Company. A representative who had seen [0]'s performances thought [0] could replace Fred Mace, a star of the New York Motion Picture Company's Keystone Studios who intended to leave. [0] thought the Keystone comedies \"a crude m\u00e9lange of rough and rumble\", but liked the idea of working in films and rationalised: \"Besides, working would mean a new life.\" [0] met with the New York Motion Picture Company and signed a $150-per-week contract in September 1913. [0] arrived in Los Angeles in early December, and began working for Keystone on 5\u00a0January [0]'s boss was Mack Sennett, who initially expressed concern that the 24-year-old looked too young. [0] was not used in a picture until late January, during which time [0] attempted to learn the processes of filmmaking. The one-reeler Making a Living marked [0]'s film acting debut and was released on 2\u00a0February 1914. [0] strongly disliked The one-reeler Making a Living, but one review picked [0] out as \"a comedian of the first water\". For [0]'s second appearance in front of the camera, [0] selected the costume with which [0] became identified. [0] described the process in [0]'s autobiography:[0] wanted everything to be a contradiction: the pants baggy, the coat tight, the hat small and the shoes large\u00a0... [0] added a small moustache, which, [0] reasoned, would add age without hiding [0]'s expression. [0] had no idea of the character. But the moment [0] was dressed, the clothes and the makeup made [0] feel the person the character was. [0] began to know the character, and by the time [0] walked on stage the character was fully born. The one-reeler Making a Living was Mabel's Strange Predicament, but \"the Tramp\" character, as the character became known, debuted to audiences in Kid Auto Races at Venice\u00a0\u2013 shot later than Mabel's Strange Predicament but released two days earlier on 7\u00a0February 1914. [0] adopted the character as [0]'s screen persona and attempted to make suggestions for the films he appeared in. suggestions for the films he appeared in were dismissed by [0]'s directors. During the filming of [0]'s 11th picture, Mabel at the Wheel, [0] clashed with director Mabel Normand and was almost released from a $150-per-week contract. Mack Sennett, who initially expressed concern that the 24-year-old looked too young kept [0] on, however, when Mack Sennett, who initially expressed concern that the 24-year-old looked too young received orders from exhibitors for more [0] films. Mack Sennett, who initially expressed concern that the 24-year-old looked too young also allowed [0] to direct his next film [0] after [0] promised to pay $1,500 ($44,000 in 2022 dollars) if his next film was unsuccessful.Caught in the Rain, issued 4\u00a0May 1914, was [0]'s directorial debut and was highly successful. Thereafter [0] directed almost every short film in which [0] appeared for Keystone, at the rate of approximately one per week, a period which [0] later remembered as the most exciting time of [0]'s . [0]'s films introduced a slower form of comedy than the typical Keystone farce, and [0] developed a large fan base. In November 1914, [0] had a supporting role in the first feature length comedy film, Tillie's Punctured Romance, directed by Mack Sennett, who initially expressed concern that the 24-year-old looked too young and starring Marie Dressler, which was a commercial success and increased [0]'s popularity. When a $150-per-week contract came up for renewal at the end of 1914, [0] asked for $1,000 a week, an amount Mack Sennett, who initially expressed concern that the 24-year-old looked too young refused as Mack Sennett, who initially expressed concern that the 24-year-old looked too young thought $1,000 a week was too large.The Essanay Film Manufacturing Company of Chicago sent [0] an offer of $1,250 a week with a signing bonus of $10,000. [0] joined The Essanay Film Manufacturing Company of Chicago in late December 1914, where [0] began forming a stock company of regular players, actors [0] worked with again and again, including Ben Turpin, Leo White, Bud Jamison, Paddy McGuire, Fred Goodwins, and Billy Armstrong. [0] soon recruited a leading lady, Edna Purviance, whom Chaplin met in a caf\u00e9 and hired on account of her beautya leading lady, Edna Purviance, whom Chaplin met in a caf\u00e9 and hired on account of her beauty's . a leading lady, Edna Purviance, whom Chaplin met in a caf\u00e9 and hired on account of her beauty went on to appear in 35 films with [0] over eight years; the pair also formed a romantic relationship that lasted until [0] asserted a high level of control over [0]'s pictures and started to put more time and care into each film. There was a month-long interval between the release of [0]'s second production, A Night Out, and [0]'s third, The Champion. The final seven of [0]'s 14 The Essanay Film Manufacturing Company of Chicago films were all produced at this slower pace. [0] also began to alter [0]'s screen persona, which had attracted some criticism at Keystone for its \"mean, crude, and brutish\" nature. the character became more gentle and romantic; The Tramp (April 1915) was considered a particular turning point in the character's development. The use of pathos was developed further with The Bank, in which [0] created a sad ending. Robinson notes that this was an innovation in comedy films, and marked the time when serious critics began to appreciate [0]'s work. At The Essanay Film Manufacturing Company of Chicago, writes film scholar Simon Louvish, [0] \"found the themes and the settings that would define the character's world\".During 1914, [0] became a cultural phenomenon. Shops were stocked with [0] merchandise, [0] was featured in cartoons and comic strips, and several songs were written about [0]. In July, a journalist for Motion Picture Magazine wrote that \"Chaplinitis\" had spread across America. As [0]'s fame grew worldwide, [0] became the film industry's first international star. When the The Essanay Film Manufacturing Company of Chicago contract ended in December 1915, [0], fully aware of [0]'s popularity, requested a $150,000 signing bonus from [0]'s next studio. [0] received several offers, including Universal, Fox, and Vitagraph, the best of which came from the Mutual Film Corporation at $10,000 a week.A contract was negotiated with the Mutual Film Corporation that amounted to $670,000 a year, which Robinson says made Chaplin\u00a0\u2013 at 26 years old\u00a0\u2013 one of the highest-paid people in the world. $670,000 a year shocked the public and was widely reported in the press. John R. Freuler, the studio president, explained: \"the Mutual Film Corporation can afford to pay $670,000 a year $670,000 a year annually because the public wants [0] and will pay for [0].the Mutual Film Corporation gave [0] [0]'s own Los Angeles studio to work in, which opened in March 1916. [0] added two key members to [0]'s stock company, Albert Austin and Eric Campbell, and produced a series of elaborate two-reelers: The Floorwalker, The Fireman, The Vagabond, One A.M., and The Count. For The Pawnshop, [0] recruited the actor Henry Bergman, who was to work with [0] for 30 years. Behind the Screen and The Rink completed [0]'s releases for 1916. The Mutual contract the Mutual Film Corporation stipulated that [0] release a two-reel film every four weeks, which [0] had managed to achieve. With the new year, however, [0] began to demand more time. [0] made only four more films for Mutual over the first ten months of 1916: Easy Street, The Cure, The Immigrant, and The Adventurer. With only four more films for Mutual's careful construction, only four more films for Mutual are considered by [0] scholars to be among [0]'s finest work. Later in life, [0] referred to [0]'s Mutual years as the happiest period of [0]'s . However, [0] also felt that only four more films for Mutual became increasingly formulaic over the period of The Mutual contract, and [0] was increasingly dissatisfied with the working conditions encouraging that.[0] was attacked in the British media for not fighting in the First World War. [0] defended [0], claiming that [0] would fight for Vitagraph if called and had registered for the American draft, but [0] was not summoned by either country. Despite attacked, [0] was a favourite with the troops, and [0]'s popularity continued to grow worldwide. Harper's Weekly reported that the name of [0] was \"a part of the common language of almost every country\", and that the Tramp image was \"universally familiar\". In 1916, professional [0] imitators were so widespread that [0] took legal action, and it was reported that nine out of ten men who attended costume parties, did so dressed as the character. 1916, a study by the Boston Society for Psychical Research concluded that [0] was \"an American obsession\". The actress Minnie Maddern Fiske wrote that \"a constantly increasing body of cultured, artistic people are beginning to regard [0], as an extraordinary artist, as well as a comic genius\".", "1918\u20131922: First National": "[0] is our person to focus on. In January 1918, [0] was visited by leading British singer and comedian Harry Lauder, and the two acted in a short film together.Mutual was patient with [0]'s decreased rate of output, and the contract ended amicably. With [0]'s aforementioned concern about the declining quality of [0]'s films because of contract scheduling stipulations, [0]'s primary concern in finding a new distributor was independence; Sydney Chaplin, then [0]'s business manager, told the press, \"[0] [must] be allowed all the time [0] needs and all the money for producing [films] the way [0] wants\u00a0... It is quality, not quantity, we are after.\" In June 1917, [0] signed to complete eight films for First National Exhibitors' Circuit in return for $1\u00a0million. [0] chose to build his own studio, situated on five acres of land off Sunset Boulevard, with production facilities of the highest order. his own studio, situated on five acres of land off Sunset Boulevard, with production facilities of the highest order was completed in January 1918, and [0] was given freedom over the making of [0]'s pictures.A Dog's Life, released April 1918, was the first film under the new contract. In A Dog's Life, released April 1918,, [0] demonstrated [0]'s increasing concern with story construction and [0]'s treatment of the Tramp as \"a sort of Pierrot\". A Dog's Life, released April 1918, was described by Louis Delluc as \"cinema's first total work of art\". [0] then embarked on the Third Liberty Bond campaign, touring the United States for one month to raise money for the Allies of the First World War. [0] also produced a short propaganda film at [0]'s own expense, donated to the government for fund-raising, called The Bond. [0]'s next release was war-based, placing the Tramp in the trenches for Shoulder Arms. Associates warned [0] against making a comedy about the First World War but, as [0] later recalled: \"Dangerous or not, the idea excited [0].\" [0] spent four months filming the picture, which was released in October 1918 with great success.After the release of Shoulder Arms, [0] requested more money from First National Exhibitors' Circuit, which was refused. Frustrated with First National Exhibitors' Circuit's lack of concern for quality, and worried about rumours of a possible merger between First National Exhibitors' Circuit and Famous Players\u2013Lasky, [0] joined forces with Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford, and D. W. Griffith to form a new distribution company, United Artists, in January 1919. The arrangement was revolutionary in the film industry, as The arrangement enabled the four partners\u00a0\u2013 all creative artists\u00a0\u2013 to personally fund the four partners\u00a0\u2013 all creative artists's pictures and have complete control. [0] was eager to start with a new distribution company, United Artists, and offered to buy out [0]'s contract with First National Exhibitors' Circuit. First National Exhibitors' Circuit refused and insisted that [0] complete the final six films owed.Before forma new distribution company, United Artists,, [0] married for the first time. The 16-year-old actress Mildred Harris had revealed that The 16-year-old actress Mildred Harris was pregnant with [0]'s child, and in September 1918, [0] married The 16-year-old actress Mildred Harris quietly in Los Angeles to avoid controversy. Soon after, the pregnancy was found to be false. [0] was unhappy with married and, feeling that marriage stunted [0]'s creativity, struggled over the production of [0]'s film Sunnyside. The 16-year-old actress Mildred Harris was by then legitimately pregnant, and on 7\u00a0July 1919, gave birth to a son. a son was born malformed and died three days later. married ended in April 1920, with [0] explaining in [0]'s autobiography that married were \"irreconcilably mismated\".Losing a son, plus [0]'s own childhood experiences, are thought to have influenced Chaplin's next film, which turned the Tramp into the caretaker of a young boy. For Chaplin's next film, which turned the Tramp into the caretaker of a young boy, [0] also wished to do more than comedy and, according to Louis Delluc, \"make [0]'s mark on a changed world\". Filming on Chaplin's next film, which turned the Tramp into the caretaker of a young boy began in August 1919, with four-year-old Jackie Coogan [0]'s co-star. Chaplin's next film, which turned the Tramp into the caretaker of a young boy was in production for nine months until May 1920 and, at 68 minutes, Chaplin's next film, which turned the Tramp into the caretaker of a young boy was [0]'s longest picture to date. Dealing with issues of poverty and parent\u2013child separation, Chaplin's next film, which turned the Tramp into the caretaker of a young boy was one of the earliest films to combine comedy and drama. Chaplin's next film, which turned the Tramp into the caretaker of a young boy was released in January 1921 with instant success, and, by 1924, had been screened in over 50 countries.[0] spent five months on his next film, the two-reeler The Idle Class. Work on his next film, the two-reeler The Idle Class was for a time delayed by more turmoil in [0]'s personal life. First National Exhibitors' Circuit had on 12 April announced [0]'s engagement to the actress May Collins, whom he had hired to be his secretary at the studio. By early June, however, [0] \"suddenly decided [0] could scarcely stand to be in the same room\" as the actress May Collins, whom he had hired to be his secretary at the studio, but instead of breaking off the engagement directly, [0] \"stopped coming in to work, sending word that [0] was suffering from a bad case of influenza, which May knew to be a lie.\"Ultimately work on his next film, the two-reeler The Idle Class resumed, and following his next film, the two-reeler The Idle Class's September 1921 release, [0] chose to return to England for the first time in almost a decade. [0] wrote a book about [0]'s journey, titled My Wonderful Visit. [0] then worked to fulfil [0]'s First National contract, releasing Pay Day in February 1922. The Pilgrim, [0]'s final short film, was delayed by distribution disagreements with First National Exhibitors' Circuit and released a year later.", "1923\u20131938: silent features": "[0] is our person to focus on. Having fulfilled [0]'s First National contract, [0] was free to make [0]'s first picture as an independent producer. In November 1922, [0] began filming A Woman of Paris, a romantic drama about ill-fated lovers. [0] intended A Woman of Paris, a romantic drama about ill-fated lovers to be a star-making vehicle for Edna Purviance, and did not appear in A Woman of Paris, a romantic drama about ill-fated lovers [0] other than in a brief, uncredited cameo. [0] wished A Woman of Paris, a romantic drama about ill-fated lovers to have a realistic feel and directed [0]'s cast to give restrained performances. In real life, [0] explained, \"men and women try to hide men and women's rather than seek to express their emotions\". A Woman of Paris, a romantic drama about ill-fated lovers premiered in September 1923 and was acclaimed for A Woman of Paris, a romantic drama about ill-fated lovers's innovative, subtle approach. The public, however, seemed to have little interest in a [0] film without [0], and A Woman of Paris, a romantic drama about ill-fated lovers was a box office disappointment. [0] was hurt by this failure\u00a0\u2013 [0] had long wanted to produce a dramatic film and was proud of the result\u00a0\u2013 and soon withdrew A Woman of Paris, a romantic drama about ill-fated lovers from circulation.[0] returned to comedy for his next project. Setting [0]'s standards high, [0] told [0] \"his next project must be an epic! The Greatest!\" Inspired by a photograph of the 1898 Klondike Gold Rush, and later the story of the Donner Party of 1846\u20131847, [0] made what Geoffrey Macnab calls \"an epic comedy out of grim subject matter\". In the 1898 Klondike Gold Rush, the Tramp is a lonely prospector fighting adversity and looking for love. With Georgia Hale as [0]'s leading lady, [0] began filming his next project in February 1924. his next project's elaborate production, costing almost $1\u00a0million, included location shooting in the Truckee mountains in Nevada with 600 extras, extravagant sets, and special effects. The last scene was shot in May 1925 after 15 months of filming.[0] felt his next project was the best film [0] had made. his next project opened in August 1925 and became one of the highest-grossing films of the silent era with a U.S. box-office of $5\u00a0million. his next project contains some of [0]'s most famous sequences, such as the Tramp eating the Tramp's shoe and the \"Dance of the Rolls\". Geoffrey Macnab has called his next project \"the quintessential [0] film\". [0] stated at his next project's release, \"his next project is the picture that [0] want to be remembered by\".While making his next project, [0] married for the second time. Mirroring the circumstances of [0]'s first union, Lita Grey was a teenage actress, originally set to star in his next project, whose surprise announcement of pregnancy forced [0] into marriage. Lita Grey was 16 and [0] was 35, meaning [0] could have been charged with statutory rape under California law. [0] therefore arranged a discreet marriage in Mexico on 25 November 1924. They originally met during Lita Grey's childhood and Lita Grey had previously appeared in [0]'s works The Kid and The Idle Class. They's first son, Charles Spencer Chaplin III, was born on 5\u00a0May 1925, followed by Sydney Earl Chaplin on 30 March 1926. On 6 July 1925, [0] became the first movie star to be featured on a Time magazine cover.It was an unhappy marriage, and [0] spent long hours at the studio to avoid seeing [0]'s . In November 1926, Lita Grey took the children and left the family home. A bitter divorce followed, in which Lita Grey's application\u00a0\u2013 accusing [0] of infidelity, abuse, and of harbouring \"perverted sexual desires\"\u00a0\u2013 was leaked to the press. [0] was reported to be in a state of nervous breakdown, as the story became headline news and groups formed across America calling for [0]'s films to be banned. Eager to end the case without further scandal, [0]'s lawyers agreed to a cash settlement of $600,000\u00a0\u2013 the largest awarded by American courts at that time. [0]'s fan base was strong enough to survive A bitter divorce, and A bitter divorce was soon forgotten, but [0] was deeply affected by A bitter divorce. Less than five months after A bitter divorce, [0] and Lita Grey's former butler Don Solovich was murdered in Utah, and articles speculated about connections between [0] and murdered.Before the divorce suit was filed, [0] had begun work on a new film, The Circus. [0] built a story around the idea of walking a tightrope while besieged by monkeys, and turned the Tramp into the accidental star of a circus. Filming was suspended for ten months while [0] dealt with the divorce scandal, and a new film, The Circus was generally a trouble-ridden production. Finally completed in October 1927, a new film, The Circus was released in January 1928 to a positive reception. At the 1st Academy Awards, [0] was given a special trophy \"For versatility and genius in acting, writing, directing and producing a new film, The Circus\". Despite a new film, The Circus's success, [0] permanently associated a new film, The Circus with the stress of a new film, The Circus's ; [0] omitted a new film, The Circus from [0]'s autobiography, and struggled to work on a new film, The Circus when [0] recorded the score in [0]'s later years.[0] was determined to continue making silent films\u00a0... [0] was a pantomimist and in silent films [0] was unique and, without false modesty, a master. By the time a new film, The Circus was released, Hollywood had witnessed the introduction of sound films. [0] was cynical about sound films and the technical shortcomings sound films presented, believing that sound films lacked the artistry of silent films. [0] was also hesitant to change the formula that had brought [0] such success, and feared that giving the Tramp a voice would limit the Tramp's international appeal. [0], therefore, rejected the new Hollywood craze and began work on a new silent film. [0] was nonetheless anxious about began and remained so throughout a new silent film's .When filming began at the end of 1928, [0] had been working on the story for almost a year. a new silent film followed the Tramp's love for a blind flower girl (played by Virginia Cherrill) and the Tramp's efforts to raise money for a blind flower girl (played by Virginia Cherrill)'s sight-saving operation. a new silent film was a challenging production that lasted 21 months, with [0] later confessing that [0] \"had worked [0] into a neurotic state of wanting perfection\". One advantage [0] found in sound technology was the opportunity to record a musical score for a new silent film, which [0] composed [0].[0] finished editing a new silent film in December 1930, by which time silent films were an anachronism. A preview before an unsuspecting public audience was not a success, but a showing for the press produced positive reviews. One journalist wrote, \"Nobody in the world but [0] could have done it. [0] is the only person that has that peculiar something called 'audience appeal' in sufficient quality to defy the popular penchant for movies that talk.\" Given a new silent film's general release in January 1931, a new silent film proved to be a popular and financial success, eventually grossing over $3\u00a0million. The British Film Institute called a new silent film [0]'s finest accomplishment, and the critic James Agee hails the closing scene as \"the greatest piece of acting and the highest moment in movies\". a new silent film became [0]'s personal favourite of [0]'s and remained so throughout [0]'s life.a new silent film had been a success, but [0] was unsure if [0] could make another picture without dialogue. [0] remained convinced that sound would not work in [0]'s , but was also \"obsessed by a depressing fear of being old-fashioned\". In this state of uncertainty, early in 1931, [0] decided to take a holiday and ended up travelling for 16 months. [0] spent months travelling Western Europe, including extended stays in France and Switzerland, and spontaneously decided to visit Japan. The day after [0] arrived in Japan, Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi was assassinated by ultra-nationalists in the May 15 Incident. The group's original plan had been to provoke a war with America by assassinating [0] at a welcome reception organised by the prime minister, but The group's original plan had been foiled due to delayed public announcement of a welcome reception organised by the prime minister's date.In [0]'s autobiography, [0] recalled that on [0]'s return to Los Angeles, \"[0] was confused and without plan, restless and conscious of an extreme loneliness\". [0] briefly considered retiring and moving to China. an extreme loneliness was relieved when [0] met 21-year-old actress Paulette Goddard in July 1932, and the pair began a relationship. [0] was not ready to commit to a film, however, and focused on writing a serial about [0]'s travels (published in Woman's Home Companion). The trip had been a stimulating experience for [0], including meetings with several prominent thinkers, and [0] became increasingly interested in world affairs. The state of labour in America troubled [0], and [0] feared that capitalism and machinery in the workplace would increase unemployment levels. It was these concerns that stimulated [0] to develop his new film.his new film was announced by [0] as \"a satire on certain phases of our industrial life\". Featuring the Tramp and Goddard 21-year-old actress Paulette Goddard as the Tramp and Goddard endure the Great Depression, his new film took ten and a half months to film. [0] intended to use spoken dialogue but changed [0]'s mind during rehearsals. Like a new silent film, his new film employed sound effects but almost no speaking. [0]'s performance of a gibberish song did, however, give the Tramp a voice for the only time on film. After recording the music, [0] released his new film in February 1936. his new film was [0]'s first feature in 15 years to adopt political references and social realism, a factor that attracted considerable press coverage despite [0]'s attempts to downplay the issue. his new film earned less at the box-office than [0]'s previous features and received mixed reviews, as some viewers disliked the politicising. Today, his new film is seen by The British Film Institute as one of [0]'s \"great features\", while David Robinson says his new film shows [0] at \"[0]'s unrivalled peak as a creator of visual comedy\".Following the release of his new film, [0] left with 21-year-old actress Paulette Goddard for a trip to the Far East. Chaplin, Goddard, and a Japanese servant named Yonnemori arrived in Saigon at 8:30 am on 13 April 1936, where Chaplin, Goddard, and a Japanese servant named Yonnemori stayed at the Continental hotel before going on a trip to visit multiple locations in French Indochina. After Saigon Chaplin, Goddard, and a Japanese servant named Yonnemori visited Phnom Penh to view Angkor Wat, returning to Saigon to go to Da Lat, followed by Hu\u1ebf, arriving in \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng at 23 April where [0] visited the Marble Mountains and the Henri Parmentier Museum. On 29 April Chaplin, Goddard, and a Japanese servant named Yonnemori arrived in Hanoi (the capital city of French Indochina) where Chaplin, Goddard, and a Japanese servant named Yonnemori stayed at the M\u00e9tropole hotel. In the afternoon of 5 May Chaplin, Goddard, and a Japanese servant named Yonnemori visited the popular tourist destination H\u1ea1 Long Bay, after visiting the popular tourist destination H\u1ea1 Long Bay Chaplin, Goddard, and a Japanese servant named Yonnemori left from H\u1ea3i Ph\u00f2ng to Hong Kong on board of a ship named the Canton. Chaplin, Goddard, and a Japanese servant named Yonnemori had refused to comment on the nature of Chaplin, Goddard, and a Japanese servant named Yonnemori's relationship, and it was not known whether Chaplin, Goddard, and a Japanese servant named Yonnemori were married or not. Sometime later, [0] revealed that Chaplin, Goddard, and a Japanese servant named Yonnemori married in board of a ship named the Canton during The trip. By 1938, Chaplin, Goddard, and a Japanese servant named Yonnemori had drifted apart, as Chaplin, Goddard, and a Japanese servant named Yonnemori focused heavily on Chaplin, Goddard, and a Japanese servant named Yonnemori's work, although 21-year-old actress Paulette Goddard was again [0]'s leading lady in [0]'s next feature film, The Great Dictator. 21-year-old actress Paulette Goddard eventually divorced [0] in Mexico in 1942, citing incompatibility and separation for more than a year.", "1939\u20131952: controversies and fading popularity": "[0] is our person to focus on. The 1940s saw [0] face a series of controversies, both in his work and in his personal life, which changed his fortunes and severely affected his popularity in the United States. The first of a series of controversies, both in his work and in his personal life, which changed his fortunes and severely affected his popularity in the United States was [0]'s growing boldness in expressing [0]'s political beliefs. Deeply disturbed by the surge of militaristic nationalism in 1930s world politics, [0] found that [0] could not keep these issues out of [0]'s work. Parallels between himself and Adolf Hitler had been widely noted: himself and Adolf Hitler were born four days apart, himself and Adolf Hitler had risen from poverty to world prominence, and Adolf Hitler wore the same moustache style as [0]. It was this physical resemblance that supplied the plot for Chaplin's next film, The Great Dictator, which directly satirised Hitler and attacked fascism.[0] spent two years developing the script and began filming in September 1939, six days after Britain declared war on Germany. [0] had submitted to using spoken dialogue, partly out of acceptance that [0] had no other choice, but also because [0] recognised spoken dialogue as a better method for delivering a political message. Making a comedy about Adolf Hitler was seen as highly controversial, but [0]'s financial independence allowed [0] to take the risk. \"[0] was determined to go ahead\", [0] later wrote, \"for Adolf Hitler must be laughed at.\" [0] replaced the Tramp (while wearing similar attire) with \"A Jewish Barber\", a reference to the Nazi Party's belief that [0] was Jewish. In a dual performance, [0] also played the dictator \"Adenoid Hynkel\", a parody of Hitler.Chaplin's next film, The Great Dictator, which directly satirised Hitler and attacked fascism spent a year in production and was released in October 1940. Chaplin's next film, The Great Dictator, which directly satirised Hitler and attacked fascism generated a vast amount of publicity, with a critic for The New York Times calling Chaplin's next film, The Great Dictator, which directly satirised Hitler and attacked fascism \"the most eagerly awaited picture of the year\", and Chaplin's next film, The Great Dictator, which directly satirised Hitler and attacked fascism was one of the biggest money-makers of The 1940s. The ending was unpopular, however, and generated controversy. [0] concluded Chaplin's next film, The Great Dictator, which directly satirised Hitler and attacked fascism with a five-minute speech in which [0] abandoned the dictator \"Adenoid Hynkel\", a parody of Hitler, looked directly into the camera, and pleaded against war and fascism. Charles J. Maland has identified this overt preaching as triggering a decline in [0]'s popularity, and writes, \"Henceforth, no movie fan would ever be able to separate the dimension of politics from [[0]'s] star image\". Nevertheless, both Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt liked Chaplin's next film, The Great Dictator, which directly satirised Hitler and attacked fascism. Franklin D. Roosevelt subsequently invited [0] to read Chaplin's next film, The Great Dictator, which directly satirised Hitler and attacked fascism's over the radio during his January 1941 inauguration, with the film's final speech becoming a \"hit\" of his January 1941 inauguration. [0] was often invited to other patriotic functions to read the film's final speech to audiences during the years of the war. [0] received five Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay and Best Actor.In the mid-1940s, [0] was involved in a series of trials that occupied most of [0]'s time and significantly affected [0]'s public image. The troubles stemmed from [0]'s affair with an aspiring actress named Joan Barry, with whom he was involved intermittently between June 1941 and the autumn of 1942. an aspiring actress named Joan Barry, with whom he was involved intermittently between June 1941 and the autumn of 1942 reappeared the following year and announced that an aspiring actress named Joan Barry, with whom he was involved intermittently between June 1941 and the autumn of 1942 was pregnant with [0]'s child. As [0] denied was, an aspiring actress named Joan Barry, with whom he was involved intermittently between June 1941 and the autumn of 1942 filed a paternity suit against [0].The director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), J. Edgar Hoover, who had long been suspicious of [0]'s political leanings, used the opportunity to generate negative publicity about [0]. As part of a smear campaign to damage [0]'s image, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) named [0] in four indictments related to the Barry casean aspiring actress named Joan Barry, with whom he was involved intermittently between June 1941 and the autumn of 1942 . Most serious of four indictments related to the Barry case was an alleged violation of the Mann Act, which prohibits the transportation of women across state boundaries for sexual purposes.[aa] Historian Otto Friedrich called this an \"absurd prosecution\" of an \"ancient statute\", yet if [0] was found guilty, [0] faced 23 years in jail. Three charges lacked sufficient evidence to proceed to court, but the the Mann Act, which prohibits the transportation of women across state boundaries for sexual purposes.[aa] trial began on 21 March 1944. [0] was acquitted two weeks later, on\u00a04 April. The case was frequently headline news, with Newsweek calling The case the \"biggest public relations scandal since the Fatty Arbuckle murder trial in 1921\".an aspiring actress named Joan Barry, with whom he was involved intermittently between June 1941 and the autumn of 1942's was born in October 1943, and a paternity suit went to court in December 1944. After two arduous trials, in which the prosecuting lawyer accused [0] of \"moral turpitude\", [0] was declared to be the father. Evidence from blood tests that indicated otherwise were not admissible,[ab] and the judge ordered [0] to pay child support until Barry's child, Carol Ann, turned 21. Media coverage of a paternity suit was influenced by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and [0] was portrayed in an overwhelmingly critical light.The controversy surrounding [0] increased when\u00a0\u2013 two weeks after a paternity suit was filed\u00a0\u2013 it was announced that [0] had married his newest prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, 18-year-old Oona O'Neill, the daughter of American playwright Eugene O'Neill. [0] had been introduced to his newest prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, 18-year-old Oona O'Neill, the daughter of American playwright Eugene O'Neill by a film agent seven months earlier.[ac] In [0]'s autobiography, [0] described meeting O'Neill as \"the happiest event of [0]'s life\", and claimed to have found \"perfect love\". Chaplin's son, Charles III, reported that his newest prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, 18-year-old Oona O'Neill, the daughter of American playwright Eugene O'Neill \"worshipped\" Chaplin's son, Charles III,'s . himself and Adolf Hitler remained married until [0]'s death, and had eight children over 18 years: Geraldine Leigh (b. July 1944), Michael John (b. March 1946), Josephine Hannah (b. March 1949), Victoria Agnes (b. May 1951), Eugene Anthony (b. August 1953), Jane Cecil (b. May 1957), Annette Emily (b. December 1959), and Christopher James (b. July [0] claimed that the an aspiring actress named Joan Barry, with whom he was involved intermittently between June 1941 and the autumn of 1942 trials had \"crippled [[0]'s] creativeness\", and it was some time before [0] began working again. In April 1946, [0] finally began filming a project that had been in development since 1942. a project that had been in development since 1942 was a black comedy, the story of a French bank clerk, Verdoux (Chaplin), who loses his job and begins marrying and murdering wealthy widows to support his familya French bank clerk, Verdoux (Chaplin), who loses his job and begins marrying and murdering wealthy widows to support his family's a French bank clerk, Verdoux (Chaplin), who loses his job and begins marrying and murdering wealthy widows to support his family's . [0]'s inspiration for a project that had been in development since 1942 came from Orson Welles, who wanted him to star in a film about the French serial killer Henri D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Landru. [0] decided that the concept would \"make a wonderful comedy\", and paid Orson Welles, who wanted him to star in a film about the French serial killer Henri D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Landru $5,000[ad] for the concept.[0] again vocalised [0]'s political views in a project that had been in development since 1942, criticising capitalism and arguing that the world encourages mass killing through wars and weapons of mass destruction. Because of this, a project that had been in development since 1942 met with controversy when a project that had been in development since 1942 was released in April 1947; [0] was booed at the premiere, and there were calls for a boycott. a project that had been in development since 1942 was the first [0] release that failed both critically and commercially in the United States. a project that had been in development since 1942 was more successful abroad, and [0]'s screenplay was nominated at the Academy Awards. [0] was proud of a project that had been in development since 1942, writing in [0]'s autobiography, \"a project that had been in development since 1942 is the cleverest and most brilliant film [0] have yet made.\"The negative reaction to a project that had been in development since 1942 was largely the result of changes in [0]'s public image. Along with the damage of the Joan Barry scandal, [0] was publicly accused of being a communist. [0]'s political activity had heightened during World War II, when [0] campaigned for the opening of a Second Front to help the Soviet Union and supported various Soviet\u2013American friendship groups. [0] was also friendly with several suspected communists, and attended functions given by Soviet diplomats in Los Angeles. In the political climate of the United States, such activities meant [0] was considered, as Larcher writes, \"dangerously progressive and amoral\". the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) wanted [0] out of the United States, and launched an official investigation in early 1947.[ae]Chaplin denied being a communist, instead calling [0] a \"peacemonger\", but felt the government's effort to suppress the ideology was an unacceptable infringement of civil liberties. Unwilling to be quiet about the issue, [0] openly protested against the trials of Communist Party members and the activities of the House Un-American Activities Committee. [0] received a subpoena to appear before the House Un-American Activities Committee but was not called to testify. As [0]'s activities were widely reported in the press, and Cold War fears grew, questions were raised over [0]'s failure to take American citizenship. Calls were made for [0] to be deported; in one extreme and widely published example, Representative John E. Rankin, who helped establish the House Un-American Activities Committee, told Congress in June 1947: \"[[0]'s] very life in Hollywood is detrimental to the moral fabric of the United States. [If [0] is deported]\u00a0... [0]'s loathsome pictures can be kept from before the eyes of the American youth. [0] should be deported and gotten rid of at once.\"In 2003, declassified British archives belonging to the British Foreign Office revealed that George Orwell secretly accused [0] of being a secret communist and a friend of the United States in the Orwell's list document. [0]'s name was one of 35 that George Orwell gave to the Information Research Department (IRD), a secret British Cold War propaganda department which worked closely with the CIA. [0] was not the only actor in the United States whom George Orwell accused of being a secret communist. George Orwell also described American civil-rights leader and actor Paul Robeson as being \"anti-white\".Although [0] remained politically active in the years following the failure of Monsieur Verdoux,[af] his next film, about a forgotten music hall comedian and a young ballerina in Edwardian London, was devoid of political themes. his next film, about a forgotten music hall comedian and a young ballerina in Edwardian London was heavily autobiographical, alluding not only to [0]'s childhood and the lives of [0]'s parents, but also to [0]'s loss of popularity in the United States. The cast included various members of [0]'s family, including [0]'s five oldest children and [0]'s half-brother, Wheeler Dryden.Filming began in November 1951, by which time [0] had spent three years working on the story.[ag] [0] aimed for a more serious tone than any of [0]'s previous films, regularly using the word \"melancholy\" when explaining [0]'s plans to [0]'s co-star Claire Bloom. his next film, about a forgotten music hall comedian and a young ballerina in Edwardian London featured a cameo appearance from Buster Keaton, whom [0] cast as [0]'s stage partner in a pantomime scene. This marked the only time the comedians worked together in a feature film.[0] decided to hold the world premiere of his next film, about a forgotten music hall comedian and a young ballerina in Edwardian London in Edwardian London, since Edwardian London was the setting of his next film, about a forgotten music hall comedian and a young ballerina in Edwardian London. As [0] left Los Angeles, [0] expressed a premonition that [0] would not be returning. At New York, [0] boarded the RMS\u00a0Queen Elizabeth with [0]'s family on 18 September 1952. The next day, United States Attorney General James P. McGranery revoked [0]'s re-entry permit and stated that [0] would have to submit to an interview concerning [0]'s political views and moral behaviour to re-enter the United States. Although United States Attorney General James P. McGranery told the press that United States Attorney General James P. McGranery had \"a pretty good case against [0]\", Charles J. Maland has concluded, on the basis of the the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) files that were released in the 1980s, that the United States had no real evidence to prevent [0]'s . It is likely that [0] would have gained re if [0] had applied for re. However, when [0] received a cablegram informing [0] of the news, [0] privately decided to cut [0]'s ties with the United States:Whether [0] re-entered the United States or not was of little consequence to [0]. [0] would like to have told the United States that the sooner [0] was rid of that hate-beleaguered atmosphere the better, that [0] was fed up of the United States's insults and moral pomposity\u00a0... Because all of [0]'s property remained in the United States, [0] refrained from saying anything negative about the Joan Barry scandal to the press. the Joan Barry scandal attracted vast attention, but [0] and his next film, about a forgotten music hall comedian and a young ballerina in Edwardian London were warmly received in Europe. In the United States, the hostility towards [0] continued, and, although his next film, about a forgotten music hall comedian and a young ballerina in Edwardian London received some positive reviews, his next film, about a forgotten music hall comedian and a young ballerina in Edwardian London was subjected to a wide-scale boycott. Reflecting on this, Charles J. Maland writes that [0]'s fall, from an \"unprecedented\" level of popularity, \"may be the most dramatic in the history of stardom in the United States\".", "1953\u20131977: European years": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] have been the object of lies and propaganda by powerful reactionary groups who, by their influence and by the aid of America's's yellow press, have created an unhealthy atmosphere in which liberal-minded individuals can be singled out and persecuted. Under these conditions [0] find it virtually impossible to continue [0]'s motion-picture work, and [0] have therefore given up [0]'s residence in America's. [0] did not attempt to return to America's after his re-entry permit was revoked, and instead sent [0]'s to settle [0]'s affairs.[ah] The couple decided to settle in Switzerland and, in January 1953, the family moved into the family's permanent home: Manoir de Ban, a 14-hectare (35-acre) estate overlooking Lake Geneva in Corsier-sur-Vevey.[ai] [0] put [0]'s Beverly Hills house and studio up for sale in March, and surrendered his re-entry permit in April. The next year, [0]'s renounced his wife's US citizenship and became a British citizen. [0] severed the last of [0]'s professional ties with America's in 1955, when [0] sold the remainder of [0]'s stock in United Artists, which had been in financial difficulty since the early 1940s.[0] remained a controversial figure throughout the 1950s, especially after [0] was awarded the International Peace Prize by the communist-led World Peace Council, and after [0]'s meetings with Zhou Enlai and Nikita Khrushchev. [0] began developing his first European film, A King in New York, in 1954. Casting [0] as an exiled king who seeks asylum in the United States, [0] included several of [0]'s recent experiences in the screenplay. [0]'s son, Michael, was cast as a boy whose parents are targeted by the FBI, while an exiled king who seeks asylum in the United States faces accusations of communism. his first European film, A King in New York, parodied HUAC and attacked elements of the 1950s culture\u00a0\u2013 including consumerism, plastic surgery, and wide-screen cinema. In a review, the playwright John Osborne called his first European film, A King in New York, [0]'s \"most bitter\" and \"most openly personal\" film. In a 1957 interview, when asked to clarify [0]'s political views, [0] stated \"As for politics, [0] am an anarchist. [0] hate government and rules\u00a0\u2013 and fetters\u00a0... People must be free.[0] founded a new production company, Attica, and used Shepperton Studios for the shooting. Filming in England proved a difficult experience, as [0] was used to [0]'s own Hollywood studio and familiar crew, and no longer had limitless production time. According to Robinson, this had an effect on the quality of his first European film, A King in New York,. his first European film, A King in New York, was released in September 1957, and received mixed reviews. [0] banned American journalists from his first European film, A King in New York,'s Paris premi\u00e8re and decided not to release his first European film, A King in New York, in America's. release severely limited his first European film, A King in New York,'s revenue, although his first European film, A King in New York, achieved moderate commercial success in Europe. his first European film, A King in New York, was not shown in America's until 1973.In the last two decades of [0]'s career, [0] concentrated on re-editing and scoring his old films for re-release, along with securing his old films's ownership and distribution rights. In an interview [0] gave in 1959, the year of [0]'s 70th birthday, [0] stated that there was still \"room for the Little Man in the atomic age\". The first of re was The [0] Revue (1959), which included new versions of A Dog's Life, Shoulder Arms, and The Pilgrim.In America's, the political atmosphere began to change and attention was once again directed to [0]'s films instead of [0]'s views. In July 1962, the New York Times published an editorial stating, \"the New York Times do not believe America's would be in danger if yesterday's unforgotten little tramp were allowed to amble down the gangplank of a steamer or plane in an American port\". July 1962, [0] was invested with the honorary degree of Doctor of Letters by the universities of Oxford and Durham. In November 1963, the Plaza Theater in New York started a year-long series of [0]'s films, including Monsieur Verdoux and Limelight, which gained excellent reviews from American critics. September 1964 saw the release of Chaplin's memoir, My Autobiography, which he had been working on since 1957. Chaplin's memoir, My Autobiography, which he had been working on since 1957 became a worldwide best-seller. Chaplin's memoir, My Autobiography, which he had been working on since 1957 focused on [0]'s early years and personal life, and was criticised for lacking information on [0]'s film career.Shortly after the publication of Chaplin's memoir, My Autobiography, which he had been working on since 1957, [0] began work on A Countess from Hong Kong (1967), a romantic comedy based on a script [0] had written for Paulette Goddard in the 1930s. Set on an ocean liner, Chaplin's memoir, My Autobiography, which he had been working on since 1957 starred Marlon Brando as an American ambassador and Sophia Loren as a stowaway found in an American ambassador's cabin. Chaplin's memoir, My Autobiography, which he had been working on since 1957 differed from [0]'s earlier productions in several aspects. Chaplin's memoir, My Autobiography, which he had been working on since 1957 was [0]'s first to use Technicolor and the widescreen format, while [0] concentrated on directing and appeared on-screen only in a cameo role as a seasick steward. [0] also signed a deal with Universal Pictures and appointed [0]'s assistant, Jerome Epstein, as the producer. [0] was paid $600,000 director's fee as well as a percentage of the gross receipts. Chaplin's memoir, My Autobiography, which he had been working on since 1957 premiered in January 1967, to unfavourable reviews, and was a box-office failure. [0] was deeply hurt by the negative reaction to Chaplin's memoir, My Autobiography, which he had been working on since 1957.[0] had a series of minor strokes in the late 1960s, which marked the beginning of a slow decline in [0]'s . Despite the setbacks, [0] was soon writing a new film script, The Freak, a story of a winged girl found in South America, which [0] intended as a starring vehicle for [0]'s daughter, Victoria. [0]'s prevented the project from being realised. In the early 1970s, [0] concentrated on re-releasing [0]'s old films, including The Kid and The Circus. In 1971, [0] was made a Commander of the National Order of the Legion of Honour at the Cannes Film Festival. The following year, [0] was honoured with a special award by the Venice Film Festival.In 1972, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences offered [0] an Honorary Award, which Robinson sees as a sign that America's \"wanted to make amends\". [0] was initially hesitant about accepting but decided to return to America's for the first time in 20 years. return attracted a large amount of press coverage and, at the Academy Awards gala, [0] was given a 12-minute standing ovation, the longest in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences's history. Visibly emotional, [0] accepted an Honorary Award for \"the incalculable effect [0] has had in making motion pictures the art form of this century\".Although [0] still had plans for future film projects, by the mid-1970s [0] was very frail. [0] experienced several further strokes, which made it difficult for [0] to communicate, and [0] had to use a wheelchair. [0]'s final projects were compiling a pictorial autobiography, My Life in Pictures (1974) and scoring A Woman of Paris for re-release in 1976. [0] also appeared in a documentary about [0]'s life, The Gentleman Tramp (1975), directed by Richard Patterson. In the 1975 New Year Honours, [0] was awarded a knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II,[aj] though [0] was too weak to kneel and received a knighthood in [0]'s wheelchair.By October 1977, [0]'s had declined to the point that [0] needed constant care. In the early morning of Christmas Day 1977, [0] died at home after having a stroke in [0]'s sleep. [0] was 88 years old. The funeral, on 27 December, was a small and private Anglican ceremony, according to [0]'s wishes.[ak] Chaplin was interred in the Corsier-sur-Vevey cemetery. Among the film industry's tributes, director Ren\u00e9 Clair wrote, \"[0] was a monument of the cinema, of all countries and all times\u00a0... the most beautiful gift the cinema made to us.\" Actor Bob Hope declared, \"We were lucky to have lived in [0]'s time.\" [0] left more than $100 million to [0]'s .On 1 March 1978, Chaplin's coffin was dug up and stolen from Chaplin's coffin's grave by Roman Wardas and Gantcho Ganev. Chaplin's coffin was held for ransom in an attempt to extort money from [0]'s . Roman Wardas and Gantcho Ganev were caught in a large police operation in May, and Chaplin's coffin was found buried in a field in the nearby village of Noville. Chaplin's coffin was re-interred in the Corsier-sur-Vevey cemetery in a reinforced concrete vault.", "": ""}, "Filmmaking": {"Influences": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] believed [0]'s first influence to be his mother, who entertained him as a child by sitting at the window and mimicking passers-by: \"it was through watching his mother, who entertained him as a child by sitting at the window and mimicking passers-by that [0] learned not only how to express emotions with [0]'s hands and face, but also how to observe and study people.\" [0]'s early years in music hall allowed [0] to see stage comedians at work; [0] also attended the Christmas pantomimes at Drury Lane, where [0] studied the art of clowning through performers like Dan Leno. [0]'s years with the Fred Karno company had a formative effect on [0] as an actor and filmmaker. Simon Louvish writes that the Fred Karno company was [0]'s \"training ground\", and it was here that [0] learned to vary the pace of [0]'s comedy. The concept of mixing pathos with slapstick was learnt from Karno,[al] who also used elements of absurdity that became familiar in [0]'s gags. From the film industry, [0] drew upon the work of the French comedian Max Linder, whose films [0] greatly admired. In developing the Tramp costume and persona, [0] was likely inspired by the American vaudeville scene, where tramp characters were common.", "Method": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] never spoke more than cursorily about [0]'s filmmaking methods, claiming such a thing would be tantamount to a magician spoiling a magician's own illusion. Little was known about his working process throughout [0]'s lifetime, but research from film historians\u00a0\u2013 particularly the findings of Kevin Brownlow and David Gill that were presented in the three-part documentary Unknown Chaplin (1983)\u00a0\u2013 has since revealed his working process.Until [0] began making spoken dialogue films with The Great Dictator (1940), [0] never shot from a completed script. Many of [0]'s early films began with only a vague premise, for example \"Charlie enters a health spa\" or \"Charlie works in a pawn shop\". [0] then had sets constructed and worked with [0]'s stock company to improvise gags and \"business\" using gags, almost always working the ideas out on film. As ideas were accepted and discarded, a narrative structure would emerge, frequently requiring [0] to reshoot an already-completed scene that might have otherwise contradicted the story. From A Woman of Paris (1923) onward [0] began the filming process with a prepared plot, but Robinson writes that every film up to Modern Times (1936) \"went through many metamorphoses and permutations before the story took the story's final form\".Producing films in this manner meant [0] took longer to complete [0]'s than almost any other filmmaker at the time. If [0] was out of ideas, [0] often took a break from the shoot, which could last for days, while keeping the studio ready for when inspiration returned. Delaying the process further was [0]'s rigorous perfectionism. According to [0]'s friend Ivor Montagu, \"nothing but perfection would be right\" for [0]. Because [0] personally funded [0]'s , [0] was at liberty to strive for this goal and shoot as many takes as he wished. as many takes as he wished was often excessive, for instance 53 takes for every finished take in The Kid (1921). For The Immigrant (1917), a 20-minute short, [0] shot 40,000 feet of film\u00a0\u2013 enough for a feature-length.No other filmmaker ever so completely dominated every aspect of the work, did every job. If [0] could have done so, [0] would have played every role and (as [0]'s son Sydney humorously but perceptively observed) sewn every costume. Describing [0]'s working method as \"sheer perseverance to the point of madness\", [0] would be completely consumed by the production of a picture. Robinson writes that even in [0]'s later years, [0]'s work continued \"to take precedence over everything and everyone else\". The combination of story improvisation and relentless perfectionism\u00a0\u2013 which resulted in days of effort and thousands of feet of film being wasted, all at enormous expense\u00a0\u2013 often proved taxing for [0][0]'s .[0] exercised complete control over [0]'s , to the extent that [0] would act out the other roles for [0]'s , expecting his cast to imitate [0] exactly. [0] personally edited all of [0]'s , trawling through the large amounts of footage to create the exact picture [0] wanted. As a result of [0]'s complete independence, [0] was identified by the film historian Andrew Sarris as one of the first auteur filmmakers. [0] did receive help from [0]'s long-time cinematographer Roland Totheroh, brother Sydney Chaplin, and various assistant directors such as Harry Crocker and Charles Reisner.", "Style and themes": "[0] is our person to focus on. While Chaplin's comedic style is broadly defined as slapstick, Chaplin's comedic style is considered restrained and intelligent, with the film historian Philip Kemp describing [0]'s work as a mix of \"deft, balletic physical comedy and thoughtful, situation-based gags\". [0] diverged from conventional slapstick by slowing the pace and exhausting each scene of each scene's comic potential, with more focus on developing the viewer's relationship to the characters. Unlike conventional slapstick comedies, Robinson states that the comic moments in Chaplin's films centre on the Tramp's's attitude to the things happening to the Tramp's: the humour does not come from the Tramp's bumping into a tree, but from the Tramp's's lifting the Tramp's's hat to a tree in apology. Dan Kamin writes that [0]'s \"quirky mannerisms\" and \"serious demeanour in the midst of slapstick action\" are other key aspects of [0]'s comedy, while the surreal transformation of objects and the employment of in-camera trickery are also common features. [0]'s signature style consisted of gestural idiosyncrasies like askew derby hat, drooping shoulders, deflated chest and dangling arms and tilted back pelvis to enrich the comic persona of the Tramp's. [0]'s shabby but neat clothing and incessant grooming behaviour along with [0]'s geometrical walk and movement gave his onscreen characters a puppet-like quality.Chaplin's films typically follow the Tramp's's efforts to survive in a hostile world. the Tramp's lives in poverty and is frequently treated badly, but remains kind and upbeat; defying the Tramp's's social position, the Tramp's strives to be seen as a gentleman. As [0] said in 1925, \"The whole point of the Tramp's is that no matter how down on the Tramp's's ass the Tramp's is, no matter how well the jackals succeed in tearing the Tramp's apart, the Tramp's's still a man of dignity.\" the Tramp's defies authority figures and \"gives as good as the Tramp's gets\", leading Robinson and Louvish to see the Tramp's as a representative for the underprivileged\u00a0\u2013 an \"everyman turned heroic saviour\". Hansmeyer notes that several of Chaplin's films end with \"the Tramp's [walking] optimistically\u00a0... into the sunset\u00a0... to continue the Tramp's's journey.\"It is paradoxical that tragedy stimulates the spirit of ridicule\u00a0... ridicule, [0] suppose, is an attitude of defiance; we must laugh in the face of our helplessness against the forces of nature\u00a0\u2013 or go insane. The infusion of pathos is a well-known aspect of [0]'s work, and Larcher notes [0]'s reputation for \"[inducing] laughter and tears\". Sentimentality in Chaplin's films comes from a variety of sources, with Louvish pinpointing \"personal failure, society's strictures, economic disaster, and the elements\". [0] sometimes drew on tragic events when creating Chaplin's films, as in the case of The Gold Rush (1925), which was inspired by the fate of the Donner Party. Constance B. Kuriyama has identified serious underlying themes in the early comedies, such as greed (The Gold Rush (1925), which was inspired by the fate of the Donner Party) and loss (The Kid). [0] also touched on controversial issues: immigration (The Immigrant, 1917); illegitimacy (The Kid, 1921); and drug use (Easy Street, 1917). [0] often explored these topics ironically, making comedy out of suffering.Social commentary was a feature of Chaplin's films from early in [0]'s career, as [0] portrayed the underdog in a sympathetic light and highlighted the difficulties of the poor. Later, as [0] developed a keen interest in economics and felt obliged to publicise [0]'s views, [0] began incorporating overtly political messages into Chaplin's films. Modern Times (1936) depicted factory workers in dismal conditions, The Great Dictator (1940) parodied Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini and ended in a speech against nationalism, Monsieur Verdoux (1947) criticised war and capitalism, and A King in New York (1957) attacked McCarthyism.Several of Chaplin's films incorporate autobiographical elements, and the psychologist Sigmund Freud believed that [0] \"always plays only [0] as [0] was in [0]'s dismal youth\". The Kid is thought to reflect [0]'s childhood trauma of being sent into an orphanage, the main characters in Limelight (1952) contain elements from the lives of [0]'s parents, and A King in New York references [0]'s experiences of being shunned by the United States. Many of [0]'s sets, especially in street scenes, bear a strong similarity to Kennington, where [0] grew up. Stephen M. Weissman has argued that [0]'s problematic relationship with [0]'s mentally ill mother was often reflected in his onscreen characters and the Tramp's's desire to save his onscreen characters.Regarding the structure of Chaplin's films, the scholar Gerald Mast sees Chaplin's films as consisting of sketches tied together by the same theme and setting, rather than having a tightly unified storyline. Visually, Chaplin's films are simple and economic, with scenes portrayed as if set on a stage. His approach to filming was described by the art director Eug\u00e8ne Louri\u00e9: \"[0] did not think in 'artistic' images when [0] was shooting. [0] believed that action is the main thing. The camera is there to photograph the actors\". In [0]'s autobiography, [0] wrote, \"Simplicity is best\u00a0... pompous effects slow up action, are boring and unpleasant\u00a0... The camera should not intrude.\" His approach to filming has prompted criticism, since the 1940s, for being \"old fashioned\", while the film scholar Donald McCaffrey sees His approach to filming as an indication that [0] never completely understood film as a medium. Dan Kamin, however, comments that [0]'s comedic talent would not be enough to remain funny on screen if [0] did not have an \"ability to conceive and direct scenes specifically for the film medium\".", "Composing": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] developed a passion for music as a child and taught [0] to play the piano, violin, and cello. [0] considered the musical accompaniment of a film to be important, and from A Woman of Paris onwards [0] took an increasing interest in the musical accompaniment of a film. With the advent of sound technology, [0] began using a synchronised orchestral soundtrack\u00a0\u2013 composed by [0]\u00a0\u2013 for City Lights (1931). [0] thereafter composed the scores for all of [0]'s films, and from the late 1950s to [0]'s death, [0] scored all of [0]'s silent features and some of [0]'s short films.As [0] was not a trained musician, [0] could not read sheet music and needed the help of professional composers, such as David Raksin, Raymond Rasch and Eric James, when creating [0]'s scores. Musical directors were employed to oversee the recording process, such as Alfred Newman for City Lights (1931). Although some critics have claimed that credit for [0]'s film music should be given to the composers who worked with [0], David Raksin [0] Modern Timesstressed [0]'s creative position and active participation in the composing process. This process, which could take months, would start with [0] describing to the composer(s) exactly what [0] wanted and singing or playing tunes he had improvised on the piano. tunes he had improvised on the piano were then developed further in a close collaboration among the composer(s) and [0]. According to film historian Jeffrey Vance, \"although [0] relied upon associates to arrange varied and complex instrumentation, the musical imperative is [0]'s, and not a note in a [0] musical score was placed there without [0]'s assent.[0]'s compositions produced three popular songs. \"Smile\", composed originally for Modern Times (1936) and later set to lyrics by John Turner and Geoffrey Parsons, was a hit for Nat King Cole in 1954. For Limelight, [0] composed \"Terry's Theme\", which was popularised by Jimmy Young as \"Eternally\" (1952). Finally, \"This Is My Song\", performed by Petula Clark for A Countess from Hong Kong (1967), reached number one on the UK and other European charts. [0] also received [0]'s only competitive Oscar for [0]'s composition work, as the Limelight theme won an Academy Award for Best Original Score in 1973 following the film's re-release.[am]", "": ""}, "Legacy": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 1998, the film critic Andrew Sarris called [0] \"arguably the single most important artist produced by the cinema, certainly the cinema's most extraordinary performer and probably still the cinema's most universal icon\". [0] is described by the British Film Institute as \"a towering figure in world culture\", and was included in Time magazine's list of the \"100 Most Important People of the 20th Century\" for the \"laughter [[0] brought] to millions\" and because [0] \"more or less invented global recognizability and helped turn an industry into an art\". In 1999, the American Film Institute ranked [0] as the 10th greatest male star of Classic Hollywood Cinema.The image of the Tramp has become a part of cultural history; according to Simon Louvish, the Tramp is recognisable to people who have never seen a [0] film, and in places where [0]'s films are never shown. The critic Leonard Maltin has written of the \"unique\" and \"indelible\" nature of the Tramp, and argued that no other comedian matched [0]'s \"worldwide impact\". Praising the Tramp, Richard Schickel suggests that [0]'s films with the Tramp contain the most \"eloquent, richly comedic expressions of the human spirit\" in movie history. Memorabilia connected to the Tramp still fetches large sums in auctions: in 2006 a bowler hat and a bamboo cane that were part of the Tramp's costume were bought for $140,000 in a Los Angeles auction.As a filmmaker, [0] is considered a pioneer and one of the most influential figures of the early twentieth century. [0] is often credited as one of the medium's first artists. Film historian Mark Cousins has written that [0] \"changed not only the imagery of cinema, but also cinema's sociology and grammar\" and claims that [0] was as important to the development of comedy as a genre as D.W. Griffith was to drama. [0] was the first to popularise feature-length comedy and to slow down the pace of action, adding pathos and subtlety to the pace of action. Although [0]'s work is mostly classified as slapstick, [0]'s drama A Woman of Paris (1923) was a major influence on Ernst Lubitsch's film The Marriage Circle (1924) and thus played a part in the development of \"sophisticated comedy\". According to David Robinson, [0]'s innovations were \"rapidly assimilated to become part of the common practice of film craft\". Filmmakers who cited [0] as an influence include Federico Fellini (who called [0] \"a sort of Adam, from whom we are all descended\"), Jacques Tati (\"Without [0] Jacques Tati would never have made a film\"), Ren\u00e9 Clair (\"[0] inspired practically every filmmaker\"), Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut (\"Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut's religion is cinema. Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut believe in [0]\u2026\"), Michael Powell, Billy Wilder, Vittorio De Sica, and Richard Attenborough. Russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky praised [0] as \"the only person to have gone down into cinematic history without any shadow of a doubt. The films [0] left behind can never grow old.\" Indian filmmaker Satyajit Ray said about [0] \"If there is any name which can be said to symbolize cinema\u00a0\u2013 any name which can be said to symbolize cinema is [0]\u2026 Indian filmmaker Satyajit Ray am sure [0]'s name will survive even if the cinema ceases to exist as a medium of artistic expression. [0] is truly immortal.\" French auteur Jean Renoir's favourite filmmaker was [0].[0] also strongly influenced the work of later comedians. Marcel Marceau said Marcel Marceau was inspired to become a mime artist after watching [0], while the actor Raj Kapoor based the actor Raj Kapoor's screen persona on the Tramp. Mark Cousins has also detected [0]'s comedic style in the French character Monsieur Hulot and the Italian character Tot\u00f2. In other fields, [0] helped inspire the cartoon characters Felix the Cat and Mickey Mouse, and was an influence on the Dada art movement. As one of the founding members of United Artists, [0] also had a role in the development of the film industry. Gerald Mast has written that although United Artists never became a major company like MGM or Paramount Pictures, the idea that directors could produce their own films was \"years ahead of the idea that directors could produce their own films's time\".In 1992, the Sight & Sound Critics' Top Ten Poll ranked [0] at No. 5 in the Sight & Sound Critics' Top Ten Poll's list of \"Top 10 Directors\" of all time. In the 21st century, several of Chaplin's films are still regarded as classics and among the greatest ever made. The 2012 Sight & Sound poll, which compiles \"top ten\" ballots from film critics and directors to determine each group's most acclaimed films,saw City Lights rank among film critics's top 50, Modern Times inside the top 100, and The Great Dictator and The Gold Rush placed in the top 250. the top 100 included Modern Times at number 22, City Lights at number 30, and The Gold Rush at number 91. Every one of [0]'s features received a vote. [0] was ranked at No. 35 on Empire magazine's \"Top 40 Greatest Directors of All-Time\" list in 2005. In 2007, the American Film Institute named City Lights the 11th greatest American film of all time, while The Gold Rush and Modern Times again ranked in the top 100. Books about [0] continue to be published regularly, and [0] is a popular subject for media scholars and film archivists. Many of [0]'s film have had a DVD and Blu-ray release.[0]'s legacy is managed on behalf of [0]'s by the Chaplin office, located in Paris. the Chaplin office, located in Paris represents Association Chaplin, founded by some of [0]'s \"to protect the name, image and moral rights\" to [0]'s body of work, Roy Export SAS, which owns the copyright to most of [0]'s films made after 1918, and Bubbles Incorporated S.A., which owns the copyrights to [0]'s image and name. the Chaplin office, located in Paris's is held at the archives of Montreux, Switzerland and scanned versions of Their central archive's contents, including 83,630 images, 118 scripts, 976 manuscripts, 7,756 letters, and thousands of other documents, are available for research purposes at the Chaplin Research Centre at the Cineteca di Bologna. The photographic archive, which includes approximately 10,000 photographs from [0]'s life and career, is kept at the Mus\u00e9e de l'Elys\u00e9e in Lausanne, Switzerland. the British Film Institute has also established the Charles Chaplin Research Foundation, and the first international [0] Conference was held in London in July 2005.
