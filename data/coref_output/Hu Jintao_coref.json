[0] was the first leader of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) from a generation younger than those who participated in the civil war and the founding of China. Influential sponsors from the older generation promoted [0]'s rapid rise, including Song Ping, Hu Yaobang, Deng Xiaoping, and CCP general secretary Jiang Zemin.During his term in office, [0] reintroduced state control in some sectors of the economy that were relaxed by the previous administration, and was conservative with political reforms. Along with [0]'s colleague Chinese premier Wen Jiabao, [0] presided over nearly a decade of consistent economic growth and development that cemented China as a major world power. [0] sought to improve socio-economic equality domestically through the Scientific Outlook on Development, which aimed to build a \"Harmonious Socialist Society\" that was prosperous and free of social conflict.

[0] was born on 21 December 1942 in Tai County, Jiangsu province, which was under Japanese occupation at the time. [0] is a direct descendant of the Ming dynasty general Hu Zongxian, known for fighting Japanese pirates. [0]'s branch of the family migrated from Jixi County, Anhui to Taizhou during [0]'s grandfather's generation. Though his father owned a small tea trading business in Taizhou, the family was relatively poor. [0]'s mother was a teacher and died when [0] was 7, and [0] was raised by an aunt. his father was denounced during the Cultural Revolution, an event that (together with [0]'s relatively humble origins) apparently had a deep effect upon [0]his father's .[0] joined the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in April 1964. 1964 [0] graduated from Tsinghua University after studying hub hydropower stations at the Water Conservancy Engineering Department.

Unlike Wen Jiabao, the premier, [0] never granted a public one-on-one interview with the media.[0] has been noted for [0]'s liking of table tennis and ballroom dancing.[0] is also said to possess a photographic memory that became evident in [0]'s high school days."}, "Early political career": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 1973, [0] was transferred to the Construction Department of Gansu as a secretary. The next year [0] was promoted to deputy senior party secretary. In 1980, Deng Xiaoping implemented the \"Four Transformations\" program, which aimed to produce communist leaders who were \"more revolutionary, younger, more knowledgeable, and more specialized.\" In response to this nationwide search for young party members, Song Ping, the first secretary of CCP Gansu Committee (Gansu's governor) discovered [0] and promoted [0] several ranks to the position of deputy head of CCP Gansu Committee. Another prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Song Ping, the first secretary of CCP Gansu Committee (Gansu's governor), Wen Jiabao, also became prominent at the same time.In 1982, [0] was promoted to the position of Communist Youth League Gansu Branch secretary and was appointed as the director of the All-China Youth Federation. Song Ping, the first secretary of CCP Gansu Committee (Gansu's governor), was transferred to Beijing as Minister of Organization of the Chinese Communist Party, and was in charge of senior cadres' recommendation, candidacy and promotion. With the support of Hu Yaobang (no relation) and Deng Xiaoping, [0] was assured of a bright future in the Chinese Communist Party. At Song Ping, the first secretary of CCP Gansu Committee (Gansu's governor)'s suggestion, in 1982 central CCP authorities invited [0] to Beijing to study at the Central Party School. Soon after, [0] was transferred to Beijing and appointed to a position in the secretariat of the Communist Youth League Central Committee (\"CY Central\"). Two years later [0] was promoted to first secretary of the Communist Youth League Central Committee (\"CY Central\"), thus the Communist Youth League Central Committee (\"CY Central\")'s actual leader. During [0]'s term in Communist Youth League, [0] escorted Hu Yaobang, who was CCP general secretary then, in visits around the country. Hu Yaobang, himself a veteran coming from the Youth League, could reminiscence Hu Yaobang, himself a veteran coming from the Youth League's youth through [0]'s company.", "Leading the party in Guizhou": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 1985, Communist Party general secretary Hu Yaobang pushed for [0] to be transferred to Guizhou as the provincial Committee secretary of the Chinese Communist Party. [0] attempted to improve the economy of Guizhou, and reputedly visited all of Guizhou's eighty-six counties. While in Guizhou, [0] was careful to follow Beijing's's directives and had a reputation of being \"airtight\"; [0] rarely would offer [0]'s views on policy matters in public. While [0] was generally seen as an official with integrity and honesty, some locals preferred [0]'s predecessor Zhu Houze. In 1987, [0] handled the local students protest parallel to the Democracy Wall carefully, whereas in Beijing's similar protests resulted in Communist Party general secretary Hu Yaobang's forced resignation.", "Tenure in Tibet": "Hu Jintao is our person to focus on. [0] was purged by Deng Xiaoping in 1987 due to [0]'s 'liberal' tendencies, and [0]'s departure from the political scene was initially seen as unfavourable towards Hu Jintao. In 1988, Hu Jintao was transferred to become Party Regional Committee secretary of the Tibet Autonomous Region, while also taking on the role of Political Commissar of the local People's Liberation Army units. This made Hu Jintao effectively the number-one figure in the Tibet Autonomous Region. A number of Tibetans have long been opposed to government policy in the Tibet Autonomous Region. Unrest and ethnic conflict were brewing, particularly anti-Han sentiments among segments of ethnic Tibetan society. Minor clashes had been occurring since 1987, and when the scale of unrest grew, Hu Jintao responded with the deployment of some 1,700 People's Armed Police into Lhasa in February 1989 in an attempt to warn against further disturbance. Increased clashes culminated in serious rioting in Lhasa's core on 5 March 1989, five days before the 30th anniversary of the 1959 Tibetan uprising. What occurred after is a matter of dispute. Rioters accused some 1,700 People's Armed Police of shooting Rioters arbitrarily, and some 1,700 People's Armed Police claimed that some 1,700 People's Armed Police had acted in self-defense. In addition, there was speculation that Hu Jintao delayed Hu Jintao's orders to clamp down on Rioters until late into the evening, when the police chief was forced to act because the situation was spiraling out of control. Rioters were suppressed early into the next day, and Hu Jintao asked Beijing to declare martial law on 8 March.Hu Jintao's role in the demonstrations and rioting on 5 March 1989, five days before the 30th anniversary of the 1959 Tibetan uprising was never made clear. While it is general protocol that Hu Jintao must have at least implicitly approved the use of force against protesters, whether Hu Jintao actually gave orders throughout 5 March 1989, five days before the 30th anniversary of the 1959 Tibetan uprising is a matter of debate. In addition, John Tkacik cites that Hu Jintao had been coordinating with the Chengdu Military Region for troops to be on full alert as the situation progressed. Some diplomatic analysts linked what Some diplomatic analysts saw as Hu Jintao's brutal use of force to the suppression of activists and students in Tiananmen Square, which took place three months later. Whether Hu Jintao provided \"inspiration\" for the PLA on 4 June is a matter of debate, but it was clear that Hu Jintao's actions in Lhasa earned Hu Jintao unprecedented attention in the upper echelons of party power, including by Deng Xiaoping. When tanks rolled into Tiananmen Square, Hu Jintao was one of the first regional leaders to publicly declare Hu Jintao's support for the central authorities.Hu Jintao experienced high-altitude sickness in June 1990, and returned to Beijing, but remained in Hu Jintao's position for another two years, during which Hu Jintao achieved little. Hu Jintao's was seen, however, simply as a pretext to return to the center of Chinese politics, which led to some doubts as to whether or not Hu Jintao was as ill as Hu Jintao had claimed. Martin Seiff of United Press International commented on Putin and Hu: \"Putin and Hu are tough and able authoritarians who had extensive experience of repressing dissent on Putin and Hu's rise to the top.\""}, "Rise to power": {"": "Hu Jintao is our person to focus on. Before the opening of the 14th National Congress of [0] in 1992, senior party leaders, including Deng and Chen Yun, were to select candidates for the CCP Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) to ensure a smooth transition of power from the so-called second-generation leaders (Deng, Chen Yun, Li Xiannian, Wang Zhen, etc.) to third-generation leaders (Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi etc.). Deng also proposed considering another candidate for a further future transition, preferably someone under fifty to represent the next generation of leaders. Song Ping, as the organization chief, recommended Hu Jintao as an ideal candidate for the prospect of a future leader. As a result, shortly before Hu Jintao's 50th birthday, Hu Jintao became the youngest (aged 49 in October 1992) member of the CCP Politburo Standing Committee (PSC), and one of the youngest [0] members since [0] assumed power in 1949.In 1992, Hu Jintao took charge of the Secretariat of [0] as [0]'s first secretary, which oversaw day-to-day operations of the [0] Central Committee, and the Central Party School, which was convenient for Hu Jintao to bring up Hu Jintao's own supporters among senior [0] cadres. Hu Jintao was also put in charge of the ideological work of [0]. Although Hu Jintao was considered heir apparent to Jiang Zemin, Hu Jintao always took great care to ensure that Jiang Zemin be at the center of the spotlight. In late 1998, Hu Jintao promoted Jiang's unpopular movement of the \"Three Stresses\"\u00a0\u2013  \"stress study, stress politics, and stress healthy trends\"\u00a0\u2013  giving speeches to promote Jiang's unpopular movement of the \"Three Stresses\"\u00a0\u2013  \"stress study, stress politics, and stress healthy trends\". In 2001, Hu Jintao publicized Jiang Zemin's Three Represents theory, which Jiang Zemin hoped to place Jiang Zemin on the same level as other Marxist theoreticians. In 1998, Hu Jintao became vice president, and Jiang Zemin wanted Hu Jintao to play a more active role in foreign affairs. Hu Jintao became China's leading voice during the United States bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in 1999."}, "Leadership": {"Succeeded Jiang Zemin": "[0] is our person to focus on. On 15 November 2002, after the 16th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, a new Hu Jintao-led Politburo nominally succeeded Jiang's's, while [0] became the the Chinese Communist Party general secretary, effectively making [0] the paramount leader. Additionally, Wen Jiabao became the premier. However, Jiang's was re-elected to the post of chairman of the Central Military Commission, the top military body, despite [0] taking over as the general secretary. Jiang's resigned as the Central Military Commission, the top military body chairman in September 2004, Jiang's's last official post. Following Jiang's's stepping-down, [0] had officially taken on the three institutions in the People's Republic of China where power lie; the Chinese Communist Party, the state, as well as the military.Deng Xiaoping appointed three party General Secretaries, all designed to be successors, and was instrumental in the ousting of two of three party General Secretaries, all designed to be successors, Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang. Deng Xiaoping's third and final selection, Jiang's, won Deng Xiaoping's continued, although ambiguous, backing and was the only general secretary in Communist Chinese history to voluntarily leave his's post when his's term ended.Although Jiang's stepped down as general secretary and from the Politburo Standing Committee to make way for a younger leadership, there was speculation that Jiang's would retain significant influence because [0] was not associated with Jiang's's influential Shanghai clique, to which six out of the nine members of the Politburo Standing Committee were believed to be linked. However, later developments show that many of its members had shifted many of its members's positions. Zeng Qinghong, for example, moved from a disciple of Jiang's to serving as an intermediary between the two factions.[0] and Wen Jiabao inherited a China wrought with internal social, political and environmental problems. One of the biggest challenges [0] faced was the large wealth disparity between the Chinese rich and poor, for which discontent and anger mounted to a degree which wreaked havoc on the Chinese Communist Party's rule. Furthermore, the cronyism and corruption plaguing the People's Republic of China's civil service, military, educational, judicial and medical systems threatened to destabilize the People's Republic of China bit by bit.[0] was mostly conservative on political reforms during [0]'s tenure. In the beginning of 2006, [0] launched the \"8 Honours and 8 Shames\" movement in a bid to promote a more selfless and moral outlook amongst the population.At the 17th CCP National Congress, [0] was re-elected as general secretary of the Politburo Standing Committee and chairman of the CCP Central Military Commission on 22 October 2007. At the 11th National People's Congress, [0] was re-elected as president on 15 March 2008. [0] was also re-elected as chairman of the CCP Central Military Commission.", "Domestic policy": "[0] is our person to focus on. The first crisis of Hu's leadership happened during the outbreak of SARS in 2003. Following strong criticism of China for initially covering up and responding slowly to The first crisis of Hu's leadership, [0] dismissed several party and government officials, including the health minister, who supported Jiang, and the Mayor of Beijing, Meng Xuenong, widely perceived as [0]'s prot\u00e9g\u00e9.Hu and Wen Jiabao took a more conservative approach towards reforms, and began to reverse some of Deng Xiaoping's reforms in 2005. Observers note that China adopted more egalitarian and populist policies. China increased subsidies and control over the health care sector, increased funding for education, halted privatization, and adopted a loose monetary policy, which led to the formation of a U.S.-style property bubble in which property prices tripled.The privileged state sector was the primary recipient of government investment, which, under China, promoted the rise of large \"national champions\" which could compete with large foreign corporations. During [0]'s , China increasingly funded the consolidation of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), supplying massive subsidies and favoring SOEs in regulatory matters.:\u200a217\u200a These efforts helped SOEs to crowd out foreign and domestic private sector competitors.:\u200a217\u200a Nevertheless, the share of SOEs in the total number of companies have continued to fall, dropping to 5%, though SOEs's share of total output remained at 26%. Exchange rates for the yuan were also liberalized and the peg to the U.S. dollar was broken, leading the yuan to rise by 31% against the U.S. dollar from 2005 to 2012. China's economic growth has averaged around 10% under [0], while the economy surpassed the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Japan.After taking over, Hu and Wen Jiabao proposed to set up a Harmonious Society which aimed at lessening inequality and changing the style of the \"GDP first and Welfare Second\" policies. Hu and Wen Jiabao focused on sectors of the Chinese population that had been left behind by the economic reform, and took a number of high-profile trips to the poorer areas of China with the stated goal of understanding the poorer areas of China better. Hu and Wen Jiabao also attempted to move China away from a policy of favouring economic growth at all costs and toward a more balanced view of growth that includes factors in social inequality and environmental damage, including the use of the green gross domestic product in personnel decisions. Jiang's clique, however, maintained control in most developing areas; as a result, Hu and Wen Jiabao's macroeconomic regulation measures faced great resistance.", "Foreign policy": "[0] is our person to focus on. Under Hu's leadership, China continued China's style of developmental diplomacy which had been adopted under Deng Xiaoping and continued by Jiang Zemin. China's international behavior continued to be generally pragmatic and predictable. [0] pledged that China would seek peaceful development in a harmonious world to assure the international community that China's rise offered opportunities and benefits rather than conflicts. The key attributes of a harmonious world view of foreign policy are building and accepting a world where countries diverge in countries's paths of national development and political systems, coexistence of diverse civilizations, and rejected unilateralism and hegemonic ambitions.In 2006, [0] articulated the four phases of China's foreign policy developmental objectives: (1) big powers were the key, (2) periphery countries the priority, (3) developing countries the foundation, and (4) multilateralism the stage.In 2009, [0] called for a bolstered arms control agenda at the United Nations General Assembly, joining United States President Barack Obama's earlier calls for a nuclear-free world.Throughout Hu's leadership, China's influence in Africa, Latin America, and other developing regions increased. [0] sought to develop China's relationship with Japan, which [0] visited in 2008. [0] downgraded relations with Russia because of unfulfilled deals.[0] emphasized an international relations premise of \"shared responsibility\": China would contribute to global common good, but China must not adversely affect China's core interests in doing so, and China's commitments must be conditional to those of other nations. In the analysis of academic Suisheng Zhao, under Hu's leadership, \"China remained a reluctant rising power and selectively took on global and regional obligations. Chinese foreign policy became omnidirectional, multilevel, and multidimensional.\"Early in Hu's leadership, [0] faced a pro-independence counterpart in then Republic of China (ROC) president Chen Shui-bian. then Republic of China (ROC) president Chen Shui-bian called for talks without any preconditions, repudiating the 1992 consensus. then Republic of China (ROC) president Chen Shui-bian and the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) had continued to express an ultimate goal of de jure Taiwanese independence, and made statements on the political status of Taiwan that the PRC considers provocative. [0]'s initial response was a combination of \"soft\" and \"hard\" approaches. On the one hand, [0] expressed a flexibility to negotiate on many issues of concern to Taiwan. On the other hand, [0] continued to refuse talks without preconditions and remained committed to Chinese unification as an ultimate goal. While [0] gave some signs of being more flexible with regard to political relationships with Taiwan as in [0]'s May 17 Statement, where [0] offered to address the issue of \"international living space\" for Taiwan, Hu's government remained firm in Hu's government's position that the PRC would not tolerate any attempt by Taiwan to declare de jure independence from China.After then Republic of China (ROC) president Chen Shui-bian's re-election in 2004, Hu's government changed tactics, conducting a no-contact policy with Taiwan due to then Republic of China (ROC) president Chen Shui-bian and the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)'s independence leanings and repudiation of the 1992 consensus. Hu's government maintained Hu's government's military build-up against Taiwan, and pursued a vigorous policy of isolating Taiwan diplomatically. In March 2005, the Anti-Secession Law was passed by the National People's Congress, formalizing \"non-peaceful means\" as an option of response to a declaration of independence in Taiwan.Hu's government increased contacts with the Kuomintang (KMT), its former foe in the Chinese Civil War, and still a major party in Taiwan.:\u200a138\u200a The increased contacts culminated in the 2005 Pan-Blue visits to mainland China, including a historic meeting between Hu and then-KMT chairman Lien Chan in April 2005the Kuomintang (KMT), its former foe in the Chinese Civil War, and still a major party in Taiwan . a historic meeting between Hu and then-KMT chairman Lien Chan in April 2005 was the first meeting between the leaders of the two parties since the conclusion of World War II.On 20 March 2008, the Kuomintang under Ma Ying-jeou won the presidency in Taiwan, and a majority in the Legislative Yuan. Thereafter [0] immediately turned to a more 'soft' diplomatic approach and opened the way to a thaw in relations between the two parties. A series of historic meetings between the CCP and KMT the Kuomintang (KMT), its former foe in the Chinese Civil War, and still a major party in Taiwan have followed. On 12 April 2008, [0] met with Taiwan's vice president-elect Vincent Siew in Taiwan's vice president-elect Vincent Siew's role as chairman of the Cross-strait Common Market Foundation during the Boao Forum for Asia. On 28 May 2008, [0] met with the Kuomintang (KMT), its former foe in the Chinese Civil War, and still a major party in Taiwan , metthe heads of the CCP and the KMT as ruling partiesthe Kuomintang (KMT), its former foe in the Chinese Civil War, and still a major party in Taiwan . During met, the heads of the CCP and the KMT as ruling parties agreed that the two parties should re-commence official dialogue under the 1992 consensus \u2013 that \"the two parties recognize there is only one China, but agree to differ on only one China's definition.\" KMT chairman Wu Po-hsiung committed Taiwan Taiwan against Taiwanese independence; [0] committed Hu's government to addressing the concerns of the Taiwanese people in regard to security, dignity, and \"international living space\", with a priority given to allowing Taiwan to participate in the World Health Organization.In addition to the party-to-party dialogue, de facto governmental dialogue took place via the Straits Exchange Foundation and the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits in June 2008 on the basis of the 1992 consensus, with the first meeting held in Beijing. Both [0] and [0]'s new counterpart Ma Ying-jeou agreed that the 1992 consensus is the basis for negotiations between the two partiesthe Taiwan Straits. On 26 March 2008, [0] held a telephone talk with then US president George W. Bush, in which [0] became the first Chinese leader to officially recognize the 1992 consensus. After several months of negotiations, in December 2008, the two parties agreed on the resumption of the Three Links, i.e., a re-opening of mail, trade, and direct air links between the two parties. Relations continued to be cordial between the two parties during Hu's leadership, and trade increased immensely, culminating in the signing of the preferential trade agreement Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) in 2010.", "Power transition of Xi Jinping": "Hu Jintao is our person to focus on. On 15 November 2012, immediately after the 18th [0] National Congress, Xi was elected to the posts of general secretary of [0] and chairman of the CMC by the 18th Central Committee, succeeding Hu Jintao.

In April 2014, [0] made an appearance in Hunan, visiting Hunan University and other historical sites. [0] attended the 19th CCP National Congress in October 2017.

[0] appeared in public alongside Xi Jinping on 5 December 2022, attending the farewell ceremony before his predecessor Jiang Zemin's body was cremated in Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery. [0] was accompanied by an aide."}, "Legacy": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] presided over a decade of consistent economic growth, led China through the storm of the global financial crisis relatively unscathed, and increased China's international stature immensely. China's achievements under [0] included modernizing China's infrastructure, launching China's first crewed space probe, and sponsoring two successful international events: the 2008 Beijing Olympics and the 2010 Shanghai Expo. In addition, [0]'s \"soft approach\" to Taiwan, coinciding with the election of a Kuomintang government in Taipei, improved the relationship between mainland China and Taiwan. Trade and contact between mainland China and Taiwan increased significantly during Hu's tenure. In addition, [0] and Premier Wen Jiabao's populist policies have resulted in the elimination of agricultural taxes for farmers, more flexible policies towards migrant workers living in cities, more balanced development between the coastal regions and the hinterlands, enforcing minimum wage in cities and the promotion of sustainable and affordable housing developments. The response to the SARS public health crisis and the massive expansion of health insurance coverage for middle- to low-income citizens earned [0] accolades domestically. Generally speaking, Premier Wen Jiabao's populist policies have been well received by the Chinese public.In foreign policy, [0]'s critics say that [0]'s was overly aggressive in asserting China's new power, overestimated China's reach, and raised the ire and apprehension of various neighbours, including Southeast Asian countries, India, and Japan. Such policies are also said to be provocative towards the United States. Domestic critics, including the country's elites, intellectuals, and particularly dissidents, point to various shortcomings of the Hu administration and [0]'s failure in implementing [0]'s signature \"Socialist Harmonious Society\" policy. Domestic critics, including the country's elites, intellectuals, and particularly dissidents cite, for example, that China's internal security budget exceeded China's military budget during Hu's tenure as protests and other 'mass incidents' continued to increase across China. China's Gini coefficient climbed to 0.47 by 2010, indicating a potentially unsustainable gap between the rich and the poor. the Hu administration's inability to rein in a potentially unsustainable gap between the rich and the poor and the Hu administration's renewed emphasis on the role of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in the economy led some economists to believe that [0] missed a critical opportunity for reform and structural adjustment. [0]'s increased support for SOEs, including to merger and consolidate, is a trend that has continued during the administration of Xi Jinping.:\u200a217\u200a[0]'s tough-on-corruption policies saw mixed results. While there were some attempts to increase transparency in the expenditures of official organs and bureaucrats, deeply entrenched systemic issues that were contributing to the growth of corruption remained unresolved. In addition, the massive corruption scandal that ensnared the military shortly after [0]'s departure from office showed that [0] was unable to tackle entrenched interests in the military. In [0]'s own departing speech at the 18th Party Congress, [0] emphasized the potentially devastating effects that unchecked corruption would have on the party and China. Moreover, the Hu administration's insistence on censorship and the curtailing of freedom of speech drew extensive criticism from human rights organizations and Western governments, while artists and writers inside China chided increased restrictions on cultural expressions during Hu's tenure. Although in the early years of Hu's tenure [0] attempted to pioneer a form of \"intraparty democracy\" that called for greater participation from lower-ranked members to determine policy and select the leadership, there was little evidence of meaningful changes to the party's governing structure and decision-making process.Consensus-based decision-making became a hallmark of Hu's tenure. [0] was never a strongman, did not rule with an iron fist, and was often seen as first-among-equals with [0]'s Politburo Standing Committee colleagues. Some called China's political landscape during Hu's tenure one of \"nine dragons taming the water\" (\u4e5d\u9f99\u6cbb\u6c34), that is, nine the party members each ruling over their own fief. In addition, [0] not only faced a profusion of special interest groups and political factions within the party, [0]'s ability to implement a cohesive program was also constrained by the influence of former leader Jiang Zemin. Consequently, there is debate on how much power [0] held personally to effect change. Nevertheless, within the context of the system [0] was placed in, [0] was credited for being an effective mediator and consensus-builder. [0] also won praise for stepping down as military chief in favour of Xi Jinping, and at the same time relinquishing [0]'s position as general secretary. stepping was seen as a message to the establishment and former leader Jiang Zemin that elders should retire according to protocol and avoid meddling in the affairs of elders's successors."}, "Political positions": {"Scientific Outlook on Development": "[0] is our person to focus on. Political observers indicate that [0] distinguished [0] from his predecessor in both domestic and foreign policy. [0]'s political philosophy during his leadership is summarized by three slogans\u00a0\u2014 a \"Harmonious Socialist Society\" domestically and \"Peaceful Development\" internationally, the former aided by the Scientific Development Concept, which seeks integrated sets of solutions to arrays of economic, environmental and social problems, and recognizes, in inner circles, a need for cautious and gradual political reforms. The Scientific Outlook on Development was written into the CCP and State Constitutions in 2007 and 2008, respectively. The role of the Party has changed, as formulated by Deng Xiaoping and implemented by his predecessor, from a revolutionary party to a ruling party. During his leadership [0] continued the Party's modernization, calling for both \"Advancement\" of the Party and the Party's increasing transparency in governance.What emerges from these philosophies, in [0]'s view, is a country with a systematic approach to national structure and development that combines dynamic economic growth, a free market energized by a vigorous \"nonpublic\" (i.e., private) sector, heavy-handed political and media control, personal but not political freedoms, concern for the welfare of all citizens, cultural enlightenment, and a synergistic approach to diverse social issues (the Scientific Development Perspective) that lead, in [0]'s vision, to a \"Harmonious Socialist Society\". In the view of the Chinese government, these philosophiesthe Chinese government , serve as a legitimate alternative to the West's \"Democracy Model\", particularly for developing countries. In [0]'s words, \"A Harmonious Socialist Society should feature democracy, the rule of law, equity, justice, sincerity, amity and vitality.\" Such a society, [0] says, will give full scope to people's talent and creativity, enable all the people to share the social wealth brought by reform and development, and forge an ever-closer relationship between the people and government. [0] even emphasized the potential of religious communities to contribute to economic and social development under the banner of \"Building a Harmonious Socialist Society.\"Some observers attribute the political origins of low-carbon development strategy to The Scientific Outlook on Development, although some industrial support in low-carbon development strategy had already begun before [0]'s formulation of the Scientific Outlook on Development.:\u200a23\u200aWestern criticism of [0], particularly regarding human rights, exposes [0]'s hypersensitivity to social stability but does not lay as much emphasis on [0]'s fresh commitment to address China's's multi-faceted social problems. [0]'s pragmatic, non-ideological agenda had two core values\u2014maintaining social stability to further economic development and sustaining Chinese culture to enrich national sovereignty. In domestic policy, [0] seems to want more openness to the public on governmental functions and meetings. Recently, China's's news agency published many Politburo Standing Committee meeting details. [0] also cancelled many events that are traditionally practiced, such as the lavish send-off and welcoming-back ceremonies of Chinese leaders when visiting foreign lands. Furthermore, the Chinese leadership under [0] also focused on such problems as the gap between rich and poor and uneven development between the interior and coastal regions. Both party and state seem to have moved away from a definition of development that focuses solely on GDP growth and toward a definition which includes social equality and environment effects.In 2004, [0] gave an unprecedented showing and ordered all cadres from the five major power functions to stop the tradition of going to the Beidaihe seaside retreat for all cadres from the five major power functions's annual summer meeting, which, before, was commonly seen as a gathering of ruling elites from both current and elder cadres to decide China's's destiny, and also an unnecessary waste of public funds. ordered was seen by the Chinese public as symbolic of [0]'s attitude towards corruption.In June 2007, [0] gave an important speech at the Central Party School that was indicative of [0]'s position of power and [0]'s guiding philosophies. In an important speech [0] used a very populist tone to appeal to ordinary Chinese, making serious note of the recent challenges China's was facing, especially with regards to income disparity. In addition, [0] noted the need for \"increased democracy\" in China's.", "Moral guidance": "[0] is our person to focus on. In response to the great number of social problems in China, in March 2006, [0] released the \"Eight Honors and Eight Shames\" as a set of moral codes to be followed by the Chinese people, and emphasized the need to spread the message to the youth. Alternatively known as the \"Eight Honors and Disgraces\", the \"Eight Honors and Eight Shames\" contained eight poetic lines which summarized what a good citizen should regard as an honor and what to regard as a shame. the \"Eight Honors and Eight Shames\" has been widely regarded as one of [0]'s ideological solutions to the perceived increasing lack of morality in China after Chinese economic reforms brought in a generation of Chinese predominantly concerned with earning money and power in an increasingly frail social fabric.It has become a norm for Chinese communist leaders to make Chinese communist leaders's own contributions to Marxist\u2013Leninist theory. Whether the \"Eight Honors and Eight Shames\" is [0]'s contribution to Marxist-Leninist theory is debatable, but the \"Eight Honors and Eight Shames\"'s general reception with the Chinese public has been moderate. the \"Eight Honors and Eight Shames\"'s promotion, however, is visible almost everywhere: in classroom posters, banners on the street, and electronic display boards for the preparation of the 2008 Olympics, and Expo 2010 in Shanghai. the \"Eight Honors and Eight Shames\" differ from the ideologies of [0]'s predecessors, namely, Jiang's Three Represents, Deng Xiaoping Theory, and Mao Zedong Thought in that the focus, for the first time, has been shifted to codifying moral standards as opposed to setting social or economic goals.", "": ""}, "Public image": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. Newsweek named [0] the second most powerful person in the world in 2009, referring to [0] as \"the man behind the wheel of the world's most supercharged economy.\" Forbes also named [0] the second most powerful person in the world later that year. [0] was named the 2010 World's Most Powerful Person by Forbes. [0] was listed four times (2008, 2007, 2005 and 2004) on the Time 100 annual list of most influential people. In 2010, Reporters Without Borders, an international non-profit and non-governmental organization with the stated aim of safeguarding the right to freedom of information, included [0] among the list of press freedom predators."}}
