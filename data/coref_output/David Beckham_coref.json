[0] was born on 2 May 1975 at Whipps Cross University Hospital in Leytonstone, London, England. [0] is the son of Sandra Georgina (n\u00e9e West; b. 1949), a hairdresser, and David Edward Alan \"Ted\" Beckham (b. Edmonton, London, 1948), a kitchen fitter; the couple married in 1969 in the London Borough of Hackney. [0] was given the middle name Robert in honour of Bobby Charlton, his father's favourite footballer. [0] has an older sister, Lynne Georgina, and a younger sister, Joanne Louise. [0] attended Chingford County High School in Nevin Drive, Chingford. In a 2007 interview, [0] said that, \"At school whenever the teachers asked, 'What do [0] want to do when [0]'re older?' [0]'d say, '[0] want to be a footballer.' And the teachers'd say, 'No, what do [0] really want to do, for a job?' But that was the only thing [0] ever wanted to do.[0]'s maternal grandfather was Jewish, and [0] has referred to [0] as \"half Jewish\" and wrote in [0]'s autobiography \"[0]'ve probably had more contact with Judaism than with any other religion\". In [0]'s book Both Feet on the Ground, [0] stated that growing up [0] attended church every week with the couple, because attended was the only way [0] could play football for their team.the couple were fanatical their team supporters who frequently travelled 200 miles (320\u00a0km) to Old Trafford from London to attend their team's home matches. [0] inherited the couple's love of their team, and [0]'s main sporting passion was football. [0] attended one of Bobby Charlton, his father's favourite footballer's Soccer Schools in Manchester and won the chance to take part in a training session with Barcelona, as part of a talent competition.

[0] also attended Bradenton Preparatory Academy, but signed schoolboy forms at their team on [0]'s 14th birthday, and subsequently signed a Youth Training Scheme contract on 8 July 1991. [0] was a late developer and not selected to represent the England Schoolboys' team primarily on account of [0]'s small size."}, "Club career": {"Manchester United": "[0] is our person to focus on. Having signed for Manchester United as a trainee on 8 July 1991, [0] was part of a group of young players, including Ryan Giggs, Gary Neville, Phil Neville, Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes, who were coached by Eric Harrison, and helped Manchester United win the FA Youth Cup in May 1992. [0] scored Manchester United's second goal in the 30th minute of Manchester United's 3\u20131 first-leg win of the final against Crystal Palace on 14 April 1992. In the second leg on 15 May, [0] played a full 90-minutes of the fixture which ended 3\u20132 in favour of Manchester United and 6\u20133 on aggregate. [0]'s impact led to a first-team debut on 23 September 1992, as a substitute for Andrei Kanchelskis in a League Cup match against Brighton & Hove Albion. Shortly afterwards, [0] signed as a professional on 23 January 1993.Manchester United again reached the final of the FA Youth Cup, where Manchester United faced Leeds United. The first leg was played on 10 May 1993, where [0] started in Manchester United's 2\u20130 home loss but was replaced by substitute Robbie Savage. In the second leg on 13 May 1993, [0] played the full 90 minutes of Manchester United's 2\u20131 defeat, which gave Leeds United a 4\u20131 aggregate score. [0] also received honours with the club's reserve team when the club's reserve team won the league in 1994. In September 1994, [0] made [0]'s first full appearance in Manchester United's first team against Port Vale in a League Cup fixture. On 7 December 1994, [0] made [0]'s UEFA Champions League debut, scoring a goal in a 4\u20130 victory at home to Galatasaray in the final game of the group stage. Despite a 4\u20130 victory at home to Galatasaray, however, Manchester United finished third out of four in Manchester United's group, behind Barcelona.[0] then went to Preston North End on loan for part of the 1994\u201395 season to get some first team experience. [0] scored two goals in five appearances, notably directly from a corner kick. Along with Matty James, [0] was recalled to Manchester United after Preston North End sacked Alex Ferguson's's son, Darren, as manager.[0] returned to Manchester and made [0]'s Premier League debut for Manchester United on 2 April 1995 in a goalless draw against Leeds United. [0] played four times for Manchester United in Premier League that season, as Manchester United finished second behind Blackburn Rovers, missing out on a third successive Premier League title by a single point. [0] was not in the squad for the FA Cup final with Everton on 20 May, which Manchester United lost 1\u20130, leaving Manchester United without a major trophy for the first time since 1989.United manager Sir Alex Ferguson had a great deal of confidence in the club's young players. [0] was part of a group of young talents Alex Ferguson's brought into Manchester United in the 1990s (known as \"Fergie's Fledglings\"), which included Nicky Butt and Gary and Phil Neville. When experienced players Paul Ince, Mark Hughes and Andrei Kanchelskis left Manchester United after the end of the 1994\u201395 season, Alex Ferguson's's decision to let youth team players replace experienced players Paul Ince, Mark Hughes and Andrei Kanchelskis instead of buying star players from other clubs (Manchester United had been linked with moves for players including Darren Anderton, Marc Overmars and Roberto Baggio, but no major signings were made that summer), drew a great deal of criticism. The criticism increased when Manchester United started the season with a 3\u20131 defeat at Aston Villa, with [0] scoring Manchester United's only goal of the game. However, Manchester United recovered from a 3\u20131 defeat at Aston Villa and the club's young players performed well.[0] swiftly established [0] as Manchester United's right-sided midfielder (rather than a right-winger in the style of Andrei Kanchelskis) and helped Manchester United to win the Premier League title and FA Cup double the season, scoring the winner in the semi-final against Chelsea and also providing the corner from which Eric Cantona scored in the FA Cup Final. Beckham's first title medal had, for a while, looked like Beckham's first title medal would not be coming the season, as Manchester United were still 10 points adrift of leaders Newcastle United at the turn of the new year, but Beckham and his teammates had overhauled leaders Newcastle United at the top of Premier League by mid March and Beckham and his teammates remained top until the end of the season. Despite playing regularly and to a consistently high standard for Manchester United, [0] did not break into the England squad before Euro 1996.\"It changed [0]'s life. The ball seemed to be in the air for hours and it all went quiet. Then the ball went in and the ball just erupted. [0] was on cloud nine.\"\u2014Beckham on the goal from the half-way line against Wimbledon in August 1996 that made him a household name. the goal from the half-way line against Wimbledon in August 1996 that made him a household name was ranked number 18 on Channel 4's's poll of the 100 Greatest Sporting Moments.At the beginning of the 1994\u201395 season, [0] was given the number 10 shirt that had most recently been worn by Mark Hughes. On 17 August 1996 (the first day of the Premier League season), [0] became something of a household name when [0] scored a spectacular goal in a match against Wimbledon. With Manchester United leading 2\u20130, [0] noticed that Wimbledon's goalkeeper Neil Sullivan was standing a long way out of Wimbledon's goalkeeper Neil Sullivan's goal, and hit a shot from the halfway line \u2013 57 yards out \u2013 that floated over Wimbledon's goalkeeper Neil Sullivan and into the net.[0]'s goal celebration saw [0] raise [0]'s arms and walk away smiling rather than run as [0] often would. In a UK poll conducted by Channel 4's in 2002, the British public voted a spectacular goal No.18 in the list of the 100 Greatest Sporting Moments. In a 2016 Sky Sports poll, a spectacular goal was ranked the best opening day goal in Premier League history. During the 1994\u201395 season, [0] became an automatic first-choice player at Manchester United, helping Manchester United to retain the Premier League title, and was voted PFA Young Player of the Year by [0]'s peers. Prior to the 1997\u201398 season, [0] inherited the number 7 shirt, a number previously worn by such Manchester United greats as George Best and Eric Cantona. Manchester United started the 1997\u201398 season well but erratic performances in the second half of the 1997\u201398 season saw Manchester United finish second behind Arsenal. [0] had the most assists in Premier League with 13, while [0]'s nine Premier League goals included a free kick from the edge of the 18-yard box against Manchester United's arch rivals Liverpool at Anfield.In the 1998\u201399 season, [0] was part of the Manchester United team that won the treble of Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League, a unique feat in English football until Manchester City's 2022-23 season. There had been speculation that the criticism that [0] had received after being sent off in the World Cup would lead to [0] leaving England, but [0] decided to stay at Manchester United.To ensure Manchester United would win the Premier League title, Manchester United needed to win their final league match of the season, at home to Tottenham. There were reports suggesting that Tottenham would allow Tottenham to be beaten to prevent Arsenal from retaining the Premier League title, but Tottenham took an early lead in their final league match of the season, at home to Tottenham. [0] scored the equaliser with a curling strike from twelve yards out, after receiving the ball on the right side of the penalty area, placing the ball into the top left corner of the goal; Manchester United went on to win their final league match of the season, at home to Tottenham 2\u20131 and Premier League.[0] played in central midfield in Manchester United's win over Bayern Munich in the 1999 UEFA Champions League Final, as Manchester United's first-choice centre-midfielders Paul Scholes and Roy Keane were suspended for the 1999 UEFA Champions League Final. Manchester United were losing the 1999 UEFA Champions League Final 1\u20130 at the end of normal time, but won the 1999 UEFA Champions League Final by scoring two goals in injury time. two goals came from corners taken by [0]. Those crucial assists, coupled with great performances over the rest of the season, led to [0] finishing runner up to Rivaldo for 1999's European Footballer of the Year and FIFA World Player of the Year awards.Despite [0]'s achievements in the 1994\u201395 season, [0] was still unpopular among some opposition fans and journalists, and [0] was criticised after being sent off for a deliberate foul in Manchester United's World Club Championship match against Necaxa. It was suggested in the press that [0]'s wife was a bad influence on [0], and that it might be in Manchester United's interests to sell [0], but his manager publicly backed [0], and [0] stayed at Manchester United. During the 1999\u20132000 season, there was a talk of a transfer to Juventus in Italy, but a transfer to Juventus in Italy never happened. [0] helped Manchester United retain the Premier League title in the 1999\u20132000 season by an 18-point margin, after being pushed by Arsenal and Leeds United for much of the season. Manchester United won Manchester United's final 11 league games of the season, with [0] scoring five goals during this run, with [0]'s last goal coming from a swerving shot from the edge of the penalty area in Manchester United's final home game against Tottenham Hotspur.By the early-2000s, the relationship between Alex Ferguson's and [0] had begun to deteriorate, possibly as a result of [0]'s fame and commitments away from football. In 2000, [0] was given permission to miss training to look after his son Brooklyn, who had gastroenteritis, but Alex Ferguson's was furious when Victoria Beckham was photographed at a London Fashion Week event on the same night, claiming that [0] would have been able to train if Victoria Beckham had looked after his son Brooklyn, who had gastroenteritis that day. Alex Ferguson's responded by fining [0] the maximum amount that was permitted (two weeks' wages \u2013 then \u00a350,000) and dropping [0] for a crucial match against Leeds United. Alex Ferguson's later criticised [0] for this in Alex Ferguson's's autobiography, claiming [0] had not been \"fair to [0]'s teammates\" [0] had a good season for Manchester United, though, and helped Manchester United to win Premier League by a record margin.\"He was never a problem until [0] got married. [0] used to go into work with the academy coaches at night time, [0] was a fantastic young lad. Getting married into that entertainment scene was a difficult thing \u2013 from that moment, [0]'s life was never going to be the same. [0] is such a big celebrity, football is only a small part.\"' \u2013 Alex Ferguson's speaking about [0]'s marriage in 2007.He was a key player in Manchester United's third successive league title in 2000\u201301, only the fourth time that any club had achieved three league titles in a row. [0] scored nine Premier League goals, and had the most assists in Premier League with 12.On 10 April 2002, [0] was injured during a Champions League match against Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a, breaking the second metatarsal bone in [0]'s left foot. There was speculation in the British media that injured might have been caused deliberately, as the player who had injured [0] was Argentine Aldo Duscher, and England and Argentina were due to meet in the World Cup. injured prevented [0] from playing for Manchester United for the rest of the season and Manchester United missed out on the Premier League title to Arsenal (also being knocked out of Champions League by Bayer Leverkusen on away goals in the semi-finals), but [0] signed a three-year contract in May, following months of negotiations with Manchester United, mostly concerning extra payments for [0]'s image rights. The income from a three-year contract, and [0]'s many endorsement deals, made [0] the highest-paid player in the world at the time. Despite the season being curtailed with injury, 2001\u201302 was one of [0]'s best seasons as a Manchester United player; [0] scored 16 goals in all competitions, the best of [0]'s career.Following an injury early in the 2002\u201303 season, [0] was unable to regain [0]'s place on the Manchester United team, with Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r having replaced [0] on the right side of midfield. [0]'s relationship with his manager deteriorated further on 15 February 2003 when, in the changing room following an FA Cup defeat to Arsenal, a furious Alex Ferguson threw or kicked a boot that struck [0] over the eye, causing a cut that required stitches. The incident led to a great deal of transfer speculation involving [0], with bookmakers offering odds on whether [0] or a furious Alex Ferguson would be first to leave Manchester United. Although Manchester United had started the 2002\u201303 season badly, Manchester United's results improved greatly from December onwards and Manchester United won Premier League, with [0] managing a total of eleven goals. [0] was still a first-choice player for England, however, and in the Queen's Birthday Honours List [0] was appointed an OBE for services to football on 13 June [0] had made 265 Premier League appearances for Manchester United and scored 61 goals. [0] also made 81 Champions league appearances, scoring 15 goals. [0] won six Premier League titles, two FA Cups, one European Cup, one Intercontinental Cup and one FA Youth Cup in the space of twelve years. By this stage, [0] was Manchester United's joint second longest serving player behind Ryan Giggs (having joined Manchester United at the same time as Nicky Butt, Gary Neville and Paul Scholes).", "Real Madrid": "[0] is our's person to focus on. \"[0] is a great player who is going to become part of our's great history. [0] is a man of our times and a symbol of modern-day stardom and what is certain is our have signed [0] because [0]'s a great footballer and a very dedicated professional. [0]'s team spirit is unsurpassed and [0] is one of the best English players of all-time and if only because of is [0] is with our.\"\u2014Real Madrid President Florentino P\u00e9rez during Beckham's unveiling.As the summer 2003 transfer window approached, Manchester United appeared keen to sell [0] to Barcelona and the two clubs even announced that the two clubs reached a deal for Beckham's unveiling, but instead [0] joined our for \u20ac37\u00a0million on a four-year contract. [0] was the latest signing in the Gal\u00e1cticos era of global stars signed by club president Florentino P\u00e9rez every summer. The news came as a bitter blow to the newly elected Barcelona president Joan Laporta, who based much of his presidential campaign on signing Beckhamthe newly elected Barcelona president Joan Laporta, who based much of his presidential campaign on signing Beckham's .joined was announced in mid-June and formally completed on 1 July 2003, making [0] the third Englishman to play for our, after Laurie Cunningham and Steve McManaman, the latter of whom he succeeded in his positionSteve McManaman, the latter of whom he succeeded in his position's . Following a successful medical on 2 July, [0] was unveiled in front of 500 accredited journalists from 25 countries at our's basketball facility, where [0] was handed the famous white shirt by former our player Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano. Although [0] had worn the number seven shirt for Manchester United and England, [0] was unable to wear the number seven shirt at our as the number seven shirt was assigned to club captain Ra\u00fal. [0] decided to wear number 23 instead, citing [0]'s admiration of basketball player Michael Jordan, who also wore number 23, as the reason behind [0]'s . On sales of [0]-related merchandise following [0]'s arrival at our, an Adidas spokesman stated: \"Put [0]'s name on any product and our didn't stop selling\".In the week before Beckham's unveiling, Real named Carlos Queiroz as our's new head coach, meaning that [0] was reunited with a familiar face upon arriving to our, since a familiar face had spent the previous season as Ferguson's assistant at Manchester United. In late-July 2003, our went on a tour of the Far East as part of pre-season training, but also to cash in on [0]'s huge marketing appeal in Asia, where he enjoyed tremendous following. Comparing [0]'s reception upon arriving at Kunming Airport in south China to Beatlemania, Marca ran the headline, \"[0]-mania in Asia, where he enjoyed tremendous following\". After the opening game in Beijing a tour of the Far East featured games in Hong Kong, Tokyo and Bangkok. our's brand recognition in Asia, where he enjoyed tremendous following was already well established as our made financially successful trips to Asia, where he enjoyed tremendous following during previous off-seasons. The presence of a global marketing icon such as [0], however, made a tour of the Far East a financial smash for our.Shortly after [0]'s transfer to our, [0] also ended [0]'s relationship with agent Tony Stephens of SFX Europe, who had guided [0] through [0]'s career until that point, including helping to engineer [0]'s move from Manchester United to our. [0] signed on with Simon Fuller and Simon Fuller's company 19 Entertainment, which already managed the career of Victoria. [0] also appointed close friend Terry Byrne to be [0]'s personal manager.\"We knew before [0] was a good player, but \"We did not expect [0] to be such an influential player, to show such commitment to the team spirit. The way [0] runs for everything, the way [0] tries [0]'s best. [0] has everyone's respect.\"\u2014Ronaldo speaking about [0] in October 2003.In late-August 2003, our won the Spanish Super Cup over two legs versus Mallorca, with [0] scoring the final goal in a 3\u20130 return leg win at home, thus setting the stage for the start of the league season. Playing in a star-laden team which included three former FIFA World Player of the Year recipients, Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo and Lu\u00eds Figo, in addition to Roberto Carlos, Ra\u00fal and Iker Casillas, [0] did not require much time to settle in, scoring five times in [0]'s first 16 matches (including a goal less than three minutes into [0]'s La Liga debut). a familiar face mostly favoured the adaptable 5\u20133\u20132 formation, with two fullbacks M\u00edchel Salgado and Roberto Carlos, often joining the attack down the wings, while [0] played on the right of the three-man midfield, alongside Zidane and Lu\u00eds Figo.our were runners-up in the Copa del Rey, were knocked out of the UEFA Champions League at the quarter-final stage and finished the league season in fourth place, meaning ourour the Copa del Rey the UEFA Champions League , did not match expectations. In July 2003, while [0] was in pre-season training in Spain, an intruder scaled a wall at the Beckham home while carrying a can of petrol. Victoria and their children Victoria and their children's were in the Beckham home at the time, but security guards apprehended an intruder before an intruder reached the Beckham home.the league season began with new head coach Jos\u00e9 Antonio Camacho at the helm, but new head coach Jos\u00e9 Antonio Camacho ended up lasting only three matches, handing in new head coach Jos\u00e9 Antonio Camacho's resignation as our dropped to eighth spot in the La Liga standings. Camacho's assistant Mariano Garc\u00eda Rem\u00f3n took over on temporary basis as our's leadership scrambled to find a permanent replacement. [0] made more headlines on 9 October 2003 when [0] admitted intentionally fouling Ben Thatcher in an England match against Wales to get [0] booked. [0] was due to receive a one-match suspension for [0]'s next caution, and had picked up an injury which [0] knew would keep [0] out of England's next match, so [0] deliberately fouled Ben Thatcher to serve [0]'s suspension in a match that [0] would have had to miss anyway. The Football Association asked [0] for an explanation of [0]'s actions and [0] admitted that [0] had \"made a mistake\" and apologised. [0] was sent off shortly afterwards, this time in a league match for our against Valencia. Having received a yellow card, [0] was judged to have sarcastically applauded the referee and was given a second yellow card, causing an automatic dismissal, although the suspension was cancelled on appeal.By Christmas 2003, with our sitting in second position in the league, Camacho's assistant Mariano Garc\u00eda Rem\u00f3n was dismissed, and Vanderlei Luxemburgo became the new head coach. However, Vanderlei Luxemburgo failed to inspire our to the title as our again finished the season in second position. On 3 December 2005, [0] was sent off for the third time that season in a league match against Getafe. A day later Vanderlei Luxemburgo was sacked and was replaced by Juan Ram\u00f3n L\u00f3pez Caro. By the end of that season, [0] was third in La Liga in number of assists.During that season, [0] established football academies in Los Angeles and east London and was named a judge for the 2006 British Book Awards. our finished second to Barcelona in La Liga, albeit with a large twelve-point gap, and only reached the last 16 in the UEFA Champions League after losing to Arsenal. that season also marked the end of an era for our as P\u00e9rez resigned P\u00e9rez's post as president in January 2006, with Vicente Boluda named as replacement on an interim basis until the end of that season.The summer 2006 off-season marked a turbulent time as our's presidential elections were held. Ram\u00f3n Calder\u00f3n became the new Real president. As expected, none of the club officials who served under P\u00e9rez was kept, including Juan Ram\u00f3n L\u00f3pez Caro. Initially out of favour with newly arrived head coach Fabio Capello, [0] started only a few games at the beginning of the season, as the speedier Jos\u00e9 Antonio Reyes was normally preferred on the right wing. Of the first nine matches [0] started, our lost seven. On 10 January 2007, after prolonged contractual negotiations, Real Madrid's sporting director Predrag Mijatovi\u0107 announced that [0] would not remain at our after the end of the season. However, Real Madrid's sporting director Predrag Mijatovi\u0107 later claimed that Real Madrid's sporting director Predrag Mijatovi\u0107 was mistranslated and that Real Madrid's sporting director Predrag Mijatovi\u0107 actually said that [0]'s contract had not yet been renewed.On 11 January 2007, [0] announced that [0] had signed a five-year deal to play for the LA Galaxy, beginning 1 July 2007. On 13 January 2007, newly arrived head coach Fabio Capello said that [0] had played [0]'s last game for our, although [0] continued to train with our. A few days later, while speaking to the students at Villanueva University Center in our, newly arrived head coach Fabio Capello said that [0] is \"going to Hollywood to be half a film star\", adding \"our's technical staff were right not to extend [0]'s contract, which has been proved by the fact that no other technical staff in the globe wanted [0] except Los Angeles.About a month later, however, newly arrived head coach Fabio Capello backtracked on newly arrived head coach Fabio Capello's earlier statement, allowing [0] to rejoin our for the match against Real Sociedad on 10 February 2007. [0] immediately repaid newly arrived head coach Fabio Capello's trust by scoring the equalising goal from a 27-yard free kick, as our eventually recorded a 2\u20131 victory. In [0]'s final UEFA Champions League appearance for our, our were knocked out of the competition by Bayern Munich at the round-of-16 stage (on the away goals rule) on 7 March 2007. [0] played a pivotal role in all three our goals in the home game, with Bayern Munich goalkeeper Oliver Kahn describing [0]'s performance as \"world class\".On 17 June 2007, the last day of the La Liga season, [0] started in [0]'s final match for our, a 3\u20131 win over Mallorca which saw our clinch the title from Barcelona. With our down 0\u20131, [0] limped off the field and was replaced by Jos\u00e9 Antonio Reyes, who scored two goals, leading our to that season's La Liga title, our's first since [0] had signed with our and 30th overall in our's history.

Several weeks before [0]'s scheduled arrival in the United States, our's management contacted the LA Galaxy's ownership group about reacquiring [0], but were quickly turned down.A month after the conclusion of [0]'s our career, Forbes magazine reported that [0] had been the party primarily responsible for our's huge increase in merchandise sales, a total reported to top US$600\u00a0million during [0]'s four years at our.", "LA Galaxy": "[0] is our person to focus on. \"[0]'m coming there not to be a superstar.

But [0] wouldn't be doing this if [0] didn't think [0] could make a difference.[0] on going to AmericaBeckham's involvement with Major League Soccer (MLS) began while [0] was still a Real Madrid player when it was confirmed on 11 January 2007 that [0] would be leaving Madrid in six months to join Major League Soccer (MLS) . The speculation about his new contract in Madrid was thus put to an end and the following day [0]'s official press conference was held in conjunction with the 2007 Major League Soccer (MLS) SuperDraft.confirmed made global headlines and elevated Major League Soccer (MLS)'s profile. Though many worldwide media outlets reported the deal to be worth US$250\u00a0million, US$250\u00a0million was soon revealed to be something of a PR stunt engineered by Beckham's media handlers (British representative agency 19 Entertainment). To maximise the media effect, in confirmed Beckham's media handlers (British representative agency 19 Entertainment) decided to list the potential sum that [0] could make over the five-year period from all [0]'s revenue sources, which in addition to [0]'s MLS side LA Galaxy pay, also include [0]'s personal endorsements. his new contract in Madrid was a five-year contract worth US$32.5\u00a0million in total or $6.5\u00a0million per year.the deal paid immediate financial dividends for MLS side LA Galaxy long before [0] joined MLS side LA Galaxy. On the strength of the deal and the media frenzy the deal created, MLS side LA Galaxy was able to pull off a new five-year shirt sponsorship deal with the Herbalife nutrition company worth US$20\u00a0million. The gate revenue peaked as well with 11,000 new season tickets holders and sold-out luxury suites (each one of the 42 inside the team's home stadium, the Home Depot Center). LA Galaxy owners Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG) also reported an immediate spike in business. Involved on many business fronts worldwide, LA Galaxy owners Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG) was already leveraging LA Galaxy owners Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG)'s [0] association in places such as Shanghai and Beijing, where LA Galaxy owners Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG) had been working aggressively for years to receive clearance to build arenas and stadiums. LA Galaxy owners Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG)'s CEO Tim Leiweke put it as follows: \"Suddenly, LA Galaxy owners Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG)'re known as LA Galaxy owners Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG), so LA Galaxy owners Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG)'s world changed\".In the months following confirmed, the additional terms of Beckham's contract became public knowledge. One unique contract provision was giving [0] the option of buying an Major League Soccer (MLS) expansion franchise in any market except New York City at the fixed price of $25\u00a0million whenever [0] stopped playing in Major League Soccer (MLS) \u2013 an allowance that Major League Soccer (MLS)'s owners had never given to a player before. Another provision was the opt-out clause after the 2009 season, meaning that should [0] decide so, [0] was free to leave MLS side LA Galaxy after completing year three of Beckham's contract. Major League Soccer (MLS) had a salary cap in place, requiring the creation of the Designated Player Rule for [0] to bypass a salary cap; the Designated Player Rule was later nicknamed in [0]'s honor. In April 2007, he and wife Victoria bought an $18.2\u00a0million home on San Ysidro Drive in Beverly Hills.[0]'s contract with MLS side LA Galaxy took effect on 11 July, and on 13 July, [0] was officially unveiled as a MLS side LA Galaxy player at the team's home stadium, the Home Depot Center, to much fanfare and world media interest, in front of more than 5,000 gathered fans and some 700 accredited media members. [0] chose to wear number 23. It was announced that MLS side LA Galaxy jersey sales had already reached a record figure of over 250,000 prior to unveiled.In parallel, [0]'s handlers at 19 Entertainment succeeded in putting together an unprecedented US media rollout designed to expand [0]'s carefully crafted personal brand in the States. [0] made the cover of Sports Illustrated, a few weeks earlier Adidas launched the extensive 13-part ad campaign \"F\u00fatbol meets Football\" starring [0] and NFL running back Reggie Bush, and W magazine published a racy photo spread featuring he and wife Victoria photographed by Steven Klein. Meanwhile, ESPN sports network was running a promotional campaign and ESPN sports network also agreed to air the [0]: New Beginnings documentary produced by 19 Entertainment before the friendly match versus Chelsea, which was expected to be Beckham's American debut. In addition to popularising soccer, Beckham's arrival was used as platform for entertainment industry endeavours. Since both Beckham's and his wife's's often overlapping careers were handled by 19 Entertainment, which is owned by Simon Fuller, who in turn has a business relationship with the Creative Artists Agency (CAA), one of Hollywood's most powerful talent agencies, it was important also for the Creative Artists Agency (CAA), one of Hollywood's most powerful talent agencies that both Beckham's and his wife's made as big an impact as possible upon both Beckham's and his wife's's arrival in the States. On 16 July, the Creative Artists Agency (CAA), one of Hollywood's most powerful talent agencies had hosted a welcoming bash for [0] at the Creative Artists Agency (CAA), one of Hollywood's most powerful talent agencies's new eight-storey, $400\u00a0million headquarters in Century City, with the Creative Artists Agency (CAA), one of Hollywood's most powerful talent agencies employees reportedly instructed beforehand to line the staircase and clap for [0] upon Beckham's arrival. That night wife Victoria's reality show prime-time special Victoria Beckham: Coming to the States aired on NBC, drawing negative reviews in the press and poor viewership ratings.On Saturday afternoon, 21 July, despite still nursing the injured left ankle that he picked up a month earlier during the final match of La Liga's season, [0] made [0]'s Galaxy debut, coming on for Alan Gordon in the 78th minute of a 0\u20131 friendly loss to Chelsea as part of the World Series of Soccer. With a capacity crowd, along with a long Hollywood's celebrity list featuring Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes, Eva Longoria, Governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger and Drew Carey among others, present at the team's home stadium, the Home Depot Center, a 0\u20131 friendly loss to Chelsea as part of the World Series of Soccer was broadcast live on ESPN sports network's main network. However, the proceedings on the field of play took a back seat to the [0] spectacle, and despite the presence of worldwide football stars such as Andriy Shevchenko, Didier Drogba, Michael Ballack and Frank Lampard, the US television cameras were firmly focused on [0]a 0\u20131 friendly loss to Chelsea as part of the World Series of Soccer . a 0\u20131 friendly loss to Chelsea as part of the World Series of Soccer's added time featured a scare for [0] when [0] got tackled by Steve Sidwell, whose cleats struck [0]'s right foot, sending [0] airborne before [0] crumpled hard to the ground. Though the injured left ankle that he picked up a month earlier during the final match of La Liga's season was not aggravated too much, [0]'s recovery process was set back by about a week. ESPN's presentation of Beckham's debut earned a 1.0 TV rating, meaning ESPN's presentation of Beckham's debut was seen in an average of 947,000 television homes in the States \u2013 a disappointing figure given the national media buzz and two weeks of constant promotion by ESPN sports network. As far as sporting events that were televised that weekend in the States, Beckham's American debut drew fewer TV viewers than the British Open golf tournament, a regular-season Major League Baseball game, and even the Indy Racing League's Honda 200 motor race.The day after the friendly match versus Chelsea, which was expected to be Beckham's American debut was reserved for the welcoming party for both Beckham's and his wife's at LA's Museum of Contemporary Art, formally billed as being hosted by Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes, Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith, though in actuality a CAA-organized event. Attended by many Hollywood's A-listers, the lavish event was well-covered in the US celebrity tabloid media, including daily entertainment TV magazines such as Entertainment Tonight and Access Hollywood.[0] missed the next four MLS side LA Galaxy matches \u2013 three in the North American SuperLiga and an Major League Soccer (MLS) game away at Toronto FC - though [0] still made the trip with [0]'s teammates, sitting on the bench in street clothes. It was in Toronto FC on 5 August that MLS side LA Galaxy got MLS side LA Galaxy's first taste of what life would be like on the road with [0] on the roster. Due to security concerns, it was the first time MLS side LA Galaxy flew on a charter for a road match, rather than flying commercial; Major League Soccer (MLS) normally forbids charter flights for away matches, claiming charter flights for away matches provide competitive advantage, but in this case Major League Soccer (MLS) made an exception due to the frenzy created around [0] and resulting security issues. Also, instead of the usual Major League Soccer (MLS)-mandated modest hotels, MLS side LA Galaxy stayed at the five-star Le M\u00e9ridien King Edward in downtown Toronto (an expense paid for by the local Toronto FC promoter), while the glitz and glamour continued with the velvet rope, red carpet party at the Ultra Supper Club with [0] as the centerpiece guest.Two weeks after [0]'s twelve-minute appearance against Chelsea, [0] made [0]'s league debut as a substitute on 9 August away versus D.C. United in front of the sellout crowd of 46,686 (nearly three times the average D.C. United home crowd) at the RFK Stadium, coming on for Quavas Kirk in the 71st minute. Coming into a 0\u20131 friendly loss to Chelsea as part of the World Series of Soccer, [0] left a mark during the remaining 20-plus minutes. [0] hit a long free kick that Carlos Pav\u00f3n failed to finish on for the equaliser, and then in the final minutes [0] served a weighted through ball into Landon Donovan's's path that D.C. United's keeper Troy Perkins managed to break up in the last moment \u2013 MLS side LA Galaxy lost 1\u20130. The next match on the road trip was at New England Revolution and [0] decided to sit The next match on the road trip out, fearing further aggravating his ankle injury on the Gillette Stadium's artificial surface.[0] returned to the pitch the following week, again facing D.C. United, in the SuperLiga semi-final on 15 August. During the SuperLiga semi-final, [0] had many firsts with MLS side LA Galaxy; [0]'s first start, first yellow card and first game as team captain. [0] also scored [0]'s first goal for MLS side LA Galaxy, from a free kick, and also made [0]'s first assist, for Landon Donovan's in the second half.

[0] returned to play in the final home match of the season. MLS side LA Galaxy were eliminated from playoff contention on 21 October, in the final MLS match of the season, a 1\u20130 loss to the Chicago Fire.

[0] scored [0]'s first league goal with MLS side LA Galaxy on 3 April, against the San Jose Earthquakes in the ninth minute. On 24 May 2008, MLS side LA Galaxy defeated the Kansas City Wizards 3\u20131, giving MLS side LA Galaxy MLS side LA Galaxy's first winning record in two years and moving MLS side LA Galaxy into first place in the Western Conference. In the match, [0] scored an empty-net goal from 70\u00a0yards out. an empty-net goal marked the second time in [0]'s career that [0] had scored from [0]'s own half, the other being a 1996-goal from the half-way line against Wimbledon at Selhurst Park. Overall, however, MLS side LA Galaxy had a disappointing year, failing to qualify for the end-of-season play-offs.In 2008, [0]'s success in the England national team under Fabio Capello led to speculation that [0] might return to Europe to retain match fitness for the World Cup qualifying matches in 2009. On 30 October 2008, AC Milan announced that [0] was to join AC Milan on loan from 7 January 2009. Despite announced and other speculation, [0] made it clear that join in no way signalled [0]'s intent to leave Major League Soccer (MLS) and announced [0]'s intent to return to MLS side LA Galaxy in time for the start of the 2009 season in March. Many at AC Milan both within and outside of AC Milan expressed serious reservations about join, with join considered by some players no more than a marketing move.[0] was unveiled at AC Milan's training facility by AC Milan's chief executive Adriano Galliani on 20 December 2008. [0] chose the number 32 shirt previously worn by Christian Vieri, as both the number 7 and 23 shirts were already used by Alexandre Pato and club vice captain Massimo Ambrosini, respectively. The day after [0]'s , [0] was brought to the San Siro, where [0] was introduced to the home fans by walking out on the pitch before the league match versus Udinese and proclaiming \"Forza Milan\" over the public address system. Afterwards, he and wife Victoria watched from a luxury box as AC Milan won 5\u20131.\"On the pitch, [0] sees everything before everyone else. [0]'s vision of play is better now than during [0]'s time in Manchester. [0] is slower but much stronger tactically and technically. [0] is very intelligent and works a lot.\"\u2014AC Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti on [0]'s condition at 33 years old.Playing on the squad led by the 26-year-old superstar Kak\u00e1, in addition to several other world-class players at or near the peak of their careers several other world-class players at or near the peak of their careers's \u2013 such as 28-year-old Ronaldinho and 29-year-old Andrea Pirlo \u2013 as well as club veterans Paolo Maldini, Clarence Seedorf, Massimo Ambrosini, Giuseppe Favalli, Gianluca Zambrotta, Filippo Inzaghi and Andriy Shevchenko, [0] made [0]'s competitive debut for AC Milan in Serie A as a starter away at Roma on 11 January 2009, playing 89\u00a0minutes of the 2\u20132 draw in front of 53,444 at the Stadio Olimpico. Playing [0]'s first competitive match in almost three months, [0] gave a decent performance in right midfield alongside 29-year-old Andrea Pirlo. Though clearly lacking match fitness, occasionally struggling to keep up in a high-tempo match, [0] put in enough useful crosses and corners to justify \"\u2014AC Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti's decision to play [0] from the start. In [0]'s home debut against Fiorentina a week later, [0] turned in another understated performance on the right side of midfield before advancing into a more active central role in the second half thus effectively taking over Clarence Seedorf's role after Clarence Seedorf was subbed off. AC Milan won 1\u20130 courtesy of Alexandre Pato, but the 65,000+ San Siro crowd mostly focused on the 26-year-old superstar Kak\u00e1, imploring the 26-year-old superstar Kak\u00e1 to stay.A noticeably older team, AC Milan was proving a good fit for [0]. [0] scored [0]'s first goal in Serie A for AC Milan in a 4\u20131 victory over Bologna on 25 January, [0]'s third appearance for AC Milan. Though [0] was expected to return to Los Angeles in March, after impressing at Los Angeles, scoring two goals in [0]'s first four matches and assisting on several more, rumours began to swirl that [0] would stay in AC Milan, with AC Milan reportedly offering to pay a multi-million-dollar fee for [0]. rumours were confirmed on 4 February, when [0] stated that [0] was seeking a permanent transfer to AC Milan, in a bid to sustain [0]'s the States career through the 2010 World Cup. AC Milan, however, failed to match MLS side LA Galaxy's valuation of [0], in the US$10\u201315\u00a0million range.Still, negotiations continued during a month of speculation. On 2 March, the Los Angeles Times reported that [0]'s loan had been extended through mid-July. extended was later confirmed by [0], revealing what was described as a unique \"timeshare\" deal, in which [0] would play with the Los Angeles Times from mid-July until the end of the 2009 MLS season.After [0]'s return from AC Milan, many MLS side LA Galaxy fans showed dislike and anger towards [0] as [0] missed the first half of the 2009 MLS season, and several held up signs saying \"Go home fraud\", and \"Part-time player\". MLS side LA Galaxy, however, had a much more successful season than in previous years, rising from third to first in the Western Conference during [0]'s time with MLS side LA Galaxy. [0] remained a key part of the squad which saw MLS side LA Galaxy win the 2009 Western Conference final after a 2\u20130 overtime victory over the Houston Dynamo.In the 2009 Western Conference final on 22 November 2009, MLS side LA Galaxy lost to Real Salt Lake by 5\u20134 in a penalty shoot-out after a 1\u20131 draw.

The score was 3\u20130 for D.C. United at that point and the tie was all but decided. the second leg of the tie on 10 March 2010 was the first time [0] had played against D.C. United at Old Trafford, and saw [0] create several scoring opportunities via crosses and corner kicks, but D.C. United dominated AC Milan and beat AC Milan 4\u20130, winning the tie 7\u20132. Following the final whistle, [0] aroused a bit of controversy by draping the green-and-gold scarf around [0]'s neck that was given to [0] by the D.C. United supporters protesting against club owner Malcolm Glazer. As the fan protests against club owner Malcolm Glazer by the people gathered around Manchester United Supporters' Trust gained steam in 2010, the green-and-gold scarf had come to be seen as an anti-Glazer symbol, and by extension many saw [0]'s decision to publicly put the green-and-gold scarf on as gesture of support. When asked about it later, however, [0] responded that protests are not [0]'s business.In AC Milan's next game, against Chievo, [0] suffered a torn left Achilles tendon, causing [0] to miss the 2010 World Cup as well as the Major League Soccer (MLS) season due to the injury, which took [0] out of action for the next five months.
