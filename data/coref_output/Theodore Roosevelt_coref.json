[0] was born on October 27, 1858, at 28 East 20th Street in Manhattan, New York City. [0] was the second of four children born to socialite Martha Stewart Bulloch and businessman and philanthropist Theodore Roosevelt Sr. [0] had an older sister (Anna), a younger brother (Elliott) and a younger sister (Corinne). a younger brother (Elliott) was later the father of Anna Eleanor Roosevelt who married Theodore's distant cousin, Franklin Delano Roosevelt. [0]'s paternal grandfather was of Dutch descent; [0]'s other ancestry included primarily Scottish and Scots-Irish, English and smaller amounts of German, Welsh, and French. businessman and philanthropist Theodore Roosevelt Sr was the fifth son of businessman Cornelius Van Schaack \"C.\u00a0V.\u00a0S.\" Roosevelt and Margaret Barnhill as well as a brother of Robert Roosevelt and James A. Roosevelt. [0]'s fourth cousin, James Roosevelt I, who was also a businessman, was the father of Theodore's distant cousin, Franklin Delano Roosevelt. socialite Martha Stewart Bulloch was the younger daughter of Major James Stephens Bulloch and Martha P. \"Patsy\" Stewart. Through businessman Cornelius Van Schaack \"C.\u00a0V.\u00a0S.\" Roosevelt and Margaret Barnhill, [0] was a descendant of the Schuyler family.[0]'s youth was largely shaped by [0]'s poor health and debilitating asthma. [0] repeatedly experienced sudden nighttime asthma attacks that caused the experience of being smothered to death, which terrified both [0] and socialite Martha Stewart Bulloch and businessman and philanthropist Theodore Roosevelt Sr. Doctors had no cure. Nevertheless, [0] was energetic and mischievously inquisitive. [0]'s lifelong interest in zoology began at age seven when [0] saw a dead seal at a local market; after obtaining a dead seal's head, Roosevelt and two cousins formed what Roosevelt and two cousins called the \"Roosevelt Museum of Natural History\". Having learned the rudiments of taxidermy, [0] filled [0]'s makeshift museum with animals that he killed or caught; [0] then studied animals that he killed or caught and prepared animals that he killed or caught for exhibition. At age nine, [0] recorded [0]'s observation of insects in a paper entitled \"The Natural History of Insects\".Roosevelt's father significantly influenced [0]. Roosevelt's father was a prominent leader in New York City's cultural affairs; Roosevelt's father helped to found the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and had been especially active in mobilizing support for the Union during the American Civil War, even though Roosevelt's father's in-laws included Confederate leaders. [0] said, \"Roosevelt's father, was the best man [0] ever knew. Roosevelt's father combined strength and courage with gentleness, tenderness, and great unselfishness. Roosevelt's father would not tolerate in us children selfishness or cruelty, idleness, cowardice, or untruthfulness.\" Family trips abroad, including tours of Europe in 1869 and 1870, and Egypt in 1872, shaped [0]'s cosmopolitan perspective. Hiking with [0]'s family in the Alps in 1869, [0] found that [0] could keep pace with Roosevelt's father. [0] had discovered the significant benefits of physical exertion to minimize [0]'s asthma and bolster [0]'s spirits. [0] began a heavy regime of exercise. After being manhandled by two older boys on a camping trip, [0] found a boxing coach to teach [0] to fight and strengthen [0]'s body.[0] witnessed the funeral procession of Abraham Lincoln from [0]'s grandfather Cornelius's mansion in Union Square, New York City, where [0] was photographed in the window along with [0]'s brother Elliott, as confirmed by [0]'s second wife, Edith, who was also present.", "Education": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was homeschooled, mostly by tutors and [0]'s parents. Biographer H. W. Brands argued that \"The most obvious drawback to [0]'s home schooling was uneven coverage of the various areas of human knowledge.\" [0] was solid in geography and bright in history, biology, French, and German; however, [0] struggled in mathematics and the classical languages. When [0] entered Harvard College on September 27, 1876, his father advised: \"Take care of [0]'s morals first, [0]'s health next, and finally [0]'s studies.\" His father's sudden death on February 9, 1878, devastated [0], but [0] eventually recovered and doubled [0]'s activities.his father regularly led the family in prayers. While at Harvard College, [0] emulated his father by teaching Sunday School for more than three years at Christ Church in Cambridge. When the minister at Christ Church in Cambridge eventually insisted [0] become an Episcopalian to continue teaching in Sunday School, [0] declined, and instead began teaching a mission class in a poor section of Cambridge.[0] did well in science, philosophy, and rhetoric courses but continued to struggle in Latin and Greek. [0] studied biology intently and was already an accomplished naturalist and a published ornithologist. [0] read prodigiously with an almost photographic memory. While at Harvard College, [0] participated in rowing and boxing; [0] was once runner-up in an intramural boxing tournament. [0] was a member of the Alpha Delta Phi literary society (later the Fly Club), the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity, and the prestigious Porcellian Club; [0] was also an editor of The Harvard Advocate. In 1880, [0] graduated Phi Beta Kappa (22nd of 177) from Harvard College with an A.B. magna cum laude. Biographer Henry F. Pringle states:[0], attempting to analyze [0]'s college career and weigh the benefits [0] had received, felt that [0] had obtained little from Harvard College. [0] had been depressed by the formalistic treatment of many subjects, by the rigidity, the attention to minutiae that were important in themselves, but which somehow were never linked up with the whole. After His father's sudden death on February 9, 1878,, [0] had inherited $65,000 (equivalent to $1,971,069 in 2022), enough wealth on which [0] could live comfortably for the rest of [0]'s life. [0] gave up [0]'s earlier plan of studying natural science and decided to attend Columbia Law School instead, moving back into the family's home in New York City. Although [0] was an able law student, [0] often found law to be irrational. [0] spent much of [0]'s time writing a book on the War of 1812.Determined to enter politics, [0] began attending meetings at Morton Hall, the 59th Street headquarters of New York City's 21st District Republican Association. Though his father had been a prominent member of the Republican Party, [0] made an unorthodox career choice for someone of [0]'s class, as most of [0]'s peers refrained from becoming too closely involved in politics. [0] found allies in the local Republican Party and defeated an incumbent Republican state assemblyman tied to the political machine of Senator Roscoe Conkling closely. After [0]'s election victory, [0] decided to drop out of law school, later saying, \"[0] intended to be one of the governing class.\"", "Naval history and strategy": "[0] is our person to focus on. While at Harvard, [0] began a systematic study of the role played by the United States Navy in the War of 1812. Assisted by two uncles, [0] scrutinized original source materials and official the United States Navy records, ultimately publishing The Naval War of 1812 in 1882. The Naval War of 1812 contained drawings of individual and combined ship maneuvers, charts depicting the differences in iron throw weights of cannon shot between rival forces, and analyses of the differences and similarities between British and American leadership down to the ship-to-ship level. Upon release, The Naval War of 1812 was praised for The Naval War of 1812's scholarship and style, and The Naval War of 1812 remains a standard study of the War of 1812.With the publication of The Influence of Sea Power upon History in 1890, Navy Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan was hailed as the world's's outstanding naval theorist by the leaders of Europe immediately. [0] paid very close attention to Navy Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan's emphasis that only a nation with the world's most powerful fleet could dominate the world's's oceans, exert only a nation with the world's most powerful fleet's diplomacy to the fullest, and defend only a nation with the world's most powerful fleet's own borders. [0] incorporated Navy Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan's ideas into [0]'s views on naval strategy for the remainder of [0]'s career.", "First marriage and widowerhood": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 1880, [0] married socialite Alice Hathaway Lee. Their daughter, Alice Lee Roosevelt, was born on February 12, 1884. Two days later, socialite Alice Hathaway Lee died of undiagnosed kidney failure that the pregnancy masked. In [0]'s diary, [0] wrote a large \"X\" on the page and then, \"The light has gone out of [0]'s life.\" His mother, Martha, had died of typhoid fever eleven hours earlier at 3:00\u00a0a.m., in the same house on 57th Street in Manhattan. Distraught, [0] left Their daughter, Alice Lee Roosevelt, in the care of [0]'s sister Bamie while [0] grieved; [0] assumed custody of Their daughter, Alice Lee Roosevelt, when Their daughter, Alice Lee Roosevelt, was three.After the deaths of His mother, Martha, and mother, [0] focused on [0]'s work, specifically by re-energizing a legislative investigation into corruption of the New York City government, which arose from a concurrent bill proposing that power be centralized in the mayor's office. For the rest of [0]'s life, [0] rarely spoke about socialite Alice Hathaway Lee and did not write about socialite Alice Hathaway Lee in [0]'s autobiography."}, "Early political career": {"State Assemblyman": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was a member of the New York State Assembly (New York Co., 21st D.) in 1882, 1883, and 1884. [0] began making [0]'s mark immediately handling in corporate corruption issues specifically. [0] blocked a corrupt effort of financier Jay Gould to lower financier Jay Gould's taxes. [0] also exposed the suspected collusion of financier Jay Gould and Judge Theodore Westbrook and argued for and received approval for an investigation to proceed, aiming for Judge Theodore Westbrook to be impeached. Although the investigation committee rejected impeached, [0] had exposed the potential corruption in Albany and assumed a high and positive political profile in multiple New York Co. publications.[0]'s anti-corruption efforts helped [0] win re-election in 1882 by a margin greater than two-to-one, an achievement made even more impressive by the victory that Democratic gubernatorial candidate Grover Cleveland won in [0]'s district. With Conkling's Stalwart faction of the Republican Party in disarray following the assassination of President James Garfield, [0] won election as the Republican party leader in the New York State Assembly. [0] allied with Democratic gubernatorial candidate Grover Cleveland to win passage of a civil service reform bill. [0] won re-election a second time and sought the office of Speaker of the New York State Assembly, but Titus Sheard obtained the office of Speaker of the New York State Assembly in a 41 to 29 vote of the GOP caucus instead. In [0]'s final term, [0] served as Chairman of the Committee on Affairs of Cities, during which [0] wrote more bills than any other legislator.", "Presidential election of 1884": "[0] is our person to focus on. With numerous presidential hopefuls from whom to choose, [0] supported Senator George F. Edmunds of Vermont, a colorless reformer. The state GOP preferred the incumbent president, New York City's Chester Arthur, known for passing the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act. [0] fought for and succeeded in influencing the Manhattan delegates at the state convention in Utica. [0] then took control of the state convention in Utica, bargaining through the night and outmaneuvering the supporters of the incumbent president, New York City's Chester Arthur, known for passing the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act and James G. Blaine; consequently, [0] gained a national reputation as a key politician in [0]'s state.[0] attended the 1884 GOP National Convention in Chicago and gave a speech convincing delegates to nominate African American John R. Lynch, an Senator George F. Edmunds of Vermont, a colorless reformer supporter, to be the temporary chair. [0] fought alongside the Mugwump reformers against James G. Blaine. However, James G. Blaine gained support from the incumbent president, New York City's Chester Arthur, known for passing the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act's and Senator George F. Edmunds of Vermont, a colorless reformer's delegates, and won the nomination on the fourth ballot. In a crucial moment of [0]'s budding political career, [0] resisted the demand of [0]'s fellow Mugwumps that [0] bolt from James G. Blaine. [0] bragged about [0]'s one small success: \"We achieved a victory in getting up a combination to beat the James G. Blaine nominee for temporary chairman... To do achieved needed a mixture of skill, boldness and energy... to get the different factions to come in... to defeat James G. Blaine.\" [0] was also impressed by an invitation to speak before an audience of ten thousand, the largest crowd [0] had addressed up to that date. Having gotten a taste of national politics, [0] felt less aspiration for advocacy on the state level; [0] then retired to [0]'s new \"Chimney Butte Ranch\" on the Little Missouri River. [0] refused to join other Mugwumps in supporting Grover Cleveland, the governor of New York City's and the Democratic nominee in the general election. [0] debated the pros and cons of staying loyal with [0]'s political friend, Henry Cabot Lodge. After James G. Blaine won the nomination, [0] had said carelessly that [0] would give \"hearty support to any decent Democrat\". [0] distanced [0] from the promise, saying that the promise had not been meant \"for publication\". When a reporter asked if [0] would support James G. Blaine, [0] replied, \"That question [0] decline to answer. That question is a subject [0] do not care to talk about.\" In the end, [0] realized that [0] had to support James G.

For the next several years, [0] shuttled between [0]'s home in New York and [0]'s ranch in the Dakota Territory.Following the 1884 United States presidential election, [0] built a ranch named Elkhorn, which was 35\u00a0mi (56\u00a0km) north of the boomtown of Medora, North Dakota.

[0] had the only horse and rode back and forth between rifle pits at the forefront of the advance up Kettle Hill, an advance that [0] urged despite the absence of any orders from superiors. [0] was forced to walk up the last part of Kettle Hill because the only horse had been entangled in barbed wire. The victories came at a cost of 200 killed and 1,000 wounded.In August, [0] and other officers demanded that the soldiers be returned home. [0] always recalled a short, minor skirmish known as the Battle of Las Guasimas as \"the great day of [0]'s life\" and \"[0]'s crowded hour\". In 2001, [0] was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for [0]'s actions; [0] had been nominated during the Spanish\u2013American War, but Army officials, annoyed at [0]'s grabbing the headlines, blocked the Medal of Honor. After returning to civilian life, [0] preferred to be known as \"Colonel Roosevelt\" or \"The Colonel\", though \"Teddy\" remained much more popular with the public, even though [0] openly despised \"Teddy\". Men working closely with [0] customarily called [0] \"Colonel\" or \"Theodore\".[page\u00a0needed]", "Governor of New York": "[0] is our person to focus on. After leaving Cuba in August 1898, the Rough Riders were transported to a camp at Montauk Point, Long Island, where Roosevelt and his men were briefly quarantined due to the War Department's fear of spreading yellow fever. Sister Regina Purtell was one of the nurses sent to a camp at Montauk Point, Long Island, where Roosevelt and his men were briefly quarantined due to the War Department's fear of spreading yellow fever, and Sister Regina Purtell was so competent during outbreaks and so beloved by the Rough Riders that Sister Regina Purtell became friends with [0]; a few years later [0] would ask for Sister Regina Purtell to personally care for [0] when [0] was in St. Vincent's hospital. Shortly after [0]'s return to the United States, Republican Congressman Lemuel E. Quigg, a lieutenant of party boss Tom Platt, asked [0] to run in the 1898 gubernatorial election. Prospering politically from the party boss Tom Platt machine, [0]'s gradual rise to power was marked by the pragmatic decisions of New York machine boss T. C. \"Tom\" Platt, who served as a U.S. senator from New York. The demonstrated willingness of party boss Tom Platt to compromise with the GOP progressive wing led by Roosevelt and Benjamin B. Odell Jr., resulted, over time, in the GOP progressive wing led by Roosevelt and Benjamin B. Odell Jr.'s growth of political strength at the expense of party boss Tom PlattBenjamin B. Odell Jr..party boss Tom Platt disliked [0] personally, feared that [0] would oppose party boss Tom Platt's interests in office, and was reluctant to propel [0] to the forefront of national politics. However, party boss Tom Platt also needed a strong candidate due to the unpopularity of the incumbent Republican governor, Frank S. Black. [0] agreed to become the nominee and to try not to \"make war\" with the Republican establishment once in office. [0] defeated the incumbent Republican governor, Frank S. Black in the Republican caucus by a vote of 753 to 218, and faced Democrat Augustus Van Wyck, a well-respected judge, in the general election. [0] campaigned vigorously on [0]'s war record, winning the 1898 gubernatorial election by a margin of just one percent.As governor, [0] learned much about ongoing economic issues and political techniques that later proved valuable in his presidency. [0] studied the problems of trusts, monopolies, labor relations, and conservation. Chessman argues that [0]'s program \"rested firmly upon the concept of the square deal by a neutral state\". The rules for the square deal by a neutral state were \"honesty in public affairs, an equitable sharing of privilege and responsibility, and subordination of party and local concerns to the interests of the state at large\".By holding twice-daily press conferences\u2014which was an innovation\u2014[0] remained connected with [0]'s middle-class political base. [0] successfully pushed the Ford Franchise-Tax bill, which taxed public franchises granted by New York and controlled by corporations, declaring that \"a corporation which derives its powers from the Statea corporation which derives its powers from the State's , should pay to New York a just percentage of a corporation which derives its powers from the State's earnings as a return for the privileges a corporation which derives its powers from the State enjoys\". [0] rejected party boss Tom Platt's worries that this approached Bryanite Socialism, explaining that without this, New York voters might get angry and adopt public ownership of streetcar lines and other franchises.The New York state government affected many interests, and the power to make appointments to policy-making positions was a key role for [0]. party boss Tom Platt insisted that [0] be consulted on major appointments; [0] appeared to comply, but then made [0]'s own decisions. Historians marvel that [0] managed to appoint so many first-rate men with party boss Tom Platt's approval. [0] even enlisted party boss Tom Platt's help in securing reform, such as in the spring of 1899, when party boss Tom Platt pressured state senators to vote for a civil service bill that the secretary of the Civil Service Reform Association called \"superior to any civil service statute heretofore secured in the United States.Chessman argues that as governor, [0] developed the principles that shaped his presidency, especially insistence upon the public responsibility of large corporations, publicity as a first remedy for trusts, regulation of railroad rates, mediation of the conflict of capital and labor, conservation of natural resources and protection of the less fortunate members of society. [0] sought to position [0] against the excesses of large corporations on the one hand and radical movements on the other.As the chief executive of New Yorkthe United States, [0] was widely considered a potential future presidential candidate, and supporters such as William Allen White encouraged [0] to run for president. [0] had no interest in challenging McKinley for the Republican nomination in 1900 and was denied [0]'s preferred post of Secretary of War. As [0]'s term progressed, [0] pondered a 1904 presidential run, but was uncertain about whether [0] should seek re-election as governor in 1900.", "Vice presidency (1901)": "[0] is our person to focus on. In November 1899, Vice President Garret Hobart died of heart failure, leaving an open spot on the 1900 Republican national ticket. Though Henry Cabot Lodge and others urged [0] to run for vice president in 1900, [0] was reluctant to take vice president and issued a public statement saying that [0] would not accept the nomination. Additionally, [0] was informed by President McKinley and campaign manager Mark Hanna that [0] was not being considered for vice president due to [0]'s actions prior to the Spanish\u2013American War[clarification needed]. Eager to be rid of [0], Platt nonetheless began a newspaper campaign in favor of Roosevelt's nomination for the vice presidency. [0] attended the 1900 Republican National Convention as a state delegate and struck a bargain with Platt: [0] would accept the nomination if the 1900 Republican National Convention offered the nomination to [0] but would otherwise serve another term as governor. Platt asked Pennsylvania party boss Matthew Quay to lead the campaign for Roosevelt's nomination for the vice presidency, and Pennsylvania party boss Matthew Quay outmaneuvered campaign manager Mark Hanna at the 1900 Republican National Convention to put [0] on the 1900 Republican national ticket. [0] won the nomination unanimously.Roosevelt's vice-presidential campaigning proved highly energetic and an equal match for Democratic presidential nominee William Jennings Bryan's's famous barnstorming style of campaigning. In a whirlwind campaign that displayed [0]'s energy to the public, [0] made 480 stops in 23 states. [0] denounced the radicalism of BryanDemocratic presidential nominee William Jennings Bryan's, contrasting the radicalism of Bryan with the heroism of the soldiers and sailors who fought and won the war against Spain. Democratic presidential nominee William Jennings Bryan's had strongly supported the war against Spain, but Democratic presidential nominee William Jennings Bryan's denounced the annexation of the Philippines as imperialism, which would spoil America's's innocence. [0] countered that it was best for the Filipinos to have stability and the Americans to have a proud place in the world. With America's basking in peace and prosperity, the voters gave President McKinley an even larger victory than that which President McKinley had achieved in 1896.After Roosevelt's vice-presidential campaigning, [0] took office as vice president in March 1901. vice president was a powerless sinecure and did not suit [0]'s aggressive temperament. [0]'s six months as vice president were uneventful and boring for a man of action. [0] had no power; [0] presided over the Senate for a mere four days before the Senate adjourned. On September 2, 1901, [0] first publicized an aphorism that thrilled [0]'s supporters: \"Speak softly and carry a big stick, and you will go far.\"", "": ""}, "Presidency (1901\u20131909)": {"": "Theodore Roosevelt is our person to focus on. On September 6, 1901, [0] was attending the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York, when [0] was shot by anarchist Leon Czolgosz. Theodore Roosevelt was vacationing in Isle La Motte, Vermont, and traveled to Buffalo, New York, to visit [0] in the hospital. It appeared that [0] would recover, so Theodore Roosevelt resumed Theodore Roosevelt's vacation in the Adirondack Mountains. When [0]'s condition worsened, Theodore Roosevelt again rushed back to Buffalo, New York,. [0] died on September 14, and Theodore Roosevelt was informed while Theodore Roosevelt was in North Creek; Theodore Roosevelt continued on to Buffalo, New York, and was sworn in as the nation's 26th president at the Ansley Wilcox House.[0]'s supporters were nervous about Theodore Roosevelt, and Ohio Senator Mark Hanna was particularly bitter that Theodore Roosevelt Ohio Senator Mark Hanna had succeeded [0]. Theodore Roosevelt assured party leaders that Theodore Roosevelt intended to adhere to [0]'s policies, and Theodore Roosevelt retained [0]'s Cabinet. Nonetheless, Theodore Roosevelt sought to position Theodore Roosevelt as the party's undisputed leader, seeking to bolster the role of the president and position Theodore Roosevelt for the 1904 election.Shortly after taking office, Theodore Roosevelt invited Booker T. Washington to dinner at the White House. invited sparked a bitter, and at times vicious, reaction among whites across the heavily segregated South. Theodore Roosevelt reacted with astonishment and protest, saying that Theodore Roosevelt looked forward to many future dinners with Booker T. Washington. Upon further reflection, Theodore Roosevelt wanted to ensure that invited had no effect on political support in the heavily segregated South, and further dinner invitations to Booker T. Washington were avoided; their next meeting was scheduled as typical business at 10:00\u00a0a.m. instead.", "Domestic policies: The Square Deal": "[0] is our person to focus on. For [0]'s aggressive use of the 1890 Sherman Antitrust Act, compared to [0]'s predecessors, [0] was hailed as the \"trust-buster\". [0] viewed big business as a necessary part of the American economy and sought only to prosecute the \"bad trusts\" that restrained trade and charged unfair prices. [0] brought 44 antitrust suits, breaking up the Northern Securities Company, the largest railroad monopoly; and regulating Standard Oil, the largest oil company. Presidents Benjamin Harrison, Grover Cleveland, and William McKinley combined had prosecuted only 18 antitrust violations under the 1890 Sherman Antitrust Act.Bolstered by [0]'s party's winning large majorities in the 1902 elections, [0] proposed the creation of the United States Department of Commerce and Labor, which would include the Bureau of Corporations. While Congress was receptive to the United States Department of Commerce and Labor, which would include the Bureau of Corporations, Congress was more skeptical of the antitrust powers that [0] sought to endow within the Bureau of Corporations. [0] successfully appealed to the public to pressure Congress, and Congress overwhelmingly voted to pass [0]'s version of the bill.In a moment of frustration, House Speaker Joseph Gurney Cannon commented on [0]'s desire for executive branch control in domestic policymaking: \"[0] wants everything from the birth of Christ to the death of the devil.\" Biographer Brands states, \"Even [0]'s friends occasionally wondered whether there wasn't any custom or practice too minor for [0] to try to regulate, update or otherwise improve.\" In fact, [0]'s willingness to exercise [0]'s power included attempted rule changes in the game of football; at the U.S. Naval Academy, [0] sought to force retention of martial arts classes and to revise disciplinary rules. [0] even ordered changes made in the minting of a coin whose design [0] disliked and ordered the Government Printing Office to adopt simplified spellings for a core list of 300 words, according to reformers on the Simplified Spelling Board. [0] was forced to rescind ordered after substantial ridicule from the press and a resolution of protest from the U.S. House of Representatives.In May 1902, anthracite coal miners went on strike, threatening a national energy shortage. After threatening the coal operators with intervention by federal troops, [0] won their agreement to dispute arbitration by a commission, which succeeded in stopping the strike. their agreement to dispute arbitration by a commission, which succeeded in stopping the strike resulted in anthracite coal miners getting more pay for fewer hours, but with no union recognition. [0] said, \"[0]'s action on labor should always be considered in connection with [0]'s action as regards capital, and both are reducible to [0]'s favorite formula\u2014a square deal for every man.\" [0] was the first president to help settle a labor dispute.During [0]'s second year in office, it was discovered there was corruption in the Indian Service, the Land Office, and the Post Office Department. [0] investigated and prosecuted corrupt Indian agents who had cheated the Creeks and various Native American tribes out of land parcels. Land fraud and speculation were found involving Oregon federal timberlands. In November 1902, [0] and Secretary Ethan A. Hitchcock forced Binger Hermann, the the Land Office Commissioner, to resign from office. On November 6, 1903, Francis J. Heney was appointed special prosecutor and obtained 146 indictments involving an Oregon bribery ring. U.S. Senator John H. Mitchell was indicted for bribery to expedite illegal land patents, found guilty in July 1905, and sentenced to six months in prison. More corruption was found in the Post Office Department, that brought on the indictments of 44 government employees on charges of bribery and fraud. Historians generally agree that [0] moved \"quickly and decisively\" to prosecute misconduct in [0]'s administration.Merchants complained that some railroad rates were too high. In the 1906 Hepburn Act, [0] sought to give the Interstate Commerce Commission the power to regulate rates, but the Senate, led by conservative Nelson Aldrich, fought back. [0] worked with the Democratic Senator Benjamin Tillman to pass the 1906 Hepburn Act. [0] and conservative Nelson Aldrich ultimately reached a compromise that gave the Interstate Commerce Commission the power to replace existing rates with \"just-and-reasonable\" maximum rates, but allowed railroads to appeal to the federal courts on what was \"reasonable\". In addition to rate-setting, the 1906 Hepburn Act also granted the Interstate Commerce Commission regulatory power over pipeline fees, storage contracts, and several other aspects of railroad operations.[0] responded to public anger over the abuses in the food packing industry by pushing Congress to pass the Meat Inspection Act of 1906 and the Pure Food and Drug Act. Though conservatives initially opposed the Meat Inspection Act of 1906 and the Pure Food and Drug Act, Upton Sinclair's The Jungle, published in 1906, helped galvanize support for reform. the Meat Inspection Act of 1906 banned misleading labels and preservatives that contained harmful chemicals. the Pure Food and Drug Act banned food and drugs that were impure or falsely labeled from being made, sold, and shipped. [0] also served as honorary president of the American School Hygiene Association from 1907 to 1908, and in 1909 [0] convened the first White House Conference on the Care of Dependent Children.Of all [0]'s achievements, [0] was proudest of [0]'s work in the conservation of natural resources and extending federal protection to land and wildlife. [0] worked closely with Interior Secretary James Rudolph Garfield and Chief of the United States Forest Service Gifford Pinchot to enact a series of conservation programs that often met with resistance from Western members of Congress, such as Charles William Fulton. Nonetheless, [0] established the United States Forest Service, signed into law the creation of five National Parks, and signed the 1906 Antiquities Act, under which [0] proclaimed 18 new U.S. National Monuments. [0] also established the first 51 bird reserves, four game preserves, and 150 National Forests. The area of the United States that [0] placed under public protection totals approximately 230\u00a0million acres (930,000 square kilometers). In part due to [0]'s dedication to conservation, [0] was voted in as the first honorary member of the Camp-Fire Club of America.[0] extensively used executive orders on a number of occasions to protect forest and wildlife lands during [0]'s tenure as president. By the end of [0]'s second term in office, [0] used executive orders to establish 150\u00a0million acres (600,000 square kilometers) of reserved forestry land. [0] was unapologetic about [0]'s extensive use of executive orders to protect the environment, despite the perception in Congress that [0] was encroaching on too many lands. Eventually, Charles William Fulton attached an amendment to an agricultural appropriations bill that effectively prevented [0] from reserving any further land. Before signing an agricultural appropriations bill into law, [0] used executive orders to establish an additional 21 forest reserves, waiting until the last minute to sign an agricultural appropriations bill into law. In total, [0] used executive orders to establish 121 forest reserves in 31 states. Prior to [0], only one president had issued over 200 executive orders, Grover Cleveland (253). The first 25 presidents issued a total of 1,262 executive orders; [0] issued 1,081.In 1907, [0] faced the greatest domestic economic crisis since the Panic of 1893. Wall Street's stock market entered a slump in early 1907, and many investors blamed [0]'s regulatory policies for a slump. [0] helped calm the greatest domestic economic crisis since the Panic of 1893 by meeting on November 4, 1907, with the leaders of U.S. Steel and approving the leaders of U.S. Steel's plan to purchase a Tennessee steel company near bankruptcy\u2014a Tennessee steel company near bankruptcy's failure would ruin a major New York bank. [0] thus approved the growth of U.S. Steel, while the public announcement calmed the markets.[0] exploded in anger at the super-rich for the economic malfeasance, calling the super-rich \"malefactors of great wealth\". in a major speech in August entitled, \"The Puritan Spirit and the Regulation of Corporations\". Trying to restore confidence, [0] blamed the greatest domestic economic crisis since the Panic of 1893 primarily on Europe, but then, after saluting the unbending rectitude of the Puritans, [0] went on:  It may well be that the determination of the United States...to punish certain malefactors of great wealth, has been responsible for something of the greatest domestic economic crisis since the Panic of 1893; at least to the extent of having caused certain malefactors of great wealth to combine to bring about as much financial stress as possible, in order to discredit the policy of the government and thereby secure a reversal of the policy of the government, so that certain malefactors of great wealth may enjoy unmolested the fruits of certain malefactors of great wealth's own evil-doing. Regarding the very wealthy, [0] privately scorned, \"...the very wealthy's entire unfitness to govern the United States, and ... the lasting damage the very wealthy do by much of what the very wealthy think are the legitimate big business operations of the day\".", "Foreign policy": "Theodore Roosevelt is our person to focus on. The American annexation of [0] in 1898 was stimulated in part by fear that otherwise Japan would dominate or seize [0]. Similarly, Germany was the alternative to American takeover of the Philippines in 1900, and Tokyo strongly preferred the U.S. to take over. As the U.S. became a naval world power, the U.S. needed to find a way to avoid a military confrontation in the Pacific with Japan.In the 1890s, Theodore Roosevelt had been an ardent imperialist and vigorously defended the permanent acquisition of the Philippines in the 1900 campaign. After the local insurrection ended in 1902, Theodore Roosevelt wished to have a strong U.S. presence in the Pacific as a symbol of democratic values, but Theodore Roosevelt did not envision any new acquisitions. One of Theodore Roosevelt's priorities during his presidency and afterwards, was the maintenance of friendly relations with Japan. From 1904 to 1905 Japan and Russia were at war. Japan and Russia asked Theodore Roosevelt to mediate a peace conference, held successfully in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Theodore Roosevelt won the Nobel Peace Prize for Theodore Roosevelt's efforts.Though Theodore Roosevelt proclaimed that the U.S. would be neutral during the Russo-Japanese War, Theodore Roosevelt secretly favored Japan to emerge victorious against Russia. Theodore Roosevelt wanted the influence of Russia to weaken in order to take Russia out in the the Pacific diplomatic equation, with the Japanese emerging to the Japanese's spot as the Russian replacement.In California, anti-Japanese hostility was growing, and Tokyo protested. Theodore Roosevelt negotiated a \"Gentleman's Agreement\" in 1907. a \"Gentleman's Agreement\" ended explicit discrimination against the Japanese, and Japan agreed not to allow unskilled immigrants into the U.S.. The Great White Fleet of American battleships visited Japan in 1908 during The Great White Fleet of American battleships's round-the-world tour. Theodore Roosevelt intended to emphasize the superiority of The Great White Fleet of American battleships over the smaller Japanese navy, but instead of resentment The Great White Fleet of American battleships arrived to a joyous welcome by Japanese elite as well as the general public. This good-will facilitated the Root\u2013Takahira Agreement of 1908 which reaffirmed the status quo of Japanese control of Korea and American control of the Philippines.Success in the war against Spain and the new empire, plus having the largest economy in the world, meant that the U.S. had emerged as a world power. Theodore Roosevelt searched for ways to win recognition for the position abroad.Theodore Roosevelt also played a major role in mediating the First Moroccan Crisis by calling the Algeciras Conference, which averted war between France and Germany.his presidency saw the strengthening of ties with Great Britain. The Great Rapprochement had begun with British support of the U.S. during the Russo-Japanese War, and The Great Rapprochement continued as Great Britain withdrew Great Britain's fleet from the Caribbean in favor of focusing on the rising German naval threat. In 1901, Japan and Russia signed the Hay\u2013Pauncefote Treaty, abrogating the Clayton\u2013Bulwer Treaty, which had prevented the U.S. from constructing a canal connecting the Pacific and the Atlantic Ocean. The long-standing Alaska boundary dispute was settled on terms favorable to the U.S., as Great Britain was unwilling to alienate the U.S. over what Great Britain considered to be a secondary issue. As Theodore Roosevelt later put it, settled The long-standing Alaska boundary dispute \"settled the last serious trouble between Russia and the U.S..\"As president, Theodore Roosevelt primarily focused the U.S.'s overseas ambitions on the Caribbean, especially locations that had a bearing on the defense of his pet project, the Panama Canal. Theodore Roosevelt also increased the size of the navy, and by the end of Theodore Roosevelt's second term the U.S. had more battleships than any other country besides Great Britain. his pet project, the Panama Canal, when his pet project, the Panama Canal opened in 1914, allowed the navy to rapidly move back and forth from the Pacific to the Caribbean to European waters.In December 1902, the Germans, British, and Italians blockaded the ports of Venezuela in order to force the repayment of delinquent loans. Theodore Roosevelt was particularly concerned with the motives of German Emperor Wilhelm II. Theodore Roosevelt succeeded in getting the Germans, British, and Italians to agree to arbitration by tribunal at The Hague, and successfully defused the crisis. The latitude granted to the Europeans by the arbiters was in part responsible for the \"Theodore Roosevelt Corollary\" to the Monroe Doctrine, which the President issued in 1904: \"Chronic wrongdoing or an impotence which results in a general loosening of the ties of civilized society, may in the U.S., as elsewhere, ultimately require intervention by some civilized nation, and in the Western Hemisphere, the adherence of the U.S. to the Monroe Doctrine, which the President issued in 1904 may force the U.S., however reluctantly, in flagrant cases of such wrongdoing or impotence, to the exercise of an international police power.\"The pursuit of an isthmus canal in Central America during this period focused on two possible routes\u2014Nicaragua and Panama, which was then a rebellious district within Colombia. Theodore Roosevelt convinced Congress to approve the Panamanian alternative, and a treaty was approved, only to be rejected by Russia. When the Panamanians learned of rejected, a rebellion followed, was supported by Theodore Roosevelt, and succeeded. A treaty with the new Panama government for construction of the canal was then reached in 1903. Theodore Roosevelt received criticism for paying the bankrupt Panama Canal Company and the New Panama Canal Company $40,000,000 (equivalent to $13.03\u00a0billion in 2022) for the rights and equipment to build an isthmus canal. Critics charged that an American investor syndicate allegedly divided $40,000,000 (equivalent to $13.03\u00a0billion in 2022) among an American investor syndicate. There was also controversy over whether a French company engineer influenced Theodore Roosevelt in choosing the Panamanian alternative Panama, which was then a rebellious district within Colombia over the Nicaragua route. Theodore Roosevelt denied charges of corruption concerning an isthmus canal in a January 8, 1906, message to Congress. In January 1909, Theodore Roosevelt, in an unprecedented move, brought criminal libel charges against the New York World and the Indianapolis News known as the \"Roosevelt-Panama Libel Cases\"Panama, which was then a rebellious district within Colombia . the \"Roosevelt-Panama Libel Cases\" were dismissed by U.S. District Courts, and on January 3, 1911, the U.S. Supreme Court, upon federal appeal, upheld U.S. District Courts's rulings. Historians are sharply critical of Theodore Roosevelt's criminal prosecutions of the New York World and the Indianapolis News but are divided on whether actual corruption in acquiring and building his pet project, the Panama Canal took place.In 1906, following a disputed election, an insurrection ensued in Cuba; Theodore Roosevelt sent Taft, the Secretary of War, to monitor the situation; Theodore Roosevelt was convinced that Theodore Roosevelt had the authority to unilaterally authorize Taft, the Secretary of War, to deploy Marines, if necessary, without congressional approval.Examining the work of numerous scholars, Ricard (2014) reports that:The most striking evolution in the twenty-first-century historiography of Theodore Roosevelt is the switch from a partial arraignment of the imperialist to a quasi-unanimous celebration of Theodore Roosevelt.... [Recent works] have underlined cogently Theodore Roosevelt's exceptional statesmanship in the construction of the nascent twentieth-century \"special relationship\". ...Theodore Roosevelt's reputation as a brilliant diplomatist and real politician has undeniably reached new heights in the twenty-first century...yet, Theodore Roosevelt's Philippine policy still prompts criticism. On November 6, 1906, Theodore Roosevelt was the first president to depart the U.S. on an official diplomatic trip. Theodore Roosevelt made a 17-day trip to Panama, which was then a rebellious district within Colombia and Puerto Rico. Theodore Roosevelt checked on the progress of construction of the canal and talked to workers about the importance of construction of the canal. In Puerto Rico, Theodore Roosevelt recommended that Puerto Ricans become U.S. citizens.", "Media": "[0] is our person to focus on. Building on McKinley's effective use of the press, [0] made the White House the center of news every day, providing interviews and photo opportunities. After noticing the reporters huddled outside the White House in the rain one day, [0] gave the reporters the reporters's own room inside, effectively inventing the presidential press briefing. The grateful press, with unprecedented access to the White House, rewarded [0] with ample coverage.[0] normally enjoyed very close relationships with the press, which [0] used to keep in daily contact with [0]'s middle-class base. While out of office, [0] made a living as a writer and magazine editor. [0] loved talking with intellectuals, authors, and writers. [0] drew the line, however, at expos\u00e9-oriented scandal-mongering journalists who, during his term, sent magazine subscriptions soaring by their attacks on corrupt politicians, mayors, and corporations. [0] was not usually a target, but a speech of [0] from 1906 coined the term \"muckraker\" for unscrupulous journalists making wild charges. \"The liar\", [0] said, \"is no whit better than the thief, and if The liar's mendacity takes the form of slander The liar may be worse than most thieves.\"The press did briefly target [0] in one instance. After 1904, [0] was periodically criticized for the manner in which [0] facilitated the construction of the Panama Canal. According to biographer Brands, [0], near the end of his term, demanded that the U.S. Justice Department bring charges of criminal libel against Joseph Pulitzer's New York World. Joseph Pulitzer's New York World had accused Joseph Pulitzer's of \"deliberate misstatements of fact\" in defense of family members who were criticized as a result of the Panama affair. Though an indictment was obtained, the case was ultimately dismissed in federal court\u2014criminal libel was not a federal offense, but one enforceable in state courts. the U.S. Justice Department had predicted dismissed and had also advised [0] accordingly.", "Election of 1904": "[0] is our person to focus on. The control and management of the Republican Party lay in the hands of Ohio Senator and Republican Party chairman Mark Hanna until McKinley's death. [0] and Ohio Senator and Republican Party chairman Mark Hanna frequently cooperated during [0]'s first term, but Ohio Senator and Republican Party chairman Mark Hanna left open the possibility of a challenge to [0] for the 1904 Republican nomination. [0] and Ohio's other Senator, Joseph B. Foraker, forced Ohio Senator and Republican Party chairman Mark Hanna's hand by calling for Ohio's state Republican convention to endorse [0] for the 1904 Republican nomination. Unwilling to break with the president, Ohio Senator and Republican Party chairman Mark Hanna was forced to publicly endorse [0]. Ohio Senator and Republican Party chairman Mark Hanna and Pennsylvania Senator Matthew Quay both died in early 1904, and with the waning of Thomas Platt's power, [0] faced little effective opposition for the 1904 Republican nomination. In deference to Ohio Senator and Republican Party chairman Mark Hanna's conservative loyalists, [0] at first offered the party chairmanship to Cornelius Bliss, but Cornelius Bliss declined. [0] turned to his own man, George B. Cortelyou of New York, the first Secretary of Commerce and Labor. To buttress [0]'s hold on the 1904 Republican nomination, [0] made it clear that anyone opposing his own man, George B. Cortelyou of New York, the first Secretary of Commerce and Labor would be considered to be opposing [0]. [0] secured [0]'s own nomination, but [0]'s preferred vice-presidential running mate, Robert R. Hitt, was not nominated. Senator Charles Warren Fairbanks of Indiana, a favorite of conservatives, gained the nomination.While [0] followed the tradition of incumbents in not actively campaigning on the stump, [0] sought to control the campaign's message through specific instructions to his own man, George B. Cortelyou of New York, the first Secretary of Commerce and Labor. [0] also attempted to manage the press's release of White House statements by forming the Ananias Club. Any journalist who repeated a statement made by the president without approval was penalized by restriction of further access.The Democratic Party's's nominee in 1904 was Alton Brooks Parker. Democratic newspapers charged that Republicans were extorting large campaign contributions from corporations, putting ultimate responsibility on [0]. [0] denied corruption while at the same time [0] ordered his own man, George B. Cortelyou of New York, the first Secretary of Commerce and Labor to return $100,000 (equivalent to $3.3\u00a0million in 2022) of a campaign contribution from Standard Oil. Alton Brooks Parker said that [0] was accepting corporate donations to keep damaging information from the Bureau of Corporations from going public. [0] strongly denied Alton Brooks Parker's charge and responded that [0] would \"go into the Presidency unhampered by any pledge, promise, or understanding of any kind, sort, or description...\". Allegations from Alton Brooks Parker and The Democratic Party's, however, had little impact on the election, as [0] promised to give every American a \"square deal\". [0] won 56% of the popular vote, and Alton Brooks Parker received 38%; [0] also won the Electoral College vote, 336 to 140. Before [0]'s inauguration ceremony, [0] declared that [0] would not serve another term. Democrats afterwards would continue to charge [0] and the Republican Party of being influenced by corporate donations during [0]'s second term.", "Second term": "[0] is our person to focus on. As his second term progressed, [0] moved to the left of [0]'s Republican Party base and called for a series of reforms, most of which Congress failed to pass. In [0]'s last year in office, [0] was assisted by [0]'s friend Archibald Butt (who later perished in the sinking of RMS Titanic). [0]'s influence waned as [0] approached the end of his second term, as [0]'s promise to forego a third term made [0] a lame duck and [0]'s concentration of power provoked a backlash from many Congressmen. [0] sought a national incorporation law (at a time when all corporations had state charters), called for a federal income tax (despite the Supreme Court's ruling in Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co.), and an inheritance tax. In the area of labor legislation, [0] called for limits on the use of court injunctions against labor unions during strikes; injunctions were a powerful weapon that mostly helped business. [0] wanted an employee liability law for industrial injuries (pre-empting state laws) and an eight-hour work day for federal employees. In other areas [0] also sought a postal savings system (to provide competition for local banks), and [0] asked for campaign reform laws.The election of 1904 continued to be a source of contention between Republicans and Democrats. A Congressional investigation in 1905 revealed that corporate executives donated tens of thousands of dollars in 1904 to the Republican National Committee. In 1908, a month before the general presidential election, Governor Charles N. Haskell of Oklahoma, former Democratic Treasurer, said that Senators beholden to Standard Oil lobbied [0], in the summer of 1904, to authorize the leasing of Indian oil lands by Standard Oil subsidiaries. Governor Charles N. Haskell of Oklahoma, former Democratic Treasurer, said [0] overruled his Secretary of the Interior Ethan A. Hitchcock and granted a pipeline franchise to run through the Osage lands to the Prairie Oil and Gas Company. The New York Sun made a similar accusation and said that Standard Oil had contributed $150,000 to the Republicans in 1904 (equivalent to $4.9\u00a0million in 2022) after [0]'s a pipeline franchise to run through the Osage lands. [0] branded Governor Charles N. Haskell of Oklahoma, former Democratic Treasurer,'s as \"a lie, pure and simple\" and obtained a denial from his Secretary of the Interior Ethan A. Hitchcock that [0] had neither coerced his Secretary of the Interior Ethan A. Hitchcock nor overruled his Secretary of the Interior Ethan A. Hitchcock.[0]'s rhetoric was characterized by an intense moralism of personal righteousness. an intense moralism of personal righteousness was typified by [0]'s denunciation of \"predatory wealth\" in a message [0] sent Congress in January 1908 calling for passage of new labor laws:  Predatory wealth--of the wealth accumulated on a giant scale by all forms of iniquity, ranging from the oppression of wageworkers to unfair and unwholesome methods of crushing out competition, and to defrauding the public by stock jobbing and the manipulation of securities. Certain wealthy men of this stamp, whose conduct should be abhorrent to every man of ordinarily decent conscience, and who commit the hideous wrong of teaching our young men that phenomenal business success must ordinarily be based on dishonesty, have during the last few months made it apparent that they have banded together to work for a reaction. they's endeavor is to overthrow and discredit all who honestly administer the law, to prevent any additional legislation which would check and restrain they, and to secure if possible a freedom from all restraint which will permit every unscrupulous wrongdoer to do what every unscrupulous wrongdoer wishes unchecked provided every unscrupulous wrongdoer has enough money....The methods by which the Standard Oil people and those engaged in the other combinations of which [0] have spoken above have achieved great fortunes can only be justified by the advocacy of a system of morality which would also justify every form of criminality on the part of a labor union, and every form of violence, corruption, and fraud, from murder to bribery and ballot box stuffing in politics.  "}, "Post-presidency (1909\u20131919)": {"Election of 1908": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] enjoyed being president and was still relatively youthful but felt that a limited number of terms provided a check against dictatorship. [0] ultimately decided to stick to [0]'s 1904 pledge not to run for a third term. [0] personally favored Secretary of State Elihu Root as [0]'s successor, but Secretary of State Elihu Root's ill health made Secretary of State Elihu Root an unsuitable candidate. New York Governor Charles Evans Hughes loomed as a potentially strong candidate and shared [0]'s progressivism, but [0] disliked New York Governor Charles Evans Hughes and considered New York Governor Charles Evans Hughes to be too independent. Instead, [0] settled on his Secretary of War, William Howard Taft, who had ably served under Presidents Harrison, McKinley, and Roosevelt in various positions. [0] and his Secretary of War, William Howard Taft, who had ably served under Presidents Harrison, McKinley, and Roosevelt in various positions had been friends since 1890, and his Secretary of War, William Howard Taft, who had ably served under Presidents Harrison, McKinley, and Roosevelt in various positions had consistently supported [0]'s policies. [0] was determined to install the successor of [0]'s choice, and wrote the following to his Secretary of War, William Howard Taft, who had ably served under Presidents Harrison, McKinley, and Roosevelt in various positions: \"his Secretary of War, William Howard Taft, who had ably served under Presidents Harrison, McKinley, and Roosevelt in various positions: Do his Secretary of War, William Howard Taft, who had ably served under Presidents Harrison, McKinley, and Roosevelt in various positions want any action about those federal officials? [0] will break those federal officials's necks with the utmost cheerfulness if his Secretary of War, William Howard Taft, who had ably served under Presidents Harrison, McKinley, and Roosevelt in various positions say the word!\". Just weeks later [0] branded as \"false and malicious\" the charge that [0] was using the offices at [0]'s disposal to favor his Secretary of War, William Howard Taft, who had ably served under Presidents Harrison, McKinley, and Roosevelt in various positions. At the 1908 Republican convention, many chanted for \"four years more\" of a [0] presidency, but his Secretary of War, William Howard Taft, who had ably served under Presidents Harrison, McKinley, and Roosevelt in various positions won the nomination after Henry Cabot Lodge made it clear that [0] was not interested in a third term.In the 1908 election, his Secretary of War, William Howard Taft, who had ably served under Presidents Harrison, McKinley, and Roosevelt in various positions easily defeated the Democratic nominee, three-time candidate William Jennings Bryan. his Secretary of War, William Howard Taft, who had ably served under Presidents Harrison, McKinley, and Roosevelt in various positions promoted a progressivism that stressed the rule of law; his Secretary of War, William Howard Taft, who had ably served under Presidents Harrison, McKinley, and Roosevelt in various positions preferred that judges rather than administrators or politicians make the basic decisions about fairness. his Secretary of War, William Howard Taft, who had ably served under Presidents Harrison, McKinley, and Roosevelt in various positions usually proved to be a less adroit politician than [0] and lacked the energy and personal magnetism, along with the publicity devices, the dedicated supporters, and the broad base of public support that made [0] so formidable. When [0] realized that lowering the tariff would risk creating severe tensions inside the Republican Party by pitting producers (manufacturers, industrial workers, and farmers) against merchants and consumers, [0] stopped talking about the issue. his Secretary of War, William Howard Taft, who had ably served under Presidents Harrison, McKinley, and Roosevelt in various positions ignored the risks and tackled the tariff boldly, encouraging reformers to fight for lower rates, and then cutting deals with conservative leaders that kept overall rates high. the tariff his Secretary of War, William Howard Taft, who had ably served under Presidents Harrison, McKinley, and Roosevelt in various positions's was too high for most reformers, and his Secretary of War, William Howard Taft, who had ably served under Presidents Harrison, McKinley, and Roosevelt in various positions's handling of the tariff alienated all sides. While the crisis was building inside the Republican Party, [0] was touring Africa and Europe, to allow his Secretary of War, William Howard Taft, who had ably served under Presidents Harrison, McKinley, and Roosevelt in various positions space to be his Secretary of War, William Howard Taft, who had ably served under Presidents Harrison, McKinley, and Roosevelt in various positions's own man.", "Africa and Europe (1909\u20131910)": "[0] is our person to focus on. In March 1909, [0] left the country for the Smithsonian-Roosevelt African Expedition, a safari in east and central Africa. Roosevelt's party landed in Mombasa, East Africa (now Kenya) and traveled to the Belgian Congo (now Democratic Republic of the Congo) before following the Nile River to Khartoum in modern Sudan. Well-financed by Andrew Carnegie and by [0]'s own writings, Roosevelt's party hunted for specimens for the Smithsonian Institution and for the American Museum of Natural History in New York. The group, led by the hunter-tracker R.J. Cunninghame, included scientists from the Smithsonian Institution, and was joined from time to time by Frederick Selous, the famous big game hunter and explorer. Participants on the Smithsonian-Roosevelt African Expedition, a safari in east and central Africa included Kermit Roosevelt, Edgar Alexander Mearns, Edmund Heller, and John Alden Loring.Roosevelt's party killed or trapped 11,400 animals, from insects and moles to hippopotamuses and elephants. 11,400 animals included 512 big game animals, including six rare white rhinos. Tons of salted carcases and skins were shipped to Washington; it took years to mount Tons of salted carcases and skins, and the Smithsonian Institution shared duplicate specimens with other museums. Regarding the large number of animals taken, [0] said, \"[0] can be condemned only if the existence of the National Museum, the American Museum of Natural History in New York, and all similar zoological institutions are to be condemned\". [0] wrote a detailed account of the Smithsonian-Roosevelt African Expedition, a safari in east and central Africa in the book African Game Trails, recounting the excitement of the chase, the people [0] met, and the flora and fauna [0] collected in the name of science.After the Smithsonian-Roosevelt African Expedition, a safari in east and central Africa, [0] traveled north to embark on a tour of Europe. Stopping first in Egypt, [0] commented favorably on British rule of Egypt, giving [0]'s opinion that Egypt was not yet ready for independence. [0] refused a meeting with the Pope due to a dispute over a group of Methodists active in Rome. [0] met with Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria-Hungary, Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, King George V of Great Britain, and other European leaders. In Oslo, Norway, [0] delivered a speech calling for limitations on naval armaments, a strengthening of the Permanent Court of Arbitration, and the creation of a \"League of Peace\" among the world powers. [0] also delivered the Romanes Lecture at Oxford, in which [0] denounced those who sought parallels between the evolution of animal life and the development of society. Though [0] attempted to avoid domestic politics, [0] quietly met with Gifford Pinchot, who related his own disappointment with the Taft Administration. Gifford Pinchot, who related his own disappointment with the Taft Administration had been forced to resign as head of the forest service after clashing with Taft's Interior Secretary, Richard Ballinger, who had prioritized development over conservation. [0] returned to the United States in June 1910 where [0] was shortly thereafter honored with a reception luncheon on the roof of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York hosted by the Camp-Fire Club of America, of which [0] was a member.In October 1910, [0] became the first U.S. president to fly in an airplane, staying aloft for four minutes in a Wright Brothers-designed craft near St. Louis, Missouri.", "Republican Party schism": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] had attempted to refashion Taft into a copy of [0], but [0] recoiled as Taft began to display Taft's individuality. [0] was offended on election night when Taft indicated that Taft's success had been possible not just through the efforts of [0], but also Taft's half-brother Charles P. Taft. [0] was further alienated when Taft, intent on becoming Taft's own man, did not consult [0] about cabinet appointments. [0] and other progressives were ideologically dissatisfied over Taft's conservation policies and Taft's handling of the tariff when Taft concentrated more power in the hands of conservative party leaders in Congress. Stanley Solvick argues that as Taft abided by the goals and procedures of the \"Square Deal\" promoted by [0] in Taft's first term. The problem was that [0] and the more radical progressives had moved on to more aggressive goals, such as curbing the judiciary, which Taft rejected. Regarding radicalism and liberalism, [0] wrote a British friend in 1911:[0] urged progressives to take control of the Republican Party at the state and local level and to avoid splitting the Republican Party in a way that would hand the presidency to the Democrats in 1912. To that end [0] publicly expressed optimism about the Taft Administration after meeting with Taft in June 1910.In August 1910, [0] escalated the rivalry with a speech at Osawatomie, Kansas, which was the most radical of his career. a speech at Osawatomie, Kansas, which was the most radical of his career marked [0]'s public break with Taft and the conservative Republicans. Advocating a program [0] called the \"New Nationalism\", [0] emphasized the priority of labor over capital interests, and the need to control corporate creation and combination. [0] called for a ban on corporate political contributions. Returning to New York, [0] began a battle to take control of the Republican Party from William Barnes Jr., Tom Platt's successor as the state party boss. Taft had pledged Taft's support to [0] in take, and [0] was outraged when Taft's support failed to materialize at the 1910 state convention. [0] campaigned for the Republican Party in the 1910 elections, in which the Democrats gained control of the House for the first time since 1892. Among the newly elected Democrats was New York state senator Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who argued that [0] represented [0]'s distant cousin's policies better than [0]'s Republican opponent.The Republican progressives interpreted the 1910 defeats as a compelling argument for the complete reorganization of the Republican Party in 1911. Senator Robert M. La Follette of Wisconsin joined with Pinchot, William White, and California Governor Hiram Johnson to create the National Progressive Republican League; their objectives were to defeat the power of political bossism at the state level and to replace Taft at the national level. Despite [0]'s skepticism of Senator Robert M. La Follette of Wisconsin's , [0] expressed general support for progressive principles. Between January and April 1911, [0] wrote a series of articles for The Outlook, defending what [0] called \"the great movement of our day, the progressive nationalist movement against special privilege, and in favor of an honest and efficient political and industrial democracy\". With [0] apparently uninterested in running in 1912, Senator Robert M. La Follette of Wisconsin declared Senator Robert M. La Follette of Wisconsin's own candidacy in June 1911. [0] continually criticized Taft after the 1910 defeats, and the break between the two men became final after the Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit against US Steel in September 1911; [0] was humiliated by an antitrust lawsuit because [0] had personally approved of an acquisition that the Justice Department was now challenging. However, [0] was still unwilling to run against Taft in 1912; [0] instead hoped to run in 1916 against whichever Democrat beat Taft in Taft was world leader for arbitration as a guarantee of world peace. In 1911 Taft and his Secretary of State Philander C. Knox negotiated major treaties with Great Britain and France providing that differences be arbitrated. Disputes had to be submitted to the Hague Court or another tribunal. major treaties with Great Britain and France providing that differences be arbitrated were signed in August 1911 but had to be ratified by a two-thirds vote of the Senate. Neither Taft nor his Secretary of State Philander C. Knox consulted with leaders of the Senate during the negotiating process. By then many Republicans were opposed to Taft, and the president felt that lobbying too hard for major treaties with Great Britain and France providing that differences be arbitrated might cause major treaties with Great Britain and France providing that differences be arbitrated's defeat. Taft made some speeches supporting major treaties with Great Britain and France providing that differences be arbitrated in October, but the Senate added amendments Taft could not accept, killing major treaties with Great Britain and France providing that differences be arbitrated.The arbitration issue revealed a deep philosophical dispute among American progressives. One faction, led by Taft looked to legal arbitration as the best alternative to warfare. Taft was a constitutional lawyer with a deep understanding of the legal issues. Taft's political base was the conservative business community that largely supported peace movements before 1914. However, Taft failed to mobilize the conservative business community that largely supported peace movements before 1914. the conservative business community that largely supported peace movements before 1914 believed that economic rivalries were the cause of war, and that extensive trade led to an interdependent world that would make war a very expensive and useless anachronism.However, an opposing faction of progressives, led by [0], ridiculed arbitration as foolhardy idealism, and insisted on the realism of warfare as the only solution to serious international disputes. [0] worked with his close friend Senator Henry Cabot Lodge to impose those amendments that ruined the goals of major treaties with Great Britain and France providing that differences be arbitrated. his close friend Senator Henry Cabot Lodge's motivation was that his close friend Senator Henry Cabot Lodge complained major treaties with Great Britain and France providing that differences be arbitrated impinged too much on senatorial prerogatives. [0], however, was acting to sabotage Taft's campaign promises. At a deeper level, [0] truly believed that arbitration was a na\u00efve solution and the great issues had to be decided by warfare. The Rooseveltian approach incorporated a near-mystical faith of the ennobling nature of war. The Rooseveltian approach endorsed jingoistic nationalism as opposed to the conservative business community that largely supported peace movements before 1914's calculation of profit and national interest.", "Election of 1912": "[0] is our's person to focus on. In November 1911, a group of Ohio Republicans endorsed [0] for the party's nomination for president; a group of Ohio Republicans included James R. Garfield and Dan Hanna. endorsed was made by leaders of President Taft's's . [0] conspicuously declined to make a statement\u2014requested by James R. Garfield\u2014that [0] would flatly refuse a nomination. Soon thereafter, [0] said, \"[0] am really sorry for President Taft's... [0] am sure President Taft's means well, but President Taft's means well feebly, and President Taft's does not know how! President Taft's is utterly unfit for leadership and this is a time when our need leadership.\" In January 1912, [0] declared \"if the people make a draft on [0] [0] shall not decline to serve\". Later that year, [0] spoke before the Constitutional Convention in Ohio, openly identifying as a progressive and endorsing progressive reforms\u2014even endorsing popular review of state judicial decisions. In reaction to [0]'s proposals for popular overrule of court decisions, President Taft's said, \"Such extremists are not progressives\u2014Such extremists are political emotionalists or neurotics\".[0] began to envision [0] as the savior of the party's from defeat in the upcoming presidential election. In February 1912, [0] announced in Boston, \"[0] will accept the party's nomination for president if the party's nomination for president is tendered to [0]. [0] hope that so far as possible the people may be given the chance through direct primaries to express who shall be the nominee. Elihu Root and Henry Cabot Lodge thought that division of the party's would lead to the party's's defeat in the upcoming presidential election, while President Taft's believed that President Taft's would be defeated either in the Republican primary or in the general election.direct primaries represented the first extensive use of the presidential primary, a reform achievement of the progressive movement. The Republican primaries in the South, where party regulars dominated, went for President Taft's, as did results in New York, Indiana, Michigan, Kentucky, and Massachusetts. Meanwhile, [0] won in Illinois, Minnesota, Nebraska, South Dakota, California, Maryland, and Pennsylvania. The greatest primary fight came in OhioPresident Taft's's . Both the President Taft's and [0] campaigns worked furiously, and La Follette joined in. Each team sent in big name speakers. [0]'s train went 1,800 miles back and forth in Ohio[0] . President Taft's's train went 3,000 miles criss-crossing Ohio and President Taft's made over 100 speeches.[0] swept Ohio, convincing [0] that [0] should intensify [0]'s campaigning, and letting President Taft's know President Taft's should work from the White House not the stump. Only a third of the states held primaries; elsewhere the state organization chose the delegations to the Constitutional Convention, and the state organization favored President Taft's. The final credentials of the state delegates at the Constitutional Convention were determined by the national committee, which was controlled by Taft men.Prior to the Constitutional Convention, [0] expressed doubt about [0]'s prospects for victory, noting that President Taft's had more delegates and control of the national committee, which was controlled by Taft men. [0]'s only hope was to convince party leaders that the party's nomination for president would hand the upcoming presidential election to the Democrats, but party leaders were determined not to cede party leaders's leadership to [0]. the national committee, which was controlled by Taft men awarded 235 contested delegates to President Taft's and 19 to [0]. President Taft's won the party's nomination for president on the first ballot with 561 votes against 107 for [0] and 41 for La Follette. Of 19[0] , 344 refused to vote so 344 would not be committed to the Republican ticket. Black delegates from the South played a key role: Black delegates from the South voted heavily for President Taft's and put President Taft's over the top. La Follette hoped that a deadlocked convention would result in La Follette's own nomination and refused to release La Follette's delegates to support [0].According to Lewis L. Gould, in 1912     [0] saw President Taft's as the agent of \"the forces of reaction and of political crookedness\".... [0] had become the most dangerous man in American history, said President Taft's, \"because of [0]'s hold upon the less intelligent voters and the discontented.\" the national committee, which was controlled by Taft men awarded 235 contested delegates to President Taft's and 19 to [0], thereby ensuring President Taft's's renomination. [0] believed [0] entitled to 72 delegates from Arizona, California, Texas and Washington that had been given to President Taft's. Firm in [0]'s conviction that the party's nomination for president was being stolen from [0], [0] ....told cheering supporters that there was \"a great moral issue\" at stake and [0] should have \"sixty to eighty lawfully elected delegates\" added to [0]'s total....[0] ended [0]'s speech declaring: \"Fearless of the future; unheeding of our's individual fates; with unflinching hearts and undimmed eyes; our stand at Armageddon, and our battle for the Lord!\"Once [0]'s defeat at the Constitutional Convention appeared probable, [0] announced that [0] would \"accept the party's nomination for president on a progressive platform and [0] shall fight to the end, win or lose\". At the same time, [0] prophetically said, \"[0]'s feeling is that the Democrats will probably win if the Democrats nominate a progressive\".[0] left the party's and created the Progressive Party, structuring the Progressive Party as a permanent organization that would field complete tickets at the presidential and state level. the Progressive Party included many reformers, including Jane Addams. Although many Republican politicians had announced for [0] before President Taft's won the party's nomination for president, [0] was stunned to discover that very few incumbent politicians followed [0] into the Progressive Party. The main exception was Californiathe party's. Loyalty to the party's was a powerful factor for incumbents; only five senators now supported [0]. Roosevelt's daughter Alice had a White House marriage to Congressman Nicholas Longworth, who represented Taft's base in Cincinnati. [0] reassured Congressman Nicholas Longworth, who represented Taft's base in Cincinnati in 1912 that of course [0] had to endorse President Taft's. However, Roosevelt's daughter Alice was Roosevelt's daughter Alice's biggest cheerleader\u2014the public conflict between spouses ruined a White House marriage.The leadership of the Progressive Party included a wide range of reformers. Jane Addams campaigned vigorously for the Progressive Party as a breakthrough in social reform. Gifford Pinchot represented the environmentalists and anti-trust crusaders. Publisher Frank Munsey provided much of the cash. George W. Perkins, a leading Wall Street financier and senior partner of J.P. Morgan bank came from the efficiency movement. George W. Perkins, a leading Wall Street financier and senior partner of J.P. Morgan bank handled the Progressive Party's finances efficiently but was deeply distrusted by many reformers.the Progressive Party was popularly known as the \"Bull Moose Party\" after [0] told reporters, \"[0]'m as fit as a bull moose\". At the Constitutional Convention, [0] cried out, \"our stand at Armageddon and our battle for the Lord.\" Governor Hiram Johnson controlled California, forcing out the President Taft's supporters. Governor Hiram Johnson was nominated as [0]'s running mate.[0]'s platform echoed [0]'s radical 1907\u20131908 proposals, calling for vigorous government intervention to protect the people from selfish interests:To destroy this invisible Government, to dissolve the unholy alliance between corrupt business and corrupt politics is the first task of the statesmanship of the day. This country belongs to the people. This country's resources, This country's business, This country's laws, This country's institutions, should be utilized, maintained, or altered in whatever manner will best promote the general interest. This assertion is explicit... Mr. Wilson must know that every monopoly in This country opposes the Progressive Party... [0] challenge Mr. Wilson... to name the monopoly that did support the Progressive party, whether... the Sugar Trust, the US Steel Trust, the Harvester Trust, the Standard Oil Trust, the Tobacco Trust, or any other... the Progressive Party was the only program to which the monopoly that did support the Progressive party objected, and the monopoly that did support the Progressive party supported either Mr. Wilson or President Taft's. Though many Progressive party activists in the North opposed the steady loss of civil rights for blacks, [0] ran a \"lily-white\" campaign in the South. Rival all-white and all-black delegations from four southern states arrived at the Constitutional Convention, and [0] decided to seat Rival all-white and all-black delegations from four southern states. Nevertheless, [0] won few votes outside a few traditional Republican strongholds. Out of 1,100 counties in the South, [0] won two counties in Alabama, one in Arkansas, seven in North Carolina, three in Georgia, 17 in Tennessee, two in Texas, one in Virginia, and none in Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, or South Carolina.On October 14, 1912, while arriving at a campaign event in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, [0] was shot from seven feet away in front of the Gilpatrick Hotel by a delusional saloonkeeper named John Flammang Schrank, who believed that the ghost of assassinated president William McKinley had directed him to kill Roosevelta delusional saloonkeeper named John Flammang Schrank, who believed that the ghost of assassinated president William McKinley had directed him to kill Roosevelt . The bullet lodged in [0]'s chest after penetrating [0]'s steel eyeglass case and passing through a 50-page-thick single-folded copy of the speech titled \"Progressive Cause Greater Than Any Individual\", which [0] was carrying in [0]'s jacket. [0] was immediately disarmed (by Czech immigrant Frank Bukovsky), captured, and might have been lynched had [0] not shouted for [0] to remain unharmed. [0] assured the crowd [0] was all right, then ordered police to take charge of [0] and to make sure no violence was done to [0].As an experienced hunter and anatomist, [0] correctly concluded that since [0] was not coughing blood, The bullet had not reached [0]'s lung. [0] declined suggestions to go to the hospital immediately and instead delivered a 90-minute speech with blood seeping into [0]'s shirt.[unreliable source?] [0]'s opening comments to the crowd were, \"the crowd, [0] don't know whether the crowd fully understand that [0] have just been shot, but it takes more than that to kill a Bull Moose.\"[unreliable source?] Only after finishing a 90-minute speech did [0] accept medical attention.Subsequent probes and an x-ray showed that The bullet had lodged in [0]'s chest muscle but did not penetrate the pleura. Doctors concluded that it would be less dangerous to leave The bullet in place than to attempt to remove The bullet, and [0] carried The bullet with [0] for the rest of [0]'s life. Both Taft and Democratic nominee Woodrow Wilson suspended Both Taft and Democratic nominee Woodrow Wilson's own campaigning until [0] recovered and resumed [0]'s. When asked if shot would affect [0]'s election campaign, [0] said to the reporter \"[0]'m fit as a bull moose.\" The bull moose became a symbol of both [0] and the party's, and the party's often was referred to as simply the Bull Moose Party. [0] spent two weeks recuperating before returning to the campaign trail. [0] later wrote a friend about The bullet, \"[0] do not mind The bullet any more than if The bullet were in [0]'s waistcoat pocket.\"After the Democrats nominated Governor Woodrow Wilson of New Jersey, [0] did not expect to win the upcoming presidential election, as Governor Woodrow Wilson of New Jersey had compiled a record attractive to many progressive Democrats who might have otherwise considered voting for [0]. [0] still campaigned vigorously, and the upcoming presidential election developed into a two-person contest despite President Taft's's quiet presence in the upcoming presidential election. [0] respected Governor Woodrow Wilson of New Jersey, but Both Taft and Democratic nominee Woodrow Wilson differed on various issues; Governor Woodrow Wilson of New Jersey opposed any federal intervention regarding women's suffrage or child labor (Governor Woodrow Wilson of New Jersey viewed women's suffrage or child labor as state issues) and attacked [0]'s tolerance of large businesses.[0] won 4.1\u00a0million votes (27%), compared to President Taft's's 3.5\u00a0million (23%) and Governor Woodrow Wilson of New Jersey's gained 6.3\u00a0million (42%). Governor Woodrow Wilson of New Jersey scored a massive landslide in the Electoral College, with 435 electoral votes; [0] won 88 electoral votes, while President Taft's won 8. Pennsylvania was the only eastern state won by [0]; in the Midwest, [0] carried Michigan, Minnesota, and South Dakota; in the West, California, and Washington. Governor Woodrow Wilson of New Jersey's was the first for a Democrat since Cleveland in 1892. Wilson's victory was the party's's best performance in the Electoral College since 1852. [0], meanwhile, garnered a higher share of the popular vote than any other third-party presidential candidate in history and won the most states of any third-party candidate after the Civil War.", "South American expedition (1913\u20131914)": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 1907 a friend of [0]'s, John Augustine Zahm, a professor at the University of Notre Dame, invited [0] to help plan a research expedition to South America. Now was the time to escape politics. To finance a research expedition to South America, [0] obtained support from the American Museum of Natural History in return for promising to bring back many new animal specimens. [0]'s popular book, Through the Brazilian Wilderness describes [0]'s expedition into the Brazilian jungle in 1913 as a member of a research expedition to South Americaits leader, Brazilian explorer C\u00e2ndido Rondon.Once in South America, a new, far more ambitious goal was added: to find the headwaters of the Rio da Duvida (Portuguese for \"River of Doubt\") and trace the Rio da Duvida (Portuguese for \"River of Doubt\") north to the Madeira and thence to the Amazon River. the Rio da Duvida (Portuguese for \"River of Doubt\") was later renamed Roosevelt River in honor of [0]. [0]'s crew consisted of his son Kermit, its leader, Brazilian explorer C\u00e2ndido Rondon, naturalist George Kruck Cherrie (sent by the American Museum of Natural History), Brazilian Lieutenant Jo\u00e3o Lira, team physician Jos\u00e9 Antonio Cajazeira, and 16 skilled paddlers and porters. [0] also identified Leo Miller (another the American Museum of Natural History recommendation), Anthony Fiala, Frank Harper, and Jacob Sigg as crew members. The initial expedition started somewhat tenuously on December 9, 1913, at the height of the rainy season. The trip down the River of Doubt the Rio da Duvida (Portuguese for \"River of Doubt\") started on February 27, 1914.During The trip down the River of Doubtthe Rio da Duvida (Portuguese for \"River of Doubt\"), [0] suffered a minor leg wound after [0] jumped into the Rio da Duvida (Portuguese for \"River of Doubt\") to try to prevent two canoes from smashing against the rocks. a minor leg wound, however, soon gave [0] tropical fever that resembled the malaria he had contracted while in Cuba fifteen years before. Because the bullet lodged in [0]'s chest from the assassination attempt in 1912 was never removed, [0]'s health worsened from tropical fever that resembled the malaria he had contracted while in Cuba fifteen years before. worsened weakened [0] so greatly that six weeks into The initial expedition, [0] had to be attended to day and night by The initial expedition's physician and his son Kermit. By then, [0] could not walk because of the infection in [0]'s injured leg and an infirmity in the other, which was due to a traffic accident a decade earlier. [0] was riddled with chest pains, fighting a fever that soared to 103\u00a0\u00b0F (39\u00a0\u00b0C) and at times made [0] delirious, at one point constantly reciting the first two lines of Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poem \"Kubla Khan\": \"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan / A stately pleasure dome decree\". Regarding [0]'s condition as a threat to the survival of the others, [0] insisted [0] be left behind to allow The initial expedition to proceed as rapidly as The initial expedition could, preparing to commit suicide with an overdose of morphine. Only an appeal by his son Kermit persuaded [0] to continue.Despite [0]'s continued decline and loss of over 50 pounds (23\u00a0kg), its leader, Brazilian explorer C\u00e2ndido Rondon reduced the pace of The initial expedition to allow for its leader, Brazilian explorer C\u00e2ndido Rondon's commission's mapmaking and other geographical tasks, which required regular stops to fix The initial expedition's position by sun-based survey. Upon [0]'s return to New York, friends and family were startled by [0]'s physical appearance and fatigue. [0] wrote, perhaps prophetically, to a friend that The initial expedition had cut [0]'s life short by ten years. For the rest of [0]'s few remaining years, [0] would be plagued by flare-ups of malaria and leg inflammations so severe as to require surgery. Before [0] had even completed [0]'s sea voyage home, critics raised doubts over [0]'s claims of exploring and navigating a completely uncharted river over 625 miles (1,006\u00a0km) long. When [0] had recovered sufficiently, [0] addressed a standing-room-only convention organized in Washington, D.C., by the National Geographic Society and satisfactorily defended [0]'s claims.[page\u00a0needed]", "Final years": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] returned to the United States in May 1914. Though [0] was outraged by the Wilson Administration's conclusion of a treaty that expressed \"sincere regret\" for the way in which the United States had acquired the Panama Canal Zone, [0] was impressed by many of the reforms passed under Wilson. [0] made several campaign appearances for the Progressives, but the 1914 elections were a disaster for the Progressives. [0] began to envision another campaign for president, this time with [0] at the head of the Republican Party, but conservative party leaders remained opposed to [0]. In hopes of engineering a joint nomination, the Progressives scheduled the 1916 Progressive National Convention at the same time as the 1916 Republican National Convention. When the Republican Party nominated Charles Evans Hughes, [0] declined the Progressive nomination and urged his Progressive followers to support Charles Evans Hughes. Though [0] had long disliked Charles Evans Hughes, [0] disliked Wilson even more, and [0] campaigned energetically for Charles Evans Hughes. However, Wilson won the 1914 elections by a narrow margin. the Progressives disappeared as a party following the 1914 elections, and [0] and many of his Progressive followers permanently re-joined the Republican Party.When the First World War began in 1914, [0] strongly supported the Allies and demanded a harsher policy against Germany, especially regarding submarine warfare. [0] angrily denounced the foreign policy of President Wilson, calling the foreign policy of President Wilson a failure regarding the atrocities in Belgium and the violations of American rights. In 1916, while campaigning for Charles Evans Hughes, [0] repeatedly denounced Irish Americans and German Americans whom he described as unpatriotic, saying Irish Americans and German Americans whom he described as unpatriotic put the interests of Ireland and Germany ahead of the United States's by supporting neutrality. [0] insisted that one had to be 100% American, not a \"hyphenated American\" who juggled multiple loyalties. In March 1917, Congress gave [0] the authority to raise a maximum of four divisions similar to the Rough Riders, and Major Frederick Russell Burnham was put in charge of both the general organization and recruitment. However, Wilson announced to the press that Wilson would not send [0] and [0]'s volunteers to France, but instead would send an American Expeditionary Force under the command of General John J. Pershing. [0] never forgave Wilson, and quickly published The Foes of Our Own Household, an indictment of Wilson. Roosevelt's youngest son, Quentin, a pilot with the American forces in France, was killed when shot down behind German lines on July 14, 1918, at the age of 20. It is said that Roosevelt's youngest son, Quentin, a pilot with the American forces in France,'s distressed [0] so much that [0] never recovered from Roosevelt's youngest son, Quentin, a pilot with the American forces in France,'s loss.[0] was an early supporter of the modern view that there needs to be a global order. In [0]'s Nobel prize address of 1910, [0] said, \"it would be a master stroke if those great Powers honestly bent on peace would form a League of Peace, not only to keep the peace among those great Powers honestly bent on peace, but to prevent, by force if necessary, a League of Peace's being broken by others.\" a League of Peace would have executive power such as the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 lacked. [0] called for American participation.When the First World War broke out, [0] proposed \"a World League for the Peace of Righteousness\", in September 1914, which would preserve sovereignty but limit armaments and require arbitration. [0] added that it should be \"solemnly covenanted that if any nations refused to abide by the decisions of such a court, then others draw the sword in behalf of peace and justice.\" In 1915 [0] outlined \"a World League for the Peace of Righteousness\" more specifically, urging that nations guarantee nations's entire military force, if necessary, against any nation that refused to carry out arbitration decrees or violated rights of other nations. Though [0] had some concerns about the impact on United States sovereignty, [0] insisted that such a league would only work if United States participated as one of the \"joint guarantors\". [0] referred to \"a World League for the Peace of Righteousness\" in a 1918 speech as \"the most feasible for...a league of nations\". By this time Wilson was strongly hostile to [0] and Lodge and developed Wilson's own plans for a rather different League of Nations. a rather different League of Nations became reality along Wilson's lines at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. [0] denounced Wilson's approach but died before Wilson's approach was adopted at Paris. However, Lodge was willing to accept Wilson's approach with serious reservations. In the end, on March 19, 1920, Wilson had Democratic Senators vote against a rather different League of Nations with the Lodge Reservations and the United States never joined a rather different League of Nations.[0]'s attacks on Wilson helped the Republican Party win control of Congress in the midterm elections of 1918. [0] declined a request from New York Republicans to run for another gubernatorial term, but attacked Wilson's Fourteen Points, calling instead for the unconditional surrender of Germany. Though [0]'s health was uncertain, [0] was seen as a leading contender for the 1920 Republican nomination, but insisted that, \"If they take [0], they'll have to take [0] without a single modification of the things that [0] have always stood for!\"  [0] wrote William Allen White, \"[0] wish to do everything in [0]'s power to make the Republican Party the Party of sane, constructive radicalism, just as the Republican Party was under Lincoln.\" Accordingly, [0] told the 1918 state convention of the Republican Party that [0] stood for old-age pensions, insurance for sickness and unemployment, construction of public housing for low-income families, the reduction of working hours, aid to farmers, and more regulation of large corporations.While [0]'s political profile remained high, [0]'s physical condition continued to deteriorate throughout 1918 due to the long-term effects of jungle diseases. [0] was hospitalized for seven weeks late in 1918 and never fully recovered.", "": ""}, "Death": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. On the night of January 5, 1919, [0] suffered breathing problems. After receiving treatment from [0]'s physician, George W. Faller, [0] felt better and went to bed. [0]'s last words were \"Please put out that light, James\" to [0]'s family servant James E. Amos. Between 4:00 and 4:15 the next morning, [0] died at the age of 60 in [0]'s sleep at Sagamore Hill after a blood clot detached from a vein and traveled to [0]'s lungs.Upon receiving word of [0]'s , his son Archibald telegraphed his son Archibald's siblings: \"[0] is dead.\" Woodrow Wilson's vice president, Thomas R. Marshall, said that \"Death had to take [0] sleeping, for if [0] had been awake, there would have been a fight.\" Following a private farewell service in the North Room at Sagamore Hill, a simple funeral was held at Christ Episcopal Church in Oyster Bay. Woodrow Wilson's vice president, Thomas R. Marshall,, Charles Evans Hughes, Warren G. Harding, Henry Cabot Lodge, and William Howard Taft were among the mourners. The snow-covered procession route to Youngs Memorial Cemetery was lined with spectators and a squad of mounted policemen who had ridden from New York City. [0] was buried on a hillside overlooking Oyster Bay."}, "Writer": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was a prolific author, writing with passion on subjects ranging from foreign policy to the importance of the national park system. [0] was also an avid reader of poetry. Poet Robert Frost said that [0] \"was our kind. [0] quoted poetry to Poet Robert Frost. [0] knew poetry.\"As an editor of The Outlook, [0] had weekly access to a large, educated national audience. In all, [0] wrote about 18 books (each in several editions), including [0]'s autobiography, The Rough Riders, History of the Naval War of 1812, and others on subjects such as ranching, explorations, and wildlife. [0]'s most ambitious book was the four-volume narrative The Winning of the West, focused on the American frontier in the 18th and early 19th centuries. [0] said that the American character\u2014indeed a new \"American race\" (ethnic group) had emerged from the heroic wilderness hunters and Indian fighters, acting on the American frontier with little government help. [0] also published an account of [0]'s 1909\u20131910 African expedition entitled African Game Trails.In 1905, [0] became embroiled in a widely publicized literary debate known as the nature fakers controversy. A few years earlier, naturalist John Burroughs had published an article entitled \"Real and Sham Natural History\" in the Atlantic Monthly, attacking popular writers of the day such as Ernest Thompson Seton, Charles G. D. Roberts, and William J. Long for popular writers of the day such as Ernest Thompson Seton, Charles G. D. Roberts, and William J. Long's fantastical representations of wildlife. [0] agreed with naturalist John Burroughs's criticisms and published several essays of [0]'s own denouncing the booming genre of \"naturalistic\" animal stories as \"yellow journalism of the woods\". It was [0] who popularized the negative term \"nature faker\" to describe writers who depicted their animal characters with excessive anthropomorphismwriters who depicted their animal characters with excessive anthropomorphism's ."}, "Character and beliefs": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] intensely disliked being called \"Teddy\", despite the widespread public association with \"Teddy\", and was quick to point out disliked to those who referred to [0] as such, though \"Teddy\" would become widely used by newspapers during [0]'s political career.[0] was an active Freemason and member of the Sons of the American Revolution. [0] was also a member of The Explorers Club.British scholar Marcus Cunliffe evaluates the liberal argument that [0] was an opportunist, exhibitionist, and imperialist. British scholar Marcus Cunliffe praises [0]'s versatility, [0]'s respect for law, and [0]'s sincerity. British scholar Marcus Cunliffe argues that [0]'s foreign policy was better than [0]'s detractors allege. British scholar Marcus Cunliffe calls [0] \"a big man in several respects,\" ranking [0] below Washington, Lincoln, and Jefferson, and on the same level as Franklin D. Roosevelt.", "Strenuous life": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] had a lifelong interest in pursuing what [0] called, in an 1899 speech, \"The Strenuous Life\". To pursuing, [0] exercised regularly and took up boxing, tennis, hiking, rowing, polo, and horseback riding. [0] also continued [0]'s habit of skinny-dipping in the Potomac River during the winter. As governor of New York, [0] boxed with sparring partners several times each week, a practice [0] regularly continued as president until being hit so hard in the face [0] became blind in [0]'s left eye (a fact not made public until many years later). As president, [0] practiced judo for two 2-month periods in 1902 and 1904, not attaining any rank. [0] began to believe in the utility of jiu-jitsu training after training with Yoshitsugu Yamashita. Concerned that the United States would lose the United States's military supremacy to rising powers like Japan, [0] began to advocate for jiu-jitsu training for American soldiers. Feminists annoyed by the posturing of men like Roosevelt, insisted that women were just as capable of learning jiu-jitsu. To prove Feminists annoyed by the posturing of men like Roosevelt's point, Martha Blow Wadsworth and Maria Louise (\"Hallie\") Davis Elkins hired Fude Yamashita, a highly skilled jiu-jitsu instructor and the wife of Yoshitsugu Yamashita, to teach a jiu-jitsu class for women and girls in Washington, D.C., in 1904. Women had already begun training in boxing in the United States as a means of personal and political empowerment. Jiu-jitsu training thus soon also became popular with American women, coinciding with the origins of a women's self-defense movement.[0] was an enthusiastic singlestick player and, according to Harper's Weekly, showed up at a White House reception with [0]'s arm bandaged after a bout with General Leonard Wood in 1905. [0] was an avid reader, reading tens of thousands of books, at a rate of several per day in multiple languages. Along with Thomas Jefferson, [0] was the most well-read of all American presidents.", "Warrior": "[0] is our person to focus on. Historians have often emphasized [0]'s warrior persona. [0] took aggressive positions regarding war with Spain in 1898, Colombia in 1903, and especially with Germany, from 1915 to 1917. As a demonstration of American naval might, [0] sent the \"Great White Fleet\" around the world in 1907\u20131909. The implicit threat of the \"big stick\" of military power provided leverage to \"speak softly\" and quietly resolve conflict in numerous cases. [0] boasted in [0]'s autobiography:When [0] left the Presidency [0] finished seven and a half years of administration, during which not one shot had been fired against a foreign foe. We were at absolute peace, and there was no nation in the world with whom a war cloud threatened, no nation in the world whom We had wronged, or from whom We had anything to fear. The cruise of the \"Great White Fleet\" was not the least of the causes which ensured so peaceful an outlook. Richard D. White Jr states, \"[0]'s warrior spirit framed [0]'s views of national politics, [and] international relations.\"Historian Howard K. Beale has argued:[0] and [0]'s associates came close to seeking war for war's own sake. Ignorant of modern war, [0] romanticized war. ... Like many young men tamed by civilization into law-abiding but adventurous living, [0] needed an outlet for the pent-up primordial man in him and found an outlet for the pent-up primordial man in him in fighting and killing, vicariously or directly, in hunting or in war. Indeed [0] had a fairly good time in war when war came. ... There was something dull and effeminate about peace. ... [0] gloried in war, was thrilled by military history, and placed warlike qualities high in [0]'s scale of values. Without consciously desiring it, [0] thought a little war now and then stimulated admirable qualities in men. Certainly preparedness for war did. ", "Religion": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] attended church regularly and was a lifelong adherent of the Reformed Church in America, the American affiliate of the Dutch Reformed Church. [0] often praised moral behavior but apparently never made a spiritual confession of [0]'s own faith. After the 1885 death of [0]'s wife, [0] almost never mentioned Jesus Christ in public or private. Benjamin J. Wetzel says, \"There is little in [0] suggestive of grace, mercy, or redemption.\" [0]'s rejection of dogma and spirituality, says biographer William Harbaugh, led to a broad tolerance. [0] campaigned among Protestants, Catholics and Jews, and appointed Protestants, Catholics and Jews to office. [0] was suspicious of Mormons until Mormons renounced polygamy.In 1907, concerning the proposed motto \"In God We Trust\" on money, [0] wrote, \"It seems to [0] eminently unwise to cheapen such a motto by use on coins, just as it would be to cheapen such a motto by use on postage stamps, or in advertisements.\" [0] talked a great deal about religion. Biographer Edmund Morris states:When consoling bereaved people, [0] would awkwardly invoke 'unseen and unknown powers.' Aside from a few clich\u00e9s of Protestant rhetoric, the gospel [0] preached had always been political and pragmatic. [0] was inspired less by the Passion of Jesus Christ than by the Golden Rule\u2014that appeal to reason amounting, in [0]'s mind, to a worldly rather than heavenly law. [0] publicly encouraged church attendance and was a conscientious churchgoer [0]. When gas rationing was introduced during the First World War, [0] walked the three miles from [0]'s home at Sagamore Hill to the local church and back, even after a serious operation had made it difficult for [0] to travel by foot. It was said that [0] \"allowed no engagement to keep [0] from going to church,\" and [0] remained a fervent advocate of the Bible throughout [0]'s adult life. According to Christian F. Reisner, \"Religion was as natural to [0] as breathing,\" and when the travel library for [0]'s famous Smithsonian-sponsored African expedition was being assembled, the Bible was, according to [0]'s sister, \"the first book selected\". In an address delivered to the Long Island Bible Society in 1901, [0] declared that:Every thinking man, when Every thinking man thinks, realizes what a very large number of people tend to forget, that the teachings of the Bible are so interwoven and entwined with our whole civic and social life that it would be literally\u2014[0] do not mean figuratively, [0] mean literally\u2014impossible for us to figure to us what our whole civic and social life would be if the teachings of the Bible were removed. We would lose almost all the standards by which we now judge both public and private morals; all the standards toward which we, with more or less of resolution, strive to raise ourselves. Almost every man who has by his lifework added to the sum of human achievement of which the race is proudAlmost every man who has by his lifework added to the sum of human achievement of which the race is proud's , has based Almost every man who has by his lifework added to the sum of human achievement of which the race is proud's largely upon the teachings of the Bible ... Among the greatest men a disproportionately large number have been diligent and close students of the Bible at first hand. "}, "Political positions": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. When [0] assumed the presidency, [0] reassured many conservatives, stating that \"the mechanism of modern business is so delicate that extreme care must be taken not to interfere with the mechanism of modern business in a spirit of rashness or ignorance.\" The following year, [0] asserted [0]'s independence from business interests by opposing the merger which created the Northern Securities Company, and many were surprised that any president, much less an unelected one, would challenge powerful banker J.P. Morgan. In [0]'s last two years as the presidency, [0] became increasingly distrustful of big business, despite big business's close ties to the Republican Party. [0] sought to replace the 19th-century laissez-faire economic environment with a new economic model which included a larger regulatory role for the federal government. [0] believed that 19th-century entrepreneurs had risked 19th-century entrepreneurs's fortunes on innovations and new businesses, and that 19th-century entrepreneurs had been rightly rewarded. By contrast, [0] believed that 20th-century capitalists risked little but nonetheless reaped huge and, given the lack of risk, unjust, economic rewards. Without a redistribution of wealth away from the upper class, [0] feared that the federal government would turn to radicals or fall to revolution. His Square Deal domestic program had three main goals: conservation of natural resources, control of corporations, and consumer protection. His Square Deal domestic program evolved into [0]'s program of \"New Nationalism\", which emphasized the priority of labor over capital interests and a need to more effectively control corporate creation and combination, and proposed a ban on corporate political contributions.", "Foreign policy beliefs": "[0] is our person to focus on. In the analysis by Henry Kissinger, [0] was the first president to develop the guideline that it was the duty of the United States to make the United States's enormous power and potential influence felt globally. The idea of being a passive \"city on the hill\" model that others could look up to, [0] rejected. [0], was a social Darwinist who believed in survival of the fittest. The international world in [0]'s view was a realm of violence and conflict. the United States had all the economic and geographical potential to be the fittest nation on The international world. the United States had a duty to act decisively. For example, in terms of the Monroe Doctrine, the United States had to prevent European incursions in the Western Hemisphere. But there was more, as [0] expressed in [0]'s famous [0] Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine: the United States had to be the policeman of the Western Hemisphere because unruly, corrupt smaller nations had to be controlled, and if the United States did not do controlled, European powers would in fact intervene and develop European powers's own base of power in the Western Hemisphere in contravention to the Monroe Doctrine.[0] was a realist and a conservative. [0] deplored many of the increasingly popular idealistic liberal themes, such as were promoted by William Jennings Bryan, the anti-imperialists, and Woodrow Wilson. Henry Kissinger says [0] rejected the efficacy of international law. [0] argued that if a country could not protect a country's own interests, the international community could not help very much. [0] ridiculed disarmament proposals that were increasingly common. [0] saw no likelihood of an international power capable of checking wrongdoing on a major scale. As for world government:  [0] regard the Wilson\u2013Bryan attitude of trusting to fantastic peace treaties, too impossible promises, to all kinds of scraps of paper without any backing in efficient force, as abhorrent. It is infinitely better for a nation and for The international world to have the Frederick the Great and Bismarck tradition as regards foreign policy than to have the Bryan or Bryan\u2013Wilson attitude as a permanent national attitude.... A milk-and-water righteousness unbacked by force is...as wicked as and even more mischievous than force divorced from righteousness. On [0]'s international outlook, [0] favored spheres of influence, whereby one great power would generally prevail, such as the United States in the Western Hemisphere or Great Britain in the Indian subcontinent. Japan fit that role and [0] approved. However, [0] had deep distrust of both Germany and Russia."}, "Legacy": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. Historians credit [0] for changing the nation's's political system by permanently placing the \"bully pulpit\" of the presidency at center stage and making character as important as the issues. [0]'s accomplishments include trust busting and conservationism. [0] is a hero to liberals and progressives for [0]'s proposals in 1907\u20131912 that presaged the modern welfare state of the New Deal Era, including direct federal taxation, labor reforms, and more direct democracy, while conservationists admire [0] for putting the environment and selflessness towards future generations on the national agenda, and conservatives and nationalists respect [0]'s commitment to law and order, civic duty, and military values, as well as [0]'s personality of individual self-responsibility and hardiness. Dalton says, \"Today [0] is heralded as the architect of the modern presidency, as a world leader who boldly reshaped the presidency to meet the needs of the new century and redefined the nation's's place in the world.\"Liberals and socialists have also criticized [0] for [0]'s interventionist and imperialist approach to nations [0] considered \"uncivilized\". Conservatives and libertarians reject [0]'s vision of the welfare state and emphasis on the superiority of government over private action. Historians typically rank [0] among the top five presidents in American history.In his's memoirs, his paid tribute to [0]'s contributions to liberalism in the nation's while lambasting his successor William Howard Taft, writing that \"[0] had been far to the left for a Republican-but sill right of center as far as the Democrats were concerned-and had put into effect a lot of liberal ideas such as conservation of natural resources and the checking of 'malefactors of great wealth.' his successor William Howard Taft was an ultra-conservative and partial to the special interests. his successor William Howard Taft was not willing to use the full power of the presidency.\"", "Persona and masculinity": "[0] is our person to focus on. Dalton says [0] is remembered as \"one of the most picturesque personalities who has ever enlivened the landscape\". [0]'s friend, historian Henry Adams, proclaimed: \"[0], more than any other man... showed the singular primitive quality that belongs to ultimate matter\u2014the quality that medieval theology assigned to God\u2014[0] was pure act.[0]'s biographers have stressed [0]'s personality. Henry F. Pringle, who won the Pulitzer Prize in biography for his Theodore Roosevelt (1931) Henry F. Pringle, who won the Pulitzer Prize in biography for his Theodore Roosevelt (1931)'s stated: \"The Theodore Roosevelt of later years was the most adolescent of men... Failure to receive the Medal of Honor for [0]'s exploits [in Cuba] had been a grief as real as any of those which swamp childhood in despair. 'You must always remember,' wrote Cecil Spring Rice in 1904, 'that [0] is about six.'\"Cooper compared [0] with Woodrow Wilson and argued that both of them played the roles of warrior and priest. Dalton stressed [0]'s strenuous life. Sarah Watts examined the desires of the \"Rough Rider in the White House\". Brands calls [0] \"the last romantic\", arguing that [0]'s romantic concept of life emerged from [0]'s belief that \"physical bravery was the highest virtue and war the ultimate test of bravery\".[0] as the exemplar of American masculinity has become a major theme. As president, [0] repeatedly warned men that men were becoming too office-bound, too complacent, too comfortable with physical ease and moral laxity, and were failing in men's duties to propagate the race and exhibit masculine vigor. French historian Serge Ricard says, \"[0] offers ideal material for a detailed psycho-historical analysis of aggressive manhood in the changing socio-cultural environment of [0]'s era; McKinley, Taft, or Woodrow Wilson would perhaps inadequately serve that purpose\". [0] promoted competitive sports like boxing and jiu-jitsu for physically strengthening American men. [0] also believed that organizations like the Boy Scouts of America, founded in 1910, could help mold and strengthen the character of American boys. Brands shows that heroic displays of bravery were essential to [0]'s image and mission: What makes the hero a hero is the romantic notion that the hero stands above the tawdry give and take of everyday politics, occupying an ethereal realm where partisanship gives way to patriotism, and division to unity, and where the race regains the race's lost innocence, and the people the people's shared sense of purpose. In 1902, French artist Th\u00e9obald Chartran was commissioned to paint [0]'s likeness for his presidential portrait. [0] reportedly hid his presidential portrait in a closet before having his presidential portrait destroyed because his presidential portrait made [0] look weak, like a \"meek kitten\". In a letter to [0]'s son Kermit Roosevelt, [0] plainly stated, \"French artist Th\u00e9obald Chartran has been painting his presidential portrait. [0] do not particularly like his presidential portrait.\" John Singer Sargent was instead chosen by [0] to paint his presidential portrait.", "Relations with Andrew Carnegie": "Theodore Roosevelt is our person to focus on. According to David Nasaw, after 1898, when the United States entered a war with Spain, [0] increasingly devoted [0]'s energy to supporting pacifism. [0] sold [0]'s steel company and now had the time and the dollars to make an impact. [0] strongly opposed a war with Spain and the subsequent imperialistic American takeover of the Philippines. When Theodore Roosevelt became president in 1901, Carnegie and Roosevelt were in frequent contact. Carnegie and Roosevelt exchanged letters, communicated through mutual friends such as Secretary of State John Hay, and met in person. [0] offered a steady stream of advice on foreign policy, especially on arbitration. [0] hoped that Theodore Roosevelt would turn the Philippines free, not realizing Theodore Roosevelt was more of an imperialist and believer in warrior virtues than President McKinley had been. [0] saluted Theodore Roosevelt for forcing Germany and Britain to arbitrate Germany and Britain's conflict with Venezuela in 1903, and especially for becoming the mediator who negotiated an end to the war between Russia and Japan in 1907\u20131908. Theodore Roosevelt relied on [0] for financing Theodore Roosevelt's expedition to Africa in 1909. In return Theodore Roosevelt asked Theodore Roosevelt to mediate the growing conflict between the two cousins who ruled Britain and Germany. Theodore Roosevelt started to do so but the scheme collapsed when king Edward VII suddenly died. David Nasaw argues that Theodore Roosevelt systematically deceived and manipulated [0] and held [0] in contempt. David Nasaw quotes a private letter Theodore Roosevelt wrote to Whitelaw Reid in 1905:  [Theodore Roosevelt have] tried hard to like [0], but like is pretty difficult. There is no type of man for whom Theodore Roosevelt feel a more contemptuous abhorrence than for the one who makes a God of mere money-making and at the same time is always yelling out that kind of utterly stupid condemnation of war which in almost every case springs from a combination of defective physical courage, of unmanly shrinking from pain and effort, and of hopelessly twisted ideals. All the suffering from Spanish war comes far short of the suffering, preventable and non-preventable, among the operators of the Carnegie steel works, and among the small investors, during the time that [0] was making [0]'s fortune....It is as noxious folly to denounce war per se as it is to denounce business per se. Unrighteous war is a hideous evil; but David Nasaw am not at all sure that Unrighteous war is worse evil than business unrighteousness.

[0] was included with Presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Abraham Lincoln at the Mount Rushmore Memorial, designed in 1927 with the approval of Republican President Calvin Coolidge.For his gallantry at San Juan Hill, [0]'s commanders recommended [0] for the Medal of Honor. However, recommended lacked any eyewitnesses, and recommended was eventually tainted by [0]'s own lobbying of the War Department.
