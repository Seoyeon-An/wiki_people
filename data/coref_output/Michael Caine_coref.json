Culminating in a cliffhanger, the 1969 comedy caper film The Italian Job has one of the most discussed end scenes in film; what happened to the coachload of gold teetering over the edge of a cliff has been debated in the decades since the 1969 comedy caper film The Italian Job was released.After working on the 1969 comedy caper film The Italian Job with No\u00ebl Coward, and a role as RAF fighter pilot squadron leader Canfield in the all-star cast of Battle of Britain (both 1969), [0] played the lead in Get Carter (1971), a British gangster film.
