His father, Zachariah Zelilo Tutu, was from the amaFengu branch of Xhosa and grew up in Gcuwa, Eastern Cape. At home, the couple spoke Xhosa. Having married in Boksburg, the couple moved to Klerksdorp, Transvaal, South Africa in the late 1950s, living in Klerksdorp, Transvaal, South Africa's \"native location\", or black residential area, since renamed Makoetend. His father, Zachariah Zelilo Tutu, worked as the principal of a Methodist primary school and the family lived in the mud-brick schoolmaster's house in the yard of the Methodist mission.the family were poor; describing the family, [0] later related that \"although the family weren't affluent, the family were not destitute either\".

To avoid the expense of a daily train commute to school, [0] briefly lived with family nearer to Johannesburg, before moving back in with the couple when the couple relocated to Munsieville. [0] then returned to Johannesburg, moving into an Anglican hostel near the Church of Christ the King in Sophiatown. [0] became a server at the Church of Christ the King in Sophiatown and came under the influence of the Church of Christ the King in Sophiatown's ; later biographer Shirley du Boulay suggested that its priest, Trevor Huddleston was \"the greatest single influence\" in [0]'s life. In 1947, [0] contracted tuberculosis and was hospitalised in Rietfontein for 18 months, during which [0] was regularly visited by its priest, Trevor Huddleston. In the hospital, [0] underwent circumcision to mark [0]'s transition to manhood.

Although [0] secured admission to study medicine at the University of the Witwatersrand, [0]'s parents could not afford the tuition fees. Instead, [0] turned toward teaching, gaining a government scholarship for a course at Pretoria Bantu Normal College, a teacher training institution, in 1951. There, [0] served as treasurer of the Student Representative Council, helped to organise the Literacy and Dramatic Society, and chaired the Cultural and Debating Society.

In 1953, [0] introduced the Bantu Education Act to further [0]'s apartheid system of racial segregation and white domination. Disliking the Bantu Education Act, Tutu and his wife left the teaching profession. With Huddleston's support, Desmond Tutu chose to become an Anglican priest. In January 1956, Desmond Tutu's request to join the Ordinands Guild was turned down due to his debts; his debts were then paid off by the wealthy industrialist Harry Oppenheimer. Desmond Tutu was admitted to St Peter's Theological College in Rosettenville, Johannesburg, which was run by the Anglican Community of the Resurrection. St Peter's Theological College in Rosettenville, Johannesburg, which was run by the Anglican Community of the Resurrection was residential, and Desmond Tutu lived there while his wife trained as a nurse in Sekhukhuneland; Tutu and his wife's children lived with Desmond Tutu's parents in Munsieville. In August 1960, his wife gave birth to another daughter, Naomi.At St Peter's Theological College in Rosettenville, Johannesburg, which was run by the Anglican Community of the Resurrection, Desmond Tutu studied the Bible, Anglican doctrine, church history, and Christian ethics, earning a Licentiate of Theology degree, and winning the archbishop's annual essay prize. St Peter's Theological College in Rosettenville, Johannesburg, which was run by the Anglican Community of the Resurrection's principal, Godfrey Pawson, wrote that Desmond Tutu \"has exceptional knowledge and intelligence and is very industrious. At the same time, Desmond Tutu shows no arrogance, mixes in well, and is popular ... Desmond Tutu has obvious gifts of leadership.\" During Desmond Tutu's years at St Peter's Theological College in Rosettenville, Johannesburg, which was run by the Anglican Community of the Resurrection, there had been an intensification in anti-apartheid activism as well as a crackdown against anti-apartheid activism, including the Sharpeville massacre of 1960. Tutu and the other trainees did not engage in anti-apartheid campaigns; Desmond Tutu later noted that Tutu and the other trainees were \"in some ways a very apolitical bunch\".In December 1960, Edward Paget ordained Desmond Tutu as an Anglican priest at St Mary's Cathedral. Desmond Tutu was then appointed assistant curate in St Alban's Parish, Benoni, where Desmond Tutu was reunited with his wife and children, and earned two-thirds of what Desmond Tutu's white counterparts were given. In 1962, Desmond Tutu was transferred to St Philip's Church in Thokoza, where Desmond Tutu was placed in charge of the congregation and developed a passion for pastoral ministry. Many in South Africa's's white-dominated Anglican establishment felt the need for more black Africans in positions of ecclesiastical authority; to assist in the need for more black Africans in positions of ecclesiastical authority, Aelfred Stubbs proposed that Desmond Tutu train as a theology teacher at King's College London (KCL). Funding was secured from the International Missionary Council's Theological Education Fund (TEF), and the government agreed to give the Tutus permission to move to Britain. the Tutus duly did so in September 1962.At King's College London (KCL), Desmond Tutu studied under theologians like Dennis Nineham, Christopher Evans, Sydney Evans, Geoffrey Parrinder, and Eric Mascall. In London, the Tutus felt liberated experiencing a life free from South Africa's's apartheid and pass laws; Desmond Tutu later noted that \"there is racism in the government, but the Tutus were not exposed to racism\". Desmond Tutu was also impressed by the freedom of speech in London, especially at Speakers' Corner in London's Hyde Park. the Tutus moved into the curate's flat behind the Church of St Alban the Martyr in Golders Green, where Tutu assisted Sunday services, the first time that Desmond Tutu had ministered to a white congregation. It was in the curate's flat behind the Church of St Alban the Martyr in Golders Green, where Tutu assisted Sunday services that a daughter, Mpho Andrea Tutu, was born in 1963. Desmond Tutu was academically successful and Desmond Tutu's tutors suggested that Desmond Tutu convert to an honours degree, which entailed Desmond Tutu's also studying Hebrew. Desmond Tutu received an honours degree from Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother in a ceremony held at the Royal Albert Hall.Desmond Tutu then secured a the International Missionary Council's Theological Education Fund (TEF) grant to study for a master's degree, doing so from October 1965 until September 1966, completing Desmond Tutu's dissertation on Islam in West Africa. During this period, the Tutus moved to Bletchingley in Surrey, where Tutu worked as the assistant curate of St Mary's Church. In Bletchingley in Surrey, where Tutu worked as the assistant curate of St Mary's Church, Desmond Tutu encouraged cooperation between Desmond Tutu's Anglican parishioners and the local Roman Catholic and Methodist communities. Desmond Tutu's time in London helped Desmond Tutu to jettison any bitterness to whites and feelings of racial inferiority; Desmond Tutu overcame Desmond Tutu's habit of automatically deferring to whites.", "": ""}, "Career during apartheid": {"Teaching in South Africa and Lesotho: 1966\u20131972": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 1966, Tutu and his family moved to East Jerusalem, where [0] studied Arabic and Greek for two months at St George's College. Tutu and his family then returned to South Africa, settling in Alice, Eastern Cape, in 1967. The Federal Theological Seminary (Fedsem) had recently been established there as an amalgamation of training institutions from different Christian denominations. At The Federal Theological Seminary (Fedsem), [0] was employed teaching doctrine, the Old Testament, and Greek; Leah became The Federal Theological Seminary (Fedsem)'s library assistant. [0] was The Federal Theological Seminary (Fedsem)'s first black staff-member, and the campus allowed a level of racial-mixing which was rare in South Africa. The Tutus sent their children to a private boarding school in Swaziland, thereby keeping their children from South Africa's Bantu Education syllabus.[0] joined a pan-Protestant group, the Church Unity Commission, served as a delegate at Anglican-Catholic conversations, and began publishing in academic journals. [0] also became the Anglican chaplain to the neighbouring University of Fort Hare; in an unusual move for the time, [0] invited female as well as male students to become servers during the Eucharist. [0] joined student delegations to meetings of the Anglican Students' Federation and the University Christian Movement, and was broadly supportive of the Black Consciousness Movement that emerged from South Africa's 1960s student milieu, although did not share the Black Consciousness Movement that emerged from South Africa's 1960s student milieu's view on avoiding collaboration with whites. In August 1968, [0] gave a sermon comparing South Africa's situation with that in the Eastern Bloc, likening anti-apartheid protests to the recent Prague Spring. In September, the neighbouring University of Fort Hare held a sit-in protest over the university administration's policies; after Fort Hare students were surrounded by police with dogs, [0] waded into Fort Hare students to pray with Fort Hare students. This was the first time that [0] had witnessed state power used to suppress dissent.In January 1970, [0] left The Federal Theological Seminary (Fedsem) for a teaching post at the University of Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland (UBLS) in Roma, Lesotho. a teaching post at the University of Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland (UBLS) in Roma, Lesotho brought [0] closer to their children and offered twice the salary [0] earned at The Federal Theological Seminary (Fedsem). [0] and [0]'s wife moved to the campus; most of [0]'s fellow staff members were white expatriates from the US or Britain. As well as [0]'s teaching position, [0] also became The Federal Theological Seminary (Fedsem)'s Anglican chaplain and the warden of two student residences. In Lesotho, [0] joined the executive board of the Lesotho Ecumenical Association and served as an external examiner for both The Federal Theological Seminary (Fedsem) and Rhodes University. [0] returned to South Africa on several occasions, including to visit his father shortly before his father's death in February 1971.", "TEF Africa director: 1972\u20131975": "Desmond Tutu is our person to focus on. Black theology seeks to make sense of [0], and to understand [0] in the light of what God has said about God, about man, and about the world in God's very definite Word... Black theology has to do with whether it is possible to be black and continue to be Christian; Black theology is to ask on whose side is God; Black theology is to be concerned about the humanisation of man, because those who ravage our humanity dehumanise those who ravage our humanity in the process; [Black theology says] that the liberation of the black man is the other side of the liberation of the white man\u2014so Black theology is concerned with human liberation.\u2014 Desmond Tutu, in a conference paper presented at the Union Theological Seminary, Desmond Tutu accepted TEF's's offer of a job as their director for Africa, a position based in England. South Africa's's government initially refused permission, regarding Desmond Tutu with suspicion since the Fort Hare protests, but relented after Desmond Tutu argued that Desmond Tutu's taking a job as their director for Africa, a position based in England would be good publicity for South Africa's. In March 1972, Desmond Tutu returned to Britain. TEF's's headquarters were in Bromley, with the Tutu family settling in nearby Grove Park, where Desmond Tutu became honorary curate of St Augustine's Church.Desmond Tutu's job entailed assessing grants to theological training institutions and students. assessing required Desmond Tutu's touring Africa in the early 1970s, and Desmond Tutu wrote accounts of Desmond Tutu's experiences. In Zaire, Desmond Tutu for instance lamented the widespread corruption and poverty and complained that Mobutu Sese Seko's \"military regime... is extremely galling to a black from South Africa's.\" In Nigeria, Desmond Tutu expressed concern at Igbo resentment following the crushing of Igbo's Republic of Biafra. In 1972 Desmond Tutu travelled around East Africa, where Desmond Tutu was impressed by Jomo Kenyatta's Kenyan government and witnessed Idi Amin's expulsion of Ugandan Asians.During the early 1970s, Desmond Tutu's theology changed due to Desmond Tutu's experiences in Africa and Desmond Tutu's discovery of liberation theology. Desmond Tutu was also attracted to black theology, attending a 1973 conference on black theology at the Union Theological Seminary. There, Desmond Tutu presented a paper in which he stated that \"black theology is an engaged not an academic, detached theology. black theology is a gut level theology, relating to the real concerns, the life and death issues of the black man.\" Desmond Tutu stated that a paper in which he stated that \"black theology is an engaged not an academic, detached theology was not an attempt to demonstrate the academic respectability of black theology but rather to make \"a straightforward, perhaps shrill, statement about an existent. Black theology is. No permission is being requested for black theology to come into being... Frankly the time has passed when we will wait for the white man to give we permission to do we's thing. Whether or not the white man accepts the intellectual respectability of we's activity is largely irrelevant. we will proceed regardless.\" Seeking to fuse the African-American derived black theology with African theology, Desmond Tutu's approach contrasted with that of those African theologians, like John Mbiti, who regarded black theology as a foreign import irrelevant to Africa.", "Dean of St Mary's Cathedral, Johannesburg and Bishop of Lesotho: 1975\u20131978": "[0] is our person to focus on.

Although majority white, St Mary's Cathedral, Johannesburg's was racially mixed, something that gave [0] hope that a racially equal, de-segregated future was possible for South Africa's. [0] encountered some resistance to [0]'s attempts to modernise the liturgies used by the cathedral's congregation, including [0]'s attempts to replace masculine pronouns with gender neutral ones.[0] used [0]'s position to speak out on social issues, publicly endorsing an international economic boycott of South Africa's over apartheid. [0] met with Black Consciousness and Soweto leaders, and shared a platform with anti-apartheid campaigner Winnie Mandela in opposing the government's Terrorism Act, 1967. [0] held a 24-hour vigil for racial harmony at the cathedral where [0] prayed for activists detained under the government's Terrorism Act, 1967. In May 1976, [0] wrote to Prime Minister B. J. Vorster, warning that if South Africa's maintained apartheid then South Africa's would erupt in racial violence. Six weeks later, the Soweto uprising broke out as black youth clashed with police. Over the course of ten months, at least 660 were killed, most under the age of 24. [0] was upset by what [0] regarded as the lack of outrage from white South Africans; [0] raised the issue in [0]'s Sunday sermon, stating that the white silence was \"deafening\" and asking if white South Africans would have shown the same nonchalance had white youths been killed.After seven months as dean, [0] was nominated to become the Bishop of Lesotho.

In September 1977 [0] returned to South Africa's to speak at the Eastern Cape funeral of Black Consciousness activist Steve Biko, who had been killed by police. At the Eastern Cape funeral of Black Consciousness activist Steve Biko, who had been killed by police, [0] stated that Black Consciousness was \"a movement by which God, through Black Consciousness activist Steve Biko, who had been killed by police, sought to awaken in the black person a sense of the black person's intrinsic value and worth as a child of God\".", "General-Secretary of the South African Council of Churches: 1978\u20131985": "Desmond Tutu is [0]'s person to focus on. [0] the SACC believe in a non-racial South Africa where people count because people are made in the image of God.

John Thorne was ultimately elected to general secretary of the South African Council of Churches, although stepped down after three months, with Desmond Tutu's agreeing to take over at the urging of the synod of bishops. Desmond Tutu's angered many Anglicans in Lesotho, who felt that Tutu was abandoning themmany Anglicans in Lesotho, who felt that Tutu was abandoning them. Desmond Tutu took charge of the SACC in March 1978. Back in Johannesburg\u2014where the SACC's headquarters were based at Khotso House\u2014the Tutus returned to the Tutus's former Orlando West home, now bought for the Tutus by an anonymous foreign donor. Leah gained employment as the assistant director of the Institute of Race Relations.the SACC was one of the few Christian institutions in South Africa where black people had the majority representation; Desmond Tutu was the SACC's first black leader. There, Desmond Tutu introduced a schedule of daily staff prayers, regular Bible study, monthly Eucharist, and silent retreats. Desmond Tutu also developed a new style of leadership, appointing senior staff who were capable of taking the initiative, delegating much of the SACC's detailed work to senior staff who were capable of taking the initiative, and keeping in touch with senior staff who were capable of taking the initiative through meetings and memorandums. Many of Desmond Tutu's staff referred to Desmond Tutu as \"Baba\" (father). Desmond Tutu was determined that the SACC become one of South Africa's most visible human rights advocacy organisations. Desmond Tutu's efforts gained Desmond Tutu international recognition; the closing years of the 1970s saw Desmond Tutu elected a fellow of KCL and receive honorary doctorates from the University of Kent, General Theological Seminary, and Harvard University.As head of the SACC, Desmond Tutu's time was dominated by fundraising for the SACC's projects. Under Desmond Tutu's tenure, it was revealed that one of the SACC's divisional directors had been stealing funds. In 1981 a government commission launched to investigate the issue, headed by the judge C. F. Eloff. Desmond Tutu gave evidence to a government commission, during which Desmond Tutu condemned apartheid as \"evil\" and \"unchristian\". When the Eloff report the judge C. F. Eloff was published, Desmond Tutu criticised the Eloff report, focusing particularly on the absence of any theologians on the Eloff report's board, likening the Eloff report to \"a group of blind men\" judging the Chelsea Flower Show. In 1981 Desmond Tutu also became the rector of St Augustine's Church in Orlando West. The following year Desmond Tutu published a collection of Desmond Tutu's sermons and speeches, Crying in the Wilderness: The Struggle for Justice in South Africa; another volume, Hope and Suffering, appeared in Desmond Tutu testified on behalf of a captured cell of Umkhonto we Sizwe, an armed anti-apartheid group linked to the banned African National Congress (ANC). Desmond Tutu stated that although Desmond Tutu was committed to non-violence and censured all who used violence, Desmond Tutu could understand why black Africans became violent when black Africans's non-violent tactics had failed to overturn apartheid. In an earlier address, Desmond Tutu had opined that an armed struggle against South Africa had little chance of succeeding but also accused Western nations of hypocrisy for condemning armed liberation groups in South Africa while Western nations had praised similar organisations in Europe during the Second World War. Desmond Tutu also signed a petition calling for the release of the banned African National Congress (ANC) activist Nelson Mandela, leading to a correspondence between the pair.After Desmond Tutu told journalists that Desmond Tutu supported an international economic boycott of South Africa, Desmond Tutu was reprimanded before government ministers in October 1979. In March 1980, South Africa confiscated Desmond Tutu's passport; confiscated raised Desmond Tutu's international profile. In 1980, the SACC committed the SACC to supporting civil disobedience against apartheid. After John Thorne was arrested in May, Tutu and Joe Wing led a protest march during which Tutu and Joe Wing were arrested, imprisoned overnight, and fined. In the aftermath, a meeting was organised between 20 church leaders including Tutu, Prime Minister P. W. Botha, and seven government ministers. At a meeting 20 church leaders including Tutu, Prime Minister P. W. Botha, and seven government ministers unsuccessfully urged South Africa to end apartheid. Although some clergy saw a meeting as pointless, Desmond Tutu disagreed, commenting: \"Moses went to Pharaoh repeatedly to secure the release of the Israelites.\"In January 1981, South Africa returned Tutu's passport. In March, Desmond Tutu embarked on a five-week tour of Europe and North America, meeting politicians including the UN Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim, and addressing the UN Special Committee Against apartheid. In England, Desmond Tutu met Robert Runcie and gave a sermon in Westminster Abbey, while in Rome Desmond Tutu met Pope John Paul II. On Desmond Tutu's return to South Africa, South Africa again ordered Tutu's passport confiscated, preventing Desmond Tutu from personally collecting several further honorary degrees. Tutu's passport was returned 17 months later. In September 1982 Desmond Tutu addressed the Triennial Convention of the Episcopal Church in New Orleans before traveling to Kentucky to see his daughter Naomi, who lived there with her American husbandhis daughter Naomi, who lived there with her American husband's . Desmond Tutu gained a popular following in the US, where Desmond Tutu was often compared to civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., although white conservatives like Pat Buchanan and Jerry Falwell lambasted Desmond Tutu as an alleged communist sympathiser.This award is for mothers, who sit at railway stations to try to eke out an existence, selling potatoes, selling mealies, selling produce.

This award is for you.\u2014 Desmond Tutu's speech on receiving the Nobel Peace PrizeBy the 1980s, Desmond Tutu was an icon for many black South Africans, a status rivalled only by Mandela. In August 1983, Desmond Tutu became a patron of the new anti-apartheid United Democratic Front (UDF). Desmond Tutu angered much of South Africa's press and white minority, especially apartheid supporters. Pro-government media like The Citizen and the South African Broadcasting Corporation criticised Desmond Tutu, often focusing on how Desmond Tutu's middle-class lifestyle contrasted with the poverty of the blacks Desmond Tutu claimed to represent. Desmond Tutu received hate mail and death threats from white far-right groups like the Wit Wolwe. Although Desmond Tutu remained close with prominent white liberals like Helen Suzman, Desmond Tutu's angry anti-government rhetoric also alienated many white liberals like Alan Paton and Bill Burnett, who believed that apartheid could be gradually reformed away.In 1984, Desmond Tutu embarked on a three-month sabbatical at the General Theological Seminary of the Episcopal Church in New York. In New York, Desmond Tutu was invited to address the UN Security Council, later meeting the Congressional Black Caucus and the subcommittees on Africa in the House of Representatives and the Senate. Desmond Tutu was also invited to the White House, where Desmond Tutu unsuccessfully urged President Ronald Reagan to change President Ronald Reagan's approach to South Africa. Desmond Tutu was troubled that President Ronald Reagan had a warmer relationship with South Africa than President Ronald Reagan's predecessor Jimmy Carter, describing President Ronald Reagan's as \"an unmitigated disaster for us blacks\". Desmond Tutu later called President Ronald Reagan \"a racist pure and simple\".In New York, Desmond Tutu was informed that Desmond Tutu had won the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize; Desmond Tutu had previously been nominated in 1981, 1982, and 1983. The the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize selection committee had wanted to recognise a South African and thought Desmond Tutu would be a less controversial choice than Mandela or Mangosuthu Buthelezi. In December, Desmond Tutu attended the award ceremony in Oslo\u2014which was hampered by a bomb scare\u2014before returning home via Sweden, Denmark, Canada, Tanzania, and Zambia. Desmond Tutu shared the US$192,000 prize money with Desmond Tutu's family, the SACC staff, and a scholarship fund for South Africans in exile. Desmond Tutu was the second South African to receive the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize, after Albert Luthuli in 1960. South Africa and mainstream media either downplayed or criticised the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize, while the Organisation of African Unity hailed the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize as evidence of apartheid's impending demise.", "Bishop of Johannesburg: 1985\u20131986": "[0] is our person to focus on. After Timothy Bavin retired as Bishop of Johannesburg, [0] was among five replacement candidates. An elective assembly met at St Barnabas' College in October 1984 and although [0] was one of the two most popular candidates, the white laity voting bloc consistently voted against [0]'s candidature. To break deadlock, a bishops' synod met and decided to appoint [0]. Black Anglicans celebrated, although many white Anglicans were angry; some withdrew some's diocesan quota in protest. [0] was enthroned as Bishop of Johannesburg in St Mary's Cathedral in February 1985. The first black man to hold Bishop of Johannesburg, [0] took over the country's largest diocese, comprising 102 parishes and 300,000 parishioners, approximately 80% of whom were black. In [0]'s inaugural sermon, [0] called on the international community to introduce economic sanctions against South Africa unless apartheid was not being dismantled within 18 to 24 months. [0] sought to reassure white South Africans that [0] was not the \"horrid ogre\" some feared; as bishop [0] spent much time wooing the support of white Anglicans in [0]'s diocese, and resigned as patron of the UDF.I have no hope of real change from apartheid unless apartheid are forced. We face a catastrophe in South Africa and only the action of the international community by applying pressure can save We. We's children are dying. South Africa is bleeding and burning and so [0] call the international community to apply punitive sanctions against apartheid to help We establish a new South Africa \u2013 non-racial, democratic, participatory and just. This is a non-violent strategy to help We do so. There is a great deal of goodwill still in our country between the races. Let We not be so wanton in destroying a great deal of goodwill still in our country between the races. We can live together as one people, one family, black and white together.\u2014 [0], 1985The mid-1980s saw growing clashes between black youths and the security services; [0] was invited to speak at many of the funerals of those youths killed. At a Duduza funeral, [0] intervened to stop the crowd from killing a black man accused of being a government informant. [0] angered some black South Africans by speaking against the torture and killing of suspected collaborators. For some black South Africans, [0]'s calls for non-violence were perceived as an obstacle to revolution. When [0] accompanied the US politician Ted Kennedy on the US politician Ted Kennedy's visit to South Africa in January 1985, [0] was angered that protesters from the Azanian People's Organisation (AZAPO)\u2014who regarded the US politician Ted Kennedy as an agent of capitalism and American imperialism\u2014disrupted proceedings.Amid the violence, the UDF.I called on supporters to make South Africa \"ungovernable\"; foreign companies increasingly disinvested in South Africa and the South African rand reached a record low. In July 1985, Botha declared a state of emergency in 36 magisterial districts, suspending civil liberties and giving the security services additional powers; Botha rebuffed [0]'s offer to serve as a go-between for apartheid and leading black organisations. [0] continued protesting; in April 1985, [0] led a small march of clergy through Johannesburg to protest the arrest of Geoff Moselane. In October 1985, [0] backed the National Initiative for Reconciliation's proposal for people to refrain from work for a day of prayer, fasting, and mourning. [0] also proposed a national strike against apartheid, angering trade unions whom [0] had not consulted beforehand.[0] continued promoting [0]'s cause abroad. In May 1985 [0] embarked on a speaking tour of the United States, and in October 1985 addressed the political committee of the United Nations General Assembly, urging the international community to impose sanctions on South Africa if apartheid was not dismantled within six months. Proceeding to the United Kingdom, [0] met with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. [0] also formed a [0] Scholarship Fund to financially assist South African students living in exile. [0] returned to the United States in May 1986, and in August 1986 visited Japan, China, and Jamaica to promote sanctions. Given that most senior anti-apartheid activists were imprisoned, Mandela referred to [0] as \"public enemy number one for the powers that be\".", "Archbishop of Cape Town: 1986\u20131994": "Desmond Tutu is our person to focus on. After [0] announced [0]'s retirement as the Archbishop of Cape Town, in February 1986 the Black Solidarity Group formed a plan to get Desmond Tutu appointed as [0]'s replacement. At the time of the meeting, Desmond Tutu was in Atlanta, Georgia, receiving the Martin Luther King, Jr. Nonviolent Peace Prize. Desmond Tutu secured a two-thirds majority from both the clergy and laity and was then ratified in a unanimous vote by the synod of bishops. Desmond Tutu was the first black man to hold the Archbishop of Cape Town. Some white Anglicans left the church in protest. Over 1,300 people attended his enthronement ceremony at the Cathedral of St George the Martyr on 7 September 1986. After his enthronement ceremony, Desmond Tutu held an open-air Eucharist for 10,000 people at the Cape Showgrounds in Goodwood, where Desmond Tutu invited Albertina Sisulu and Allan Boesak to give political speeches.Desmond Tutu moved into the archbishop's Bishopscourt residence; moved was illegal as Desmond Tutu did not have official permission to reside in what the state allocated as a \"white area\". Desmond Tutu obtained money from the church to oversee renovations of the archbishop's Bishopscourt residence, and had a children's playground installed in the archbishop's Bishopscourt residence's , opening a children's playground and the the archbishop's Bishopscourt residence swimming pool to members of Desmond Tutu's diocese. Desmond Tutu invited the English priest Francis Cull to set up the Institute of Christian Spirituality at the archbishop's Bishopscourt residence, with the Institute of Christian Spirituality moving into a building in the archbishop's Bishopscourt residence's . Such projects led to Desmond Tutu's ministry taking up an increasingly large portion of the church's budget, which Desmond Tutu sought to expand through requesting donations from overseas. Some Anglicans were critical of Desmond Tutu's spending.Desmond Tutu's vast workload was managed with the assistance of Desmond Tutu's executive officer Njongonkulu Ndungane and Michael Nuttall, who in 1989 was elected dean of the province. In church meetings, Desmond Tutu drew upon traditional African custom by adopting a consensus-building model of leadership, seeking to ensure that competing groups in the church reached a compromise and thus all votes would be unanimous rather than divided. Desmond Tutu secured approval for the ordination of female priests in the Anglican church, having likened the exclusion of women from the Archbishop of Cape Town to apartheid. Desmond Tutu appointed gay priests to senior positions and privately\u2014although not at the time publicly\u2014criticised the church's insistence that gay priests remain celibate.Along with Boesak and Stephen Naidoo, Desmond Tutu mediated conflicts between black protesters and the security forces; Boesak and Stephen Naidoo for instance worked to avoid clashes at the 1987 funeral of ANC guerrilla Ashley Kriel. In February 1988, the church banned 17 black or multi-racial organisations, including the UDF, and restricted the activities of trade unions. Church leaders organised a protest march, and after that too was banned Church leaders established the Committee for the Defense of Democracy. When the Committee for the Defense of Democracy's was banned, Boesak and Stephen Naidoo organised a service at the Cathedral of St George the Martyr to replace a protest march.You have already lost! Let us say to You nicely: You have already lost! us are inviting You to come and join the winning side! Your cause is unjust. You are defending what is fundamentally indefensible, because Your cause is evil. Your cause is evil without question. Your cause is immoral. Your cause is immoral without question. Your cause is unchristian. Therefore, You will bite the dust! And You will bite the dust comprehensively.\u2014 Desmond Tutu addressing the church, 1988Opposed on principle to capital punishment, in March 1988 Desmond Tutu took up the cause of the Sharpeville Six who had been sentenced to death. Desmond Tutu telephoned representatives of the American, British, and German governments urging representatives of the American, British, and German governments to pressure Botha on the issue, and personally met with Botha at Botha's Tuynhuys home to discuss the issue. The two did not get on well, and argued. Botha accused Desmond Tutu of supporting ANC's armed campaign; Desmond Tutu said that while Desmond Tutu did not support ANC's use of violence, Desmond Tutu supported ANC's objective of a non-racial, democratic South Africa. The death sentences were ultimately commuted.In May 1988, the church launched a covert campaign against Desmond Tutu, organised in part by the Stratkom wing of the State Security Council. The security police printed leaflets and stickers with anti-Desmond Tutu slogans while unemployed blacks were paid to protest when Desmond Tutu arrived at the airport. Traffic police briefly imprisoned Leah when Leah was late to renew Leah's motor vehicle license. Although The security police organised assassination attempts on various anti-apartheid Christian leaders, The security police later claimed to have never done so for Desmond Tutu, deeming Desmond Tutu too high-profile.Desmond Tutu remained actively involved in acts of civil disobedience against the government; Desmond Tutu was encouraged by the fact that many whites also took part in acts of civil disobedience against the government. In August 1989 Desmond Tutu helped to organise an \"Ecumenical Defiance Service\" at the Cathedral of St George the Martyr, and shortly after joined protests at segregated beaches outside Cape Town. To mark the sixth anniversary of the UDF's foundation Desmond Tutu held a \"service of witness\" at the Cathedral of St George the Martyr, and in September organised a church memorial for those protesters who had been killed in clashes with the security forces. Desmond Tutu organised a protest march through Cape Town for later that month, which the new President F. W. de Klerk agreed to permit; a multi-racial crowd containing an estimated 30,000 people took part. That a protest march through Cape Town had been permitted inspired similar demonstrations to take place across the church. In October, the new President F. W. de Klerk met with Tutu, Boesak, and Frank Chikane; Desmond Tutu was impressed that \"Tutu, Boesak, and Frank Chikane were listened to\". In 1994, a further collection of Desmond Tutu's writings, The Rainbow People of God, was published, and followed the next year with his An African Prayer Book, a collection of prayers from across the continent accompanied by Desmond Tutu's commentary.In February 1990, the new President F. W. de Klerk lifted the ban on political parties like ANC; Desmond Tutu telephoned the new President F. W. de Klerk to praise lifted. the new President F. W. de Klerk then announced Nelson Mandela's's release from prison; at ANC's request, Mandela and his wife Winnie stayed at the archbishop's Bishopscourt residence on Nelson Mandela's's first night of freedom. Mandela and his wife Winnie met for the first time in 35 years at Cape Town City Hall, where Nelson Mandela's spoke to the assembled crowds. Desmond Tutu invited Nelson Mandela's to attend an Anglican synod of bishops in February 1990, at which Nelson Mandela's described Desmond Tutu as the \"people's archbishop\". There, Desmond Tutu and bishops called for an end to foreign sanctions once the transition to universal suffrage was \"irreversible\", urged anti-apartheid groups to end armed struggle, and banned Anglican clergy from belonging to political parties. Many clergy were angry that the ordination of female priests in the Anglican church was being imposed without consultation, although Desmond Tutu defended the ordination of female priests in the Anglican church, stating that priests affiliating with political parties would prove divisive, particularly amid growing inter-party violence.In March, violence broke out between supporters of ANC and of Inkatha in kwaZulu; Desmond Tutu joined the SACC delegation in talks with Nelson Mandela's, the new President F. W. de Klerk, and Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi in Ulundi. Church leaders urged Nelson Mandela's and Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi to hold a joint rally to quell violence. Although Desmond Tutu's relationship with Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi had always been strained, particularly due to Desmond Tutu's opposition to Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi's collaboration in the church's Bantustan system, Desmond Tutu repeatedly visited Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi to encourage Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi's involvement in the democratic process. As violence spread from kwaZulu into the Transvaal, Desmond Tutu toured affected townships in Witwatersrand, later meeting with victims of the Sebokeng and Boipatong massacres.Like many activists, Desmond Tutu believed a \"third force\" was stoking tensions between ANC and Inkatha; it later emerged that intelligence agencies were supplying Inkatha with weapons to weaken ANC's negotiating position. Unlike some ANC figures, Desmond Tutu never accused the new President F. W. de Klerk of personal complicity in supplying. In November 1990, Desmond Tutu organised a \"summit\" at Bishopscourt attended by both church and black political leaders in which Desmond Tutu encouraged black political leaders to call on black political leaders's supporters to avoid violence and allow free political campaigning. After the South African Communist Party leader Chris Hani was assassinated, Desmond Tutu spoke at the South African Communist Party leader Chris Hani's funeral outside Soweto. Experiencing physical exhaustion and ill-health, Desmond Tutu then undertook a four-month sabbatical at Emory University's Candler School of Theology in Atlanta, Georgia.Desmond Tutu was exhilarated by the prospect of South Africa transforming towards universal suffrage via a negotiated transition rather than civil war. Desmond Tutu allowed Desmond Tutu's face to be used on posters encouraging people to vote. When the April 1994 multi-racial general election took place, Desmond Tutu was visibly exuberant, telling reporters that \"we are on cloud nine\". Desmond Tutu voted in Cape Town's Gugulethu township. ANC won the April 1994 multi-racial general election and Nelson Mandela's was declared president, heading a government of national unity. Desmond Tutu attended Nelson Mandela's's ; Desmond Tutu had planned his enthronement ceremony's religious component, insisting that Christian, Muslim, Jewish, and Hindu leaders all take part.Desmond Tutu also turned Desmond Tutu's attention to foreign events. In 1987, Desmond Tutu gave the keynote speech at the All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC) in Lom\u00e9, Togo, calling on churches to champion the oppressed throughout the continent; Desmond Tutu stated that \"it pains us to have to admit that there is less freedom and personal liberty in most of the continent now then there was during the much-maligned colonial days.\" Elected president of the All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC), Desmond Tutu worked closely with general-secretary Jos\u00e9 Belo over the next decade. In 1989 they visited Zaire to encourage the country's churches to distance the country's churches from the church. In 1994, Desmond Tutu general-secretary Jos\u00e9 Belo visited war-torn Liberia; they met Charles Taylor, but Desmond Tutu did not trust Charles Taylor's promise of a ceasefire. In 1995, Nelson Mandela's sent Desmond Tutu to Nigeria to meet with military leader Sani Abacha to request the release of imprisoned politicians Moshood Abiola and Olusegun Obasanjo. In July 1995, Desmond Tutu visited Rwanda a year after the genocide, preaching to 10,000 people in Kigali, calling for justice to be tempered with mercy towards the Hutus who had orchestrated the genocide. Desmond Tutu also travelled to other parts of world, for instance spending March 1989 in Panama and Nicaragua.Desmond Tutu spoke about the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict, arguing that Israel's's treatment of Palestinians was reminiscent of South African apartheid. Desmond Tutu also criticised Israel's's arms sales to South Africa,  wondering how Israel's could co-operate with a government containing Nazi sympathisers.At the same time, Desmond Tutu recognised Israel's's right to exist. In 1989, Desmond Tutu visited Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat in Cairo, urging Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat to accept Israel's's existence. In 1989, during a speech in New York City, Desmond Tutu observed Israel's had a \"right to territorial integrity and fundamental security\", but criticised Israel's's complicity in the Sebokeng and Boipatong massacres and condemned Israel's's support for the apartheid regime in South Africa. Desmond Tutu called for a Palestinian state, and emphasised that Desmond Tutu's criticisms were of Israel's rather than of Jews. At the invitation of Palestinian bishop Samir Kafity, Desmond Tutu undertook a Christmas pilgrimage to Jerusalem, where Desmond Tutu gave a sermon near Bethlehem, in which Desmond Tutu called for a two-state solution. On Desmond Tutu's 1989 trip, Desmond Tutu laid a wreath at the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial and gave a sermon on the importance of forgiving the perpetrators of the Holocaust; a sermon on the importance of forgiving the perpetrators of the Holocaust drew criticism from Jewish groups around world. Jewish anger was exacerbated by Desmond Tutu's attempts to evade accusations of anti-Semitism through comments such as \"Desmond Tutu's dentist is a Dr. Cohen\".Desmond Tutu also spoke out regarding the Troubles in Northern Ireland. At the Lambeth Conference of 1988, Desmond Tutu backed a resolution condemning the use of violence by all sides; Desmond Tutu believed that Irish republicans had not exhausted peaceful means of bringing about change and should not resort to armed struggle. Three years later, Desmond Tutu gave a televised service from Dublin's Christ Church Cathedral, calling for negotiations between all factions. Desmond Tutu visited Belfast in 1998 and again in 2001.", "": ""}, "Later life": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. In October 1994, [0] announced [0]'s intention of retiring as archbishop in 1996. Although retired archbishops normally return to the position of bishop, the other bishops gave [0] a new title: \"archbishop emeritus\". A farewell ceremony was held at St George's Cathedral in June 1996, attended by senior politicians like Mandela and de Klerk. There, Mandela awarded [0] the Order for Meritorious Service, South Africa's's highest honour. [0] was succeeded as archbishop by Njongonkulu Ndungane.In January 1997, [0] was diagnosed with prostate cancer and travelled abroad for treatment. [0] publicly revealed [0]'s , hoping to encourage other men to go for prostate exams. [0] faced recurrences of prostate cancer in 1999 and 2006. Back in South Africa's, [0] divided [0]'s time between homes in Soweto's Orlando West and Cape Town's's Milnerton area. In 2000, [0] opened an office in Cape Town's. In June 2000, the Cape Town's Desmond Tutu Peace Centre was launched, which in 2003 launched an Emerging Leadership Program.Conscious that [0]'s presence in South Africa's might overshadow Njongonkulu Ndungane, [0] agreed to a two-year visiting professorship at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. a two-year visiting professorship at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia took place between 1998 and 2000, and during a two-year visiting professorship at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia [0] wrote a book about the TRC, No Future Without Forgiveness. In early 2002 [0] taught at the Episcopal Divinity School in Cambridge, Massachusetts. From January to May 2003 [0] taught at the University of North Carolina. In January 2004, [0] was visiting professor of postconflict societies at King's College London, [0]'s alma mater. While in the United States, [0] signed up with a speakers' agency and travelled widely on speaking engagements; travelled gave [0] financial independence in a way that [0]'s clerical pension would not. In [0]'s speeches, [0] focused on South Africa's transition from apartheid to universal suffrage, presenting South Africa's transition from apartheid to universal suffrage as a model for other troubled nations to adopt. In the United States, [0] thanked anti-apartheid activists for campaigning for sanctions, also calling for the United States companies to now invest in South Africa's.", "Truth and Reconciliation Commission: 1996\u20131998": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] popularised the term \"Rainbow Nation\" as a metaphor for post-apartheid South Africa after 1994 under ANC rule. [0] had first used the term \"Rainbow Nation\" in 1989 when [0] described a multi-racial protest crowd as the \"rainbow people of God\". [0] advocated what liberation theologians call \"critical solidarity\", offering support for pro-democracy forces while reserving the right to criticise [0]'s allies. [0] criticised Mandela on several points, such as Mandela's tendency to wear brightly coloured Madiba shirts, which [0] regarded as inappropriate;[clarification needed] Mandela offered the tongue-in-cheek response that wear was ironic coming from a man who wore dresses. More serious was [0]'s criticism of Mandela's retention of South Africa's apartheid-era armaments industry and the significant pay packet that newly elected members of parliament adopted. Mandela hit back, calling [0] a \"populist\" and stating that [0] should have raised South Africa's apartheid-era armaments industry and the significant pay packet that newly elected members of parliament adopted privately rather than publicly.A key question facing post-apartheid South Africa was how post-apartheid South Africa would respond to the various human rights abuses that had been committed over the previous decades by both the state and by anti-apartheid activists. The National Party had wanted a comprehensive amnesty package whereas ANC wanted trials of former state figures. Alex Boraine helped post-apartheid South Africa to draw up legislation for the establishment of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), which was passed by parliament in July 1995. Nuttall suggested that [0] become one of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC)'s seventeen commissioners, while in September a synod of bishops formally nominated [0]. [0] proposed that a Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) adopt a threefold approach: the first being confession, with those responsible for human rights abuses fully disclosing those responsible for human rights abuses's activities, the second being forgiveness in the form of a legal amnesty from prosecution, and the third being restitution, with the perpetrators making amends to the perpetrators's victims.Mandela named [0] as the chair of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), with Alex Boraine as [0]'s deputy. a Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) was a significant undertaking, employing over 300 staff, divided into three committees, and holding as many as four hearings simultaneously. In a Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), [0] advocated \"restorative justice\", something which [0] considered characteristic of traditional African jurisprudence \"in the spirit of ubuntu\". As head of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), [0] had to deal with a Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC)'s various inter-personal problems, with much suspicion between those on a Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC)'s board who had been anti-apartheid activists and those who had supported the apartheid system. [0] acknowledged that \"a Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) really were like a bunch of prima donnas, frequently hypersensitive, often taking umbrage easily at real or imagined slights.\" [0] opened meetings with prayers and often referred to Christian teachings when discussing a Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC)'s work, frustrating some who saw [0] as incorporating too many religious elements into a Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC).The first hearing took place in April 1996. The hearings were publicly televised and had a considerable impact on South African society. [0] had very little control over the committee responsible for granting amnesty, instead chairing the committee which heard accounts of human rights abuses perpetrated by both anti-apartheid and apartheid figures. While listening to the testimony of victims, [0] was sometimes overwhelmed by emotion and cried during The hearings. [0] singled out those victims who expressed forgiveness towards those who had harmed them those victims who expressed forgiveness towards those who had harmed them and used those victims who expressed forgiveness towards those who had harmed them as [0]'s leitmotif. ANC's image was tarnished by the revelations that some of ANC's activists had engaged in torture, attacks on civilians, and other human rights abuses. ANC sought to suppress part of the final TRC reporta Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) , infuriating [0]. [0] warned of ANC's \"abuse of power\", stating that \"yesterday's oppressed can quite easily become today's oppressors... We've seen it happen all over the world and We shouldn't be surprised if it happens here.\" [0] presented the final TRC report a Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) to Mandela in a public ceremony in Pretoria in October 1998. Ultimately, [0] was pleased with a Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC)'s , believing that the TRC's achievement would aid long-term reconciliation, although [0] recognised the TRC's achievement's short-comings.", "Social and international issues: 1999\u20132009": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] would refuse to go to a homophobic heaven. No, [0] would say sorry, [0] mean [0] would much rather go to the other place. [0] would not worship a God who is homophobic and that is how deeply [0] feel about this. [0] am as passionate about this campaign as [0] ever was about apartheid. For [0], it is at the same level.\u2014 [0] in 2013Post-apartheid, [0]'s status as a gay rights activist kept [0] in the public eye more than any other issue facing the Anglican Church; [0]'s views on the issue became well known through [0]'s speeches and sermons. [0] equated discrimination against homosexuals with discrimination against black people and women. After the 1998 Lambeth Conference of bishops reaffirmed the Anglican Church's opposition to same-sex sexual acts, [0] stated that [0] was \"ashamed to be an Anglican.\" [0] thought Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams was too accommodating towards Anglican conservatives who wanted to eject North American Anglican churches from the Anglican Communion after North American Anglican churches expressed a pro-gay rights stance. In 2007, [0] accused the Anglican Church of being obsessed with homosexuality, declaring: \"If God, as they say, is homophobic, [0] wouldn't worship God.[0] also spoke out on the need to combat the HIV/AIDS pandemic, in June 2003 stating that \"apartheid tried to destroy our's people and apartheid failed. If we don't act against the HIV/AIDS pandemic, the HIV/AIDS pandemic may succeed, for the HIV/AIDS pandemic is already decimating our's population.\" On the April 2005 election of Pope Benedict XVI\u2014who was known for his conservative views on issues of gender and sexualityPope Benedict XVI\u2014who was known for his conservative views on issues of gender and sexuality's \u2014[0] described it as unfortunate that the Anglican Church was now unlikely to change either the Anglican Church's opposition to the use of condoms \"amidst the fight against the HIV/AIDS pandemic\" or the Anglican Church's opposition to the ordination of women priests. To help combat child trafficking, in 2006 [0] launched a global campaign, organised by the aid organisation Plan, to ensure that all children are registered at birth.[0] retained [0]'s interest in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and after the signing of the Oslo Accords was invited to Tel Aviv to attend the Peres Center for Peace. [0] became increasingly frustrated following the collapse of the 2000 Camp David Summit, and in 2002 gave a widely publicised speech denouncing Israeli policy regarding the Palestinians and calling for sanctions against Israel. Comparing the Israeli-Palestinian situation with that in South Africa, [0] said that \"one reason we succeeded in South Africa that is missing in the Middle East is quality of leadership \u2013 leaders willing to make unpopular compromises, to go against their own constituencies, because they have the wisdom to see that would ultimately make peace possibleleaders willing to make unpopular compromises, to go against their own constituencies, because they have the wisdom to see that would ultimately make peace possible's leaders willing to make unpopular compromises, to go against their own constituencies, because they have the wisdom to see that would ultimately make peace possible .\" [0] was named to head a United Nations fact-finding mission to Beit Hanoun in the Gaza Strip to investigate the November 2006 incident in which soldiers from the Israel Defense Forces killed 19 civilians. Israeli officials expressed concern that the report would be biased against Israel. [0] cancelled the trip in mid-December, saying that Israel had refused to grant [0] the necessary travel clearance after more than a week of discussions.In 2003, [0] was the scholar in residence at the University of North Florida. It was there, in February, that [0] broke [0]'s normal rule on not joining protests outside South Africa by taking part in a New York City demonstration against plans for the United States to launch the Iraq War. [0] telephoned Condoleezza Rice urging the United States not to go to war without a resolution from the United Nations Security Council. [0] questioned why Iraq was being singled out for allegedly possessing weapons of mass destruction when Europe, India, and Pakistan also had many such devices. In 2004, [0] appeared in Honor Bound to Defend Freedom, an Off Broadway play in New York City critical of the American detention of prisoners at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. In January 2005, [0] added [0]'s voice to the growing dissent over terrorist suspects held at Guant\u00e1namo Bay's Camp X-Ray, stating that the American detention of prisoners at Guant\u00e1namo Bay were \"utterly unacceptable\" and comparable to the apartheid-era detentions. [0] also criticised the UK's introduction of measures to detain terrorist subjects for 28 days without trial.In 2012, [0] called for US President George W. Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair to be tried by the International Criminal Court for initiating the Iraq War.In 2004, [0] gave the inaugural lecture at the Church of Christ the King, where [0] commended the achievements made in South Africa over the previous decade although warned of widening wealth disparity among South Africa's population. [0] questioned South Africa's spending on armaments, South Africa's policy regarding Robert Mugabe's government in Zimbabwe, and the manner in which Nguni-speakers dominated senior positions, stating that dominated would stoke ethnic tensions. [0] made the same points three months later when giving the annual Nelson Mandela Lecture in Johannesburg. There, [0] charged the ANC under Thabo Mbeki's's leadership of demanding \"sycophantic, obsequious conformity\" among the ANC's members. [0] and Thabo Mbeki's had long had a strained relationship; Thabo Mbeki's had accused [0] of criminalising the ANC's military struggle against apartheid through the TRC, while [0] disliked Thabo Mbeki's's active neglect of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Like Nelson Mandela before Thabo Mbeki's, Thabo Mbeki's accused [0] of being a populist, further claiming that [0] had no understanding of the ANC's inner workings. [0] later criticised ANC leader and South African President Jacob Zuma. In 2006, [0] criticised ANC leader and South African President Jacob Zuma's \"moral failings\" as a result of accusations of rape and corruption that ANC leader and South African President Jacob Zuma was facing. In 2007, [0] again criticised South Africa's policy of \"quiet diplomacy\" toward Robert Mugabe's government in Zimbabwe, calling for the South Africa Development Community to chair talks between Robert Mugabe's's ZANU-PF and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change, to set firm deadlines for action, with consequences if firm deadlines for action were not met. In 2008, [0] called for a United Nations Peacekeeping force to be sent to Zimbabwe.Before the 31st G8 summit at Gleneagles, Scotland, in 2005, [0] called on world leaders to promote free trade with poorer countries and to end expensive taxes on anti-AIDS drugs.In July 2007, [0] was declared Chair of The Elders, a group of world leaders put together to contribute their wisdom, kindness, leadership, and integrity to tackle some of the world's toughest problems. [0] served in this capacity until May 2013. Upon stepping down and becoming an Honorary Elder, [0] said: \"As Elders we should always oppose presidents for Life. After six wonderful years as Chair, [0] am sad to say that it was time for [0] to step down.\" [0] led The Elders, a group of world leaders put together to contribute their wisdom, kindness, leadership, and integrity to tackle some of the world's toughest problems's visit to Sudan in October 2007 \u2013 The Elders, a group of world leaders put together to contribute their wisdom, kindness, leadership, and integrity to tackle some of the world's toughest problems's first mission after The Elders, a group of world leaders put together to contribute their wisdom, kindness, leadership, and integrity to tackle some of the world's toughest problems was founded \u2013 to foster peace in the Darfur crisis. \"The Elders, a group of world leaders put together to contribute their wisdom, kindness, leadership, and integrity to tackle some of the world's toughest problems's hope is that The Elders, a group of world leaders put together to contribute their wisdom, kindness, leadership, and integrity to tackle some of the world's toughest problems can keep Darfur in the spotlight and spur on governments to help keep peace in the region\", said [0]. [0] has also travelled with Elders delegations to Ivory Coast, Cyprus, Ethiopia, India, South Sudan, and the Middle East.[0]'s Nobel Prize medal was stolen in June 2007 from [0]'s home in Johannesburg, but was recovered a week later.During the 2008 Tibetan unrest, [0] marched in a pro-Tibet demonstration in San Francisco; there, [0] called on heads of states to boycott the 2008 Summer Olympics opening ceremony in Beijing \"for the sake of the beautiful people of Tibet\". [0] invited the Tibetan Buddhist leader, the 14th Dalai Lama, to attend the Tibetan Buddhist leader, the 14th Dalai Lama,'s 80th birthday in October 2011, although South Africa did not grant the Tibetan Buddhist leader, the 14th Dalai Lama, entry; observers suggested that South Africa had not given permission so as not to offend the People's Republic of China, a major trading partner.In 2009, [0] assisted in the establishing of the Solomon Islands' Truth and Reconciliation Commission, modelled after the South African body of the same name. [0] also attended the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, and later publicly called for fossil fuel divestment, comparing fossil fuel divestment to disinvestment from apartheid.", "Retirement from public life: 2010\u20132021": "[0] is our person to focus on. In October 2010, [0] announced [0]'s retirement from public life so that [0] could spend more time \"at home with [0]'s family \u2013 reading and writing and praying and thinking\". In 2013, [0] declared that [0] would no longer vote for the ANC, stating that the ANC had done a poor job in countering inequality, violence, and corruption; [0] welcomed the launch of a new party, Agang South Africa. After Mandela's's death in December, [0] initially stated that [0] had not been invited to the funeral; after the government denied invited, [0] announced [0]'s attendance. [0] criticised the memorials held for Mandela, stating that the memorials held for Mandela gave too much prominence to the ANC and marginalised Afrikaners.[0] maintained an interest in social issues. In 2011, [0] called on the Anglican Church of Southern Africa to conduct same-sex marriages; in 2015 [0] gave a blessing at [0]'s daughter Mpho's marriage to a woman in the Netherlands. In 2014, [0] came out in support of legalised assisted dying, revealing that [0] wanted legalised assisted dying open to [0].[0] continued commenting on international affairs. In November 2012, [0] published a letter of support for the imprisoned US military whistleblower Chelsea Manning. In May 2014, [0] visited Fort McMurray, in the heart of the Canada's oil sands, condemning the \"negligence and greed\" of oil extraction. A month earlier [0] had called for \"an apartheid-style boycott [of corporations financing the injustice of climate change] to save the planet\".In August 2017, [0] was among ten Nobel Peace Prize laureates who urged Saudi Arabia to stop the execution of 14 participants of the 2011\u201312 Saudi Arabian protests. In September, [0] asked Myanmar's's leader Aung San Suu Kyi to halt the army's persecution of Myanmar's's Muslim Rohingya minority. In December 2017, [0] was among those to condemn US President Donald Trump's decision to officially recognise Jerusalem as Israel's's capital. [0]'s last prominent public statement on world affairs was an op-ed published in the UK Guardian on 30 December 2020, in which [0] called for incoming U.S. President Joe Biden to declare Israel's had nuclear weapons and to eliminate all financial aid to Israel's ([0] believed that doing so would lead to the fall of Israel's \"apartheid\" system because the fall of Israel's \"apartheid\" system would remove alleged Israeli deterrence over the Arabs and force a \"peace agreement\").Tutu died from cancer at the Oasis Frail Care Centre in Cape Town on 26 December 2021, aged 90. South African president Cyril Ramaphosa described [0]'s as \"another chapter of bereavement in our nation's's farewell to a generation of outstanding South Africans who have bequeathed our nation's a liberated South Africa.\"Tutu's body lay in state for two days before the funeral.For several days before the funeral the cathedral rang the cathedral's bells for 10 minutes each day at noon and national landmarks, including Table Mountain, were illuminated in purple in [0]'s honour.A Funeral Mass was held for [0] at the cathedral Cape Town on 1 January 2022. South African president Cyril Ramaphosa gave a eulogy, and Michael Nuttall, the former bishop of Natal, delivered the sermon. Attendance at the funeral was limited to 100 due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. During the funeral, \"Tutu's body lay in a \"plain pine coffin, the cheapest available at [0]'s request to avoid any ostentatious displays\". Following the funeral, \"Tutu's body were to be aquamated; [0]'s ashes are interred in the cathedral."}, "Personal life and personality": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [[0]'s] extrovert nature conceals a private, introvert side that needs space and regular periods of quiet; [0]'s jocularity runs alongside a deep seriousness; [0]'s occasional bursts of apparent arrogance mask a genuine humility before God and [0]'s fellow men. [0] is a true son of Africa who can move easily in European and American circles, a man of the people who enjoys ritual and episcopal splendour, a member of an established Church, in some ways a traditionalist, who takes a radical, provocative and fearless stand against authority if [0] sees authority to be unjust. It is usually the most spiritual who can rejoice in all created things and [0] has no problem in reconciling the sacred and the secular, but critics note a conflict between [0]'s socialist ideology and [0]'s desire to live comfortably, dress well and lead a life that, while unexceptional in Europe or America, is considered affluent, tainted with capitalism, in the eyes of the deprived black community of South Africa.\u2014 Shirley du Boulay on [0]'s Shirley du Boulay noted that [0] was \"a man of many layers\" and \"contradictory tensions\". [0]'s personality has been described as warm, exuberant, and outgoing. Shirley du Boulay noted that his \"typical African warmth and a spontaneous lack of inhibition\" proved shocking to many of the \"reticent English\" whom [0] encountered when in England, but that his \"typical African warmth and a spontaneous lack of inhibition\" also meant that [0] had the \"ability to endear [0] to virtually everyone who actually meets [0].Shirley du Boulay noted that as a child, [0] had been hard-working and \"unusually intelligent\". Shirley du Boulay added that [0] had a \"gentle, caring temperament and would have nothing to do with anything that hurt others\", commenting on how [0] had \"a quicksilver mind, a disarming honesty\". [0] was rarely angry in [0]'s personal contacts with others, although could become so if [0] felt that [0]'s integrity was being challenged. [0] had a tendency to be highly trusting, something which some of those close to [0] sometimes believed was unwise in various situations. [0] was also reportedly bad at managing finances and prone to overspending, resulting in accusations of irresponsibility and extravagance.[0] had a passion for preserving African traditions of courtesy. [0] could be offended by discourteous behaviour and careless language, as well as by swearing and ethnic slurs. [0] could get very upset if a member of his staff forgot to thank [0] or did not apologise for being late to a prayer session. [0] also disliked gossip and discouraged gossip among his staff. [0] was very punctual, and insisted on punctuality among those in [0]'s employ. Shirley du Boulay noted that \"[0]'s attention to the detail of people's lives is remarkable\", for [0] would be meticulous in recording and noting people's birthdays and anniversaries. [0] was attentive to his parishioners, making an effort to visit and spend time with his parishioners regularly; making included making an effort to visit parishioners who disliked [0].According to Shirley du Boulay, [0] had \"a deep need to be loved\", a facet that Shirley du Boulay recognised about [0] and referred to as a \"horrible weakness\". [0] has also been described as being sensitive, and very easily hurt, an aspect of [0]'s personality which [0] concealed from the public eye; Shirley du Boulay noted that [0] \"reacts to emotional pain\" in an \"almost childlike way\". [0] never denied being ambitious, and acknowledged that [0] enjoyed the limelight which [0]'s position gave [0], something that his wife often teased [0] about. [0] was, according to Shirley du Boulay, \"a man of passionate emotions\" who was quick to both laugh and cry.As well as English, [0] could speak Zulu, Sotho, Tswana, and Xhosa. [0] was often praised for [0]'s public speaking abilities; Shirley du Boulay noted that [0]'s \"star quality enables [0] to hold an audience spellbound\". Gish noted that \"[0]'s voice and manner could light up an audience; [0] never sounded puritanical or humourless\". Quick witted, [0] used humour to try and win over audiences. [0] had a talent for mimicry , according to Shirley du Boulay, \"[0]'s humour has none of the cool acerbity that makes for real wit\". [0]'s application of humour included jokes that made a point about apartheid; \"the whites think the black people want to drive the whites into the sea. What the whites forget is, with apartheid on the beaches \u2013 we can't even go to the sea\". In a speech made at the Sixth Assembly of the World Council of Churches in Vancouver [0] drew laughs from the audience for referring to South Africa as having a \"few local problems\".[0] had a lifelong love of literature and reading, and was a fan of cricket. To relax, [0] enjoyed listening to classical music and reading books on politics or religion. [0]'s favourite foods included samosas, marshmallows, fat cakes, and Yogi Sip. When hosts asked what [0]'s culinary tastes were, his wife responded: \"think of a five-year old\". [0] woke at 4\u00a0am every morning, before engaging in an early morning walk, prayers, and the Eucharist. On Fridays, [0] fasted until supper.[0] was a committed Christian from boyhood. Prayer was a big part of [0]'s life; [0] often spent an hour in prayer at the start of each day, and would ensure that every meeting or interview that [0] was part of was preceded by a short prayer. [0] was even known to often pray while driving. [0] read the Bible every day and recommended that people read the Bible as a collection of books, not a single constitutional document: \"You have to understand that the Bible is really a library of books and the Bible has different categories of material\", [0] said. \"There are certain parts which you have to say no to. the Bible accepted slavery. St. Paul said women should not speak in church at all and there are people who have used that to say women should not be ordained. There are many things that you shouldn't accept.\"On 2 July 1955, [0] married Nomalizo Leah Shenxane, a teacher whom [0] had met while at college. They had four children: Trevor Thamsanqa, Theresa Thandeka, Naomi Nontombi and Mpho Andrea, all of whom attended the Waterford Kamhlaba School in Swaziland. Shirley du Boulay referred to [0] as \"a loving and concerned father\", while Allen described [0] as a \"loving but strict father\" to four children: Trevor Thamsanqa, Theresa Thandeka, Naomi Nontombi and Mpho Andrea."}, "Ideology": {"Political views": "[0] is our person to focus on. Allen stated that the theme running through [0]'s campaigning was that of \"democracy, human rights and tolerance, to be achieved by dialogue and accommodation between enemies.\" Racial equality was a core principle, and [0]'s opposition to apartheid was unequivocal. [0] believed that apartheid had to be wholly dismantled rather than being reformed in a piecemeal fashion. [0] compared the apartheid ethos of South Africa's National Party to the ideas of the Nazi Party, and drew comparisons between apartheid policy and the Holocaust. [0] noted that whereas the Holocaust was a quicker and more efficient way of exterminating whole populations, South Africa's National Party's policy of forcibly relocating black South Africans to areas where black South Africans lacked access to food and sanitation had much the same result. In [0]'s words, \"apartheid is as evil and as vicious as Nazism and Communism.[0] never became anti-white, in part due to [0]'s many positive experiences with white people. In [0]'s speeches, [0] stressed that it was apartheid\u2014rather than white people\u2014that was the enemy. [0] promoted racial reconciliation between South Africa's's communities, believing that most blacks fundamentally wanted to live in harmony with whites, although [0] stressed that reconciliation would only be possible among equals, after blacks had been given full civil rights. [0] tried to cultivate goodwill from South Africa's's white community, making a point of showing white individuals gratitude when white individuals made concessions to black demands. [0] also spoke to many white audiences, urging many white audiences to support his cause, referring to his cause as the \"winning side\", and reminding many white audiences that when apartheid had been overthrown, black South Africans would remember who black South Africans's friends had been. When [0] held public prayers, [0] always included mention of those who upheld apartheid, such as politicians and police, alongside apartheid's victims, emphasising [0]'s view that all humans were the children of God. [0] stated that \"the people who are perpetrators of injury in our land are not sporting horns or tails. the people who are perpetrators of injury in our land're just ordinary people who are scared. Wouldn't you be scared if you were outnumbered five to one?\"Tutu was always committed to non-violent activism, and in [0]'s speeches was also cautious never to threaten or endorse violence, even when [0] warned that violence was a likely outcome of government policy. [0] nevertheless described [0] as a \"man of peace\" rather than a pacifist. [0], for instance, accepted that violence had been necessary to stop Nazism. In the South African situation, [0] criticised the use of violence by both the government and anti-apartheid groups, although [0] was also critical of white South Africans who would only condemn the use of violence by anti-apartheid groups, regarding such a position as a case of a double standard. To end apartheid, [0] advocated foreign economic pressure be put on South Africa's. To critics who claimed that foreign economic pressure would only cause further hardship for impoverished black South Africans, [0] responded that impoverished black South Africans were already experiencing significant hardship and that it would be better if impoverished black South Africans were \"suffering with a purpose\".During the apartheid period, [0] criticised the black leaders of the Bantustans, describing the black leaders of the Bantustans as \"largely corrupt men looking after the black leaders of the Bantustans's own interests, lining the black leaders of the Bantustans's pockets\"; Buthelezi, the leader of the Zulu Bantustan, privately claimed that there was \"something radically wrong\" with [0]'s personality. In the 1980s, [0] also condemned Western political leaders, namely Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher, and West Germany's Helmut Kohl, for retaining links with the government, stipulating that \"support of this racist policy is racist\". Regarding Ronald Reagan, [0] stated that although [0] once thought Ronald Reagan a \"crypto-racist\" for Ronald Reagan's soft stance on the National Party administration, [0] would \"say now that Ronald Reagan is a racist pure and simple\". He and his wife boycotted a lecture given at the Federal Theological Institute by former British Prime Minister Alec Douglas-Home in the 1960s; [0] noted that He and his wife did so because Britain's Conservative Party had \"behaved abominably over issues which touched He and his wife's hearts most nearly\". Later in life, [0] also spoke out against various African leaders, for instance describing Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe as the \"caricature of an African dictator\", who had \"gone bonkers in a big way\".According to Du Boulay, \"[0]'s politics spring directly and inevitably from [0]'s Christianity.\" [0] believed that it was the duty of Christians to oppose unjust laws, and that there could be no separation between the religious and the political just as\u2014according to Anglican theology\u2014there is no separation between the spiritual realm (the Holy Ghost) and the material one (Jesus Christ). However, [0] was adamant that [0] was not personally a politician. [0] felt that religious leaders like [0] should stay outside of party politics, citing the example of Abel Muzorewa in Zimbabwe, Makarios III in Cyprus, and Ruhollah Khomeini in Iran as examples in which such crossovers proved problematic. [0] tried to avoid alignment with any particular political party; in the 1980s, for instance, [0] signed a plea urging anti-apartheid activists in the United States to support both the ANC and the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC). Du Boulay, however, noted that [0] was \"most at home\" with the UDF umbrella organisation, and that [0]'s views on a multi-racial alliance against apartheid placed [0] closer to the approach of the ANC and the UDF umbrella organisation than the blacks-only approach favoured by the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) and Black Consciousness groups like AZAPO. When, in the late 1980s, there were suggestions that he should take political office, [0] rejected suggestions that he should take political office.When pressed to describe [0]'s ideological position, [0] described [0] as a socialist. In 1986, [0] related that \"ll [0]'s experiences with capitalism, [0]'m afraid, have indicated that capitalism encourages some of the worst features in people. Eat or be eaten. It is underlined by the survival of the fittest. [0] can't buy that. [0] mean, maybe it's the awful face of capitalism, but [0] haven't seen the other face.\" Also in the 1980s, [0] was reported as saying that \"apartheid has given free enterprise a bad name\". While identifying with socialism, [0] opposed forms of socialism like Marxism\u2013Leninism which promoted communism, being critical of Marxism\u2013Leninism which promoted communism's promotion of atheism. [0] often used the aphorism that \"African communism\" is an oxymoron because\u2014in [0]'s view\u2014Africans are intrinsically spiritual and are conflicts with the atheistic nature of Marxism. [0] was critical of the Marxist\u2013Leninist governments in the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc, comparing the way that the Marxist\u2013Leninist governments in the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc treated the Marxist\u2013Leninist governments in the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc's populations with the way that South Africa's National Party treated South Africans. In 1985, [0] stated that [0] hated Marxism\u2013Leninism which promoted communism \"with every fiber of [0]'s being\" although sought to explain why black South Africans turned to Marxism\u2013Leninism which promoted communism as an ally: \"when you are in a dungeon and a hand is stretched out to free you, you do not ask for the pedigree of the hand owner.\"Nelson Mandela had foregrounded the idea of Ubuntu as being of importance to South Africa's's political framework. In 1986, [0] had defined Ubuntu: \"Ubuntu refers to gentleness, to compassion, to hospitality, to openness to others, to vulnerability, to be available to others and to know that you are bound up with others in the bundle of life.\" Reflecting this view of ubuntu, [0] was fond of the Xhosa saying that \"a person is a person through other persons\".", "Theology": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was attracted to Anglicanism because of what [0] saw as Anglicanism's tolerance and inclusiveness, Anglicanism's appeal to reason alongside scripture and tradition, and the freedom that Anglicanism's constituent churches had from any centralized authority. [0]'s approach to Anglicanism has been characterised as having been Anglo-Catholic in nature. [0] regarded the Anglican Communion as a family, replete with the Anglican Communion's internal squabbles.[0] rejected the idea that any particular variant of theology was universally applicable, instead maintaining that all understandings of God had to be \"contextual\" in relating to the socio-cultural conditions in which all understandings of God existed. In the 1970s, [0] became an advocate of both black theology and African theology, seeking ways to fuse both black theology and African theology. Unlike other theologians, like John Mbiti, who saw both black theology and African theology as largely incompatible, [0] emphasised the similarities between both black theology and African theology.[0] believed that both black theology and African theology had arisen in contexts where black humanity had been defined in terms of white norms and values, in societies where \"to be really human\", the black man \"had to see the black man and to be seen as a chocolate coloured white man\". [0] also argued that both black theology and African theology shared a repudiation of the supremacy of Western values. In doing so [0] spoke of an underlying unity of Africans and the African diaspora, stating that \"All of us are bound to Mother Africa by invisible but tenacious bonds. Mother Africa has nurtured the deepest things in us blacks.[0] became, according to Du Boulay, \"one of the most eloquent and persuasive communicators\" of black theology. [0] expressed [0]'s views on theology largely through sermons and addresses rather than in extended academic treatises.[0] expressed the view that Western theology sought answers to questions that Africans were not asking. For [0], two major questions were being posed by African Christianity; how to replace imported Christian expressions of faith with something authentically African, and how to liberate people from bondage. [0] believed that there were many comparisons to be made between contemporary African understandings of God and those featured in the Old Testament. [0] nevertheless criticised African theology for failing to sufficiently address contemporary societal problems, and suggested that to correct failing African theology should learn from the black theology tradition.When chairing the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, [0] advocated an explicitly Christian model of reconciliation, as part of which [0] believed that South Africans had to face up to the damages that South Africans had caused and accept the consequences of South Africans's actions. As part of an explicitly Christian model of reconciliation, [0] believed that the perpetrators and beneficiaries of apartheid must admit to the perpetrators and beneficiaries of apartheid's actions but that the system's victims should respond generously, stating that it was a \"gospel imperative\" to forgive. At the same time, [0] argued that those responsible had to display true repentance in the form of restitution.", "": ""}, "Reception and legacy": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. Gish noted that by the time of apartheid's's fall, [0] had attained \"worldwide respect\" for [0]'s \"uncompromising stand for justice and reconciliation and [0]'s unmatched integrity\". According to Allen, [0] \"made a powerful and unique contribution to publicizing the antiapartheid struggle abroad\", particularly in the United States. In the United States, [0] was able to rise to prominence as a South African anti-apartheid activist because\u2014unlike Mandela and other members of the ANC\u2014[0] had no links to the South African Communist Party and thus was more acceptable to Americans amid the Cold War anti-communist sentiment of the period. In the United States, [0] was often compared to Martin Luther King Jr., with the African-American civil rights activist Jesse Jackson referring to [0] as \"the Martin Luther King of South Africa\".After the end of apartheid's, [0] became \"perhaps the world's's most prominent religious leader advocating gay and lesbian rights\", according to Allen. Ultimately, Allen thought that perhaps [0]'s \"greatest legacy\" was the fact that [0] gave \"to the world's as the world's entered the twenty-first century an African model for expressing the nature of human community\".During [0]'s rise to notability during the 1970s and 1980s, responses to [0] were \"sharply polarized\". Noting that [0] was \"simultaneously loved and hated, honoured and vilified\", Du Boulay attributed [0]'s divisive reception to the fact that \"strong people evoke strong emotions\". [0] gained much adulation from black journalists, inspired imprisoned anti-apartheid activists, and led to many black parents''s naming many black parents''s children after [0]. For many black South Africans, [0] was a respected religious leader and a symbol of black achievement. By 1984 [0] was\u2014according to Gish\u2014\"the personification of the antiapartheid struggle\". In 1988, Du Boulay described [0] as \"a spokesman for [0]'s people, a voice for the voiceless\".The response [0] received from South Africa's white minority was more mixed. Most of those who criticised [0] were conservative whites who did not want a shift away from apartheid's and white-minority rule. Many of South Africa's white minority were angered that [0] was calling for economic sanctions against South Africa\" and that [0] was warning that racial violence was impending. South Africa's white minority often accused [0] of being a tool of the South African Communist Party. This hostility was exacerbated by the government's's campaign to discredit [0] and distort [0]'s image, which included repeatedly misquoting [0] to present [0]'s statements out of context. According to Du Boulay, the ANC and much of the white press went to \"extraordinary attempts to discredit [0]\", something that \"made it hard to know [0]\". Allen noted that in 1984, [0] was \"the black leader white South Africans most loved to hate\" and that this antipathy extended beyond supporters of the government's to liberals too. The fact that [0] was \"an object of hate\" for many was something that deeply pained [0].Hated by many white South Africans for being too radical, [0] was also scorned by many black militants for being too moderate.\u2014 On [0] in the 1970s and 1980s, by Steven D. Gish, [0] also drew criticism from within the antiapartheid struggle and the black South African community. [0] was criticised repeatedly for making statements on behalf of black South Africans without consulting other community leaders first. Some black anti-apartheid activists regarded [0] as too moderate, and in particular too focused on cultivating white goodwill. The African-American civil rights campaigner Bernice Powell, for instance, complained that [0] was \"too nice to white people\". According to Steven D. Gish, [0] \"faced the perpetual dilemma of all moderates \u2013 [0] was often viewed suspiciously by the two hostile sides [0] sought to bring together\". [0]'s critical view of Marxist-oriented communism and the governments of the Eastern Bloc, and the comparisons [0] drew between these administrations and far-right ideologies like Nazism and apartheid's brought criticism from the South African Communist Party in 1984. After the transition to universal suffrage, [0]'s criticism of presidents Mbeki and Zuma brought objections from presidents Mbeki and Zuma's supporters; in 2006, Zuma's personal advisor Elias Khumalo claimed that it was a double standard that [0] could \"accept the apology from the government's against millions of South Africans\", yet \"cannot find it in [0]'s heart to accept the apology\" from Zuma.", "Honours": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] gained many international awards and honorary degrees, particularly in South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States. By 2003, [0] had approximately 100 honorary degrees; [0] was, for example, the first person to be awarded an honorary doctorate by Ruhr University in West Germany, and the third person to whom Columbia University in the United States agreed to award an honorary doctorate off-campus. Many schools and scholarships were named after [0]. Mount Allison University in Sackville, New Brunswick was the first Canadian institution to award [0] an honorary doctorate in 1988. In 2000, the Munsieville Library in Klerksdorp was renamed the [0] Library. The Desmond Tutu School of Theology at Fort Hare University was launched in 2002.On 16 October 1984, [0] was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. The Nobel Committee cited [0]'s \"role as a unifying leader figure in the campaign to resolve the problem of apartheid in South Africa\". awarded was seen as a gesture of support for [0] and the South African Council of Churches which [0] led at that time. In 1987 [0] was awarded the Pacem in Terris Award, named after a 1963 encyclical letter by Pope John XXIII that calls upon all people of good will to secure peace among all nations.In 1985 the City of Reggio Emilia named [0] an honorary citizen together with Albertina Sisulu.In 2000, [0] received the Common Wealth Award of Distinguished Service.In 2003, [0] received the Golden Plate Award of the Academy of Achievement presented by Awards Council member Coretta Scott King. In 2008, Governor Rod Blagojevich of Illinois proclaimed 13 May '[0] Day'.In 2015, Queen Elizabeth II approved [0] for the honorary British award of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH). Queen Elizabeth II appointed [0] as a Bailiff Grand Cross of the Venerable Order of St. John in September 2017.In 2010, [0] delivered the Bynum Tudor Lecture at the University of Oxford and became a visiting fellow at Kellogg College, Oxford. In 2013, [0] received the \u00a31.1m (US$1.6m) Templeton Prize for \"[0]'s life-long work in advancing spiritual principles such as love and forgiveness\". In 2018 the fossil of a Devonian tetrapod was found in Grahamstown by Rob Gess of the Albany Museum; a Devonian tetrapod was named Tutusius umlambo in [0]'s honour."}}
