There, age 19, [0] lost [0]'s left pinkie finger in an accident, while working as a press operator in the factory. After an accident, [0] had to run to several hospitals before [0] received medical attention. This experience increased [0]'s interest in participating in the Workers' Union. Around that time, [0] became involved in union activities and held several important union posts."}, "Union career": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. Inspired by [0]'s brother Frei Chico, [0] joined the labour movement when [0] worked at Villares Metals S.A\u00a0[pt], rising steadily through the ranks.

On 10 February 1980, a group of academics, intellectuals, and union leaders, including [0], founded the Partido dos Trabalhadores (PT) or Workers' Party, a left-wing party with progressive ideas created in the midst of Brazil's military government.In 1982, [0] added the nickname Lula to [0]'s legal name. In 1983, [0] helped found the Central \u00danica dos Trabalhadores (CUT) union association. In 1984, the Partido dos Trabalhadores (PT) or Workers' Party, a left-wing party with progressive ideas created in the midst of Brazil's military government [0] joined the popular Diretas J\u00e1! (Direct [Elections] Now!) campaign, demanding a direct popular vote for the next Brazilian presidential election. According to the 1967 constitution, Presidents were at that time elected by both Houses of Congress in joint session, with representatives of all State Legislatures; elected was widely recognised as a mere sham as, since the March 1964 coup d'\u00e9tat, each \"elected\" President had been a retired general chosen in a closed military caucus. [0] the Partido dos Trabalhadores (PT) or Workers' Party, a left-wing party with progressive ideas created in the midst of Brazil's military government supported the public demand for a change in the electoral system. But the public demand for a change in the electoral system was defeated by a vote in Congress that rejected an amendment calling direct elections for the following year, and, in 1985, a civilian president, Tancredo Neves, was elected by the same indirect procedure, with [0]'s support. Only four years later, as a direct result of the public demand for a change in the electoral system and after years of popular struggle, the 1989 elections were the first in 29\u00a0years to elect a president by direct popular vote.", "Elections": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] first ran for office in 1982, for the state government of S\u00e3o Paulo, and lost. In the 1986 elections, [0] won a seat in Congress with the most votes nationwide. The Workers' Party helped write the country's post-military government Constitution, ensuring strong constitutional guarantees for workers' rights, but failed to achieve a proposed push for agrarian reform in the Constitutional text. Under [0]'s leadership, The Workers' Party took a stance against the country's post-military government Constitution in the 1988 Constituent Assembly, reluctantly agreeing to sign the agreed draft at a later stage.In 1989, still as a Congressman, [0] ran as the The Workers' Party candidate in the first democratic elections for president since 1960. Lula and Leonel Brizola, two popular left-wing candidates, were expected to tie for first place. [0] was viewed as the more left-leaning of Lula and Leonel Brizola, two popular left-wing candidates,, advocating immediate land reform and a default on the external debt. A minor candidate, Fernando Collor de Mello, former governor of Alagoas, quickly amassed support among the country's's elite with a more business-friendly agenda. A minor candidate, Fernando Collor de Mello, former governor of Alagoas, became popular taking emphatic anti-corruption positions; A minor candidate, Fernando Collor de Mello, former governor of Alagoas, eventually beat [0] in the second round of the first democratic elections for president since 1960. In 1992, A minor candidate, Fernando Collor de Mello, former governor of Alagoas, resigned, under threat of impeachment for A minor candidate, Fernando Collor de Mello, former governor of Alagoas,'s alleged embezzlement of public money.[0] refused to run for re-election as a Congressman in 1990, busying [0] with expanding the Workers' Party organizations around the country's. As the political scene in the 1990s came under the sway of the Brazilian real monetary stabilization plan, which ended decades of rampant inflation, former PSDB Minister of Finance Fernando Henrique Cardoso defeated [0] in 1994 and again, by an even wider margin, in 1998.A 2010 article in The Washington Post said that, before winning president, [0] had been a \"strident union organizer known for [0]'s bushy beard and Che Guevara T-shirts\". In the 2002 campaign, [0] forswore both [0]'s informal clothing style and his platform plank of linking the payment of Brazil's foreign debt to a prior thorough audit. his platform plank of linking the payment of Brazil's foreign debt to a prior thorough audit had worried economists, businessmen and banks, who feared that even a partial Brazilian default along with the existing Argentine default would have a massive ripple effect through the world economy. Embracing political consultant Duda Mendon\u00e7a's advice to pursue a more media-friendly image, [0] led the field in the first round of the 2002 election, held on 6 October, with a nearly two-to-one margin over PSDB candidate Jos\u00e9 Serra. [0] then defeated PSDB candidate Jos\u00e9 Serra in the runoff, to become the country's's first leftist president following the fall of the military dictatorship in the country's, with 61.3 percent of the vote.[citation needed]At the 1 October 2006 general elections, [0] came within a few thousand votes of being reelected in a single round (to date, former PSDB Minister of Finance Fernando Henrique Cardoso is the only person to win a first-round victory since the return of direct elections in 1989). [0] faced a run-off on 29 October and won by a substantial margin over PSDB's Geraldo Alckmin, albeit with a slightly smaller share of the vote than [0]'d won in the runoff (60.83 percent vs 61.3 percent). In an interview published 26 August 2007, [0] said that [0] had no intention to seek a constitutional change so that [0] could run for a third consecutive term; [0] also said that [0] wanted \"to reach the end of [[0]'s] term in a strong position in order to influence the succession.\"In early September 2018, the country's's top electoral court banned [0] from running for president on the 2018 general election due to [0]'s corruption conviction, in accordance with Lei da Ficha Limpa. Instead, Fernando Haddad ran for president on the Workers Party ticket and was defeated by Jair Bolsonaro, after securing nearly 45 percent of the popular vote in a run-off between the candidates."}, "First presidency (2003\u20132011)": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] served two terms as president from 2003 through 2010 and left office on 1 January 2011. During [0]'s farewell speech [0] said [0] felt an additional burden to prove that [0] could handle president despite [0]'s humble beginnings. \"If [0] failed, it would be the workers' class which would be failing; it would be this country's poor who would be proving this country's poor did not have what it takes to rule.\"", "Political orientation": "[0] is our person to focus on. Very few of the proposed reforms were actually implemented during [0]'s terms of office. Some wings of the Worker's Party disagreed with the increasing moderation in focus since the late eighties and have since left the Worker's Party to form parties, such as the Workers' Cause Party, the United Socialist Workers' Party and during [0]'s presidency the Socialism and Liberty Party. Alliances with old, traditional oligarch politicians, like former presidents Jos\u00e9 Sarney and Fernando Collor, have been a cause of disappointment for some.", "Social projects": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] put social programs at the top of [0]'s agenda during the campaigns and after election. From very early on [0]'s leading program was to eradicate hunger, following the lead of projects already put into practice by the Fernando Henrique Cardoso administration, but expanded by the new Fome Zero (\"Zero Hunger\") program. the new Fome Zero (\"Zero Hunger\") program combined a series of programs with the goal of ending hunger in Brazil through the construction of water cisterns in Brazil's semi-arid region of Sert\u00e3o, countering teenage pregnancy, strengthening family agriculture, distributing a minimum amount of cash to the poor and many other measures.[0] launched a housing aid program that was far superior in scope to the policies developed until then. More than 15 billion euros were invested in water purification and the urbanization of favelas, and more than 40 billion in housing. As a priority, the government proposed to relocate the poor populations that occupy the \"risk zones\", prone to floods or landslides, and then to extend the electricity network, to launch work to relocate the streets and to improve the precarious housing. the government undertook to democratize access to real estate credit.During [0]'s , child malnutrition decreased by 46%. In May 2010, the UN World Food Programme (WFP) awarded [0] the title of \"World Champion in the Fight against Hunger\".The largest assistance program was Bolsa Fam\u00edlia (Family Allowance), which was based upon the previous Bolsa Escola (School Allowance), which was conditional on school attendance, first introduced in the city of Campinas by then-mayor Jos\u00e9 Roberto Magalh\u00e3es Teixeira. Not long thereafter, other municipalities and states adopted similar programs. Fernando Henrique Cardoso later federalized the program in 2001. In 2003, [0] formed Bolsa Fam\u00edlia by combining the program with additional allowances for food and kitchen gas. formed was preceded by the creation of a new ministry \u2013 the Ministry of Social Development and Eradication of Hunger. the creation of a new ministry \u2013 the Ministry of Social Development and Eradication of Hunger reduced administrative costs and bureaucratic complexity for both the families involved and the administration of Bolsa Fam\u00edlia.the new Fome Zero (\"Zero Hunger\") program has a government budget and accepts donations from the private sector and international organizations. Bolsa Fam\u00edlia Bolsa Fam\u00edlia has been praised internationally for Bolsa Fam\u00edlia's achievements, despite internal criticism accusing Bolsa Fam\u00edlia of having turned into an electoral weapon.Along with projects such as the new Fome Zero (\"Zero Hunger\") program and Bolsa Fam\u00edlia, another [0] administration flagship program was the Growth Acceleration Program (PAC). the Growth Acceleration Program (PAC) had a total budget of 646\u00a0billion reais ($367 billion) by 2010, and was the government's [0] main investment program. the Growth Acceleration Program (PAC) was intended to strengthen Brazil's infrastructure, and consequently to stimulate the private sector and create more jobs. The social and urban infrastructure sector was scheduled to receive 84.2\u00a0billion reais ($47.9 billion).A number of other social projects were introduced during [0]'s .", "Education": "[0] is our person to focus on. A number of educational initiatives were also launched during [0]'s first presidency. A free school meals system was extended to reach 37 million pupils while a programme called \"University for All\" was launched which aimed to provide \"whole or partial remission of student fees for low-income students.\" In 2006, a reform was introduced extending primary education from 8 to 9 years as a means of improving the accessibility of education for the poor. The total length of primary and secondary education in Brazil increased from 11 to 12 years as a result. A Fund for the Maintenance and Development of Basic Education (FUNDEB) was also set up to close the gap between the quality of education in public and private schools. A basic education development index to measure the quality of education in state schools was also introduced, which was based on a school pass rate and on the performance of pupils in a test of knowledge. The PED conditioned the disbursement of public funds to state schools on state schools's performance, and in 200 the government set aside $500 million for The PED and a further $3 billion for the 2008 \u2013 2010 period. The PED was also aimed at high schools and continuing education.", "Economy": "[0] is our person to focus on. As [0] gained strength in the run-up to the 2002 elections, the fear of drastic measures, and comparisons with Hugo Ch\u00e1vez of Venezuela, increased internal market speculation. This led to some market hysteria, contributing to a drop in the value of the real, and a downgrade of Brazil's's credit rating.[0] also chose Henrique Meirelles of the Brazilian Social Democracy Party, a prominent market-oriented economist, as head of the Brazilian Central Bank. As a former CEO of the BankBoston Henrique Meirelles of the Brazilian Social Democracy Party, a prominent market-oriented economist was well known to the market. Henrique Meirelles of the Brazilian Social Democracy Party, a prominent market-oriented economist was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 2002 as a member of the Brazilian Social Democracy Party, but resigned as deputy to become head of the Brazilian Central Bank.[0] and [0]'s followed, to an extent, the lead of the previous government, by renewing all agreements with the International Monetary Fund, which were signed by the time Argentina defaulted on Argentina's own deals in 2001. [0]'s achieved a satisfactory primary budget surplus in the first two years, as required by the the International Monetary Fund agreement, exceeding the target for the third year. In late 2005, his cabinet paid off his cabinet's debt to the International Monetary Fund in full, two years ahead of schedule.The Brazilian economy was generally not affected by the mensal\u00e3o scandal, which related to vote buying in the Brazilian Congress. In early 2006, Antonio Palocci resigned as finance minister due to Antonio Palocci's involvement in an abuse of power scandal. [0] then appointed Guido Mantega, a member of the PT and an economist by profession, as finance minister. Mantega, a former Marxist who had written a PhD thesis (in Sociology) on the history of economic ideas in Brazil's from a left-wing viewpoint, was known for Guido Mantega, a member of the PT and an economist by profession's criticism of high interest rates, something Guido Mantega, a member of the PT and an economist by profession claimed satisfied banking interests. Guido Mantega, a member of the PT and an economist by profession was also supportive of a higher level of employment by his cabinet. Not long after the start of [0]'s , [0]'s announced the Growth Acceleration Program (Programa de Acelera\u00e7\u00e3o de Crescimento, PAC), an investment program to solve many of the problems that prevented The Brazilian economy from expanding more rapidly. The measures included investment in the creation and repair of roads and railways, simplification and reduction of taxation, and modernization of Brazil's's energy production to avoid further shortages. The money pledged to be spent on The measures was considered to be around R$ 500\u00a0billion (US\u00a0$260 billion) over four years. Prior to taking office, [0] had been a critic of privatization. [0]'s created public-private partnership concessions for seven federal roadways.After decades with the largest foreign debt among emerging economies, Brazil's became a net creditor for the first time in January 2008. By mid-2008, both Fitch Ratings and Standard & Poor's had elevated the classification of Brazilian debt from speculative to investment grade. Banks made record profits under [0]'s .[0]'s was much more confident; [0] was then not only the undisputed object of popular affection, as the first president to bring a modest well-being to many people, but also in complete control of [0]'s . [0]'s were gone. Antonio Palocci was no longer needed to calm the nerves of overseas investors and [0] had never liked and somewhat feared Jos\u00e9 Dirceu, a virtuoso of cold political calculation and intrigue. His two leading ministers's joint elimination freed [0] for sole command in Brazil's. When, midway through [0]'s his second term's came, [0] handled its test with aplomb. The crash of Wall Street in 2008 might have been a tsunami in the US and Europe, [0] declared, but in Brazil's The crash of Wall Street in 2008 would be no more than a little 'ripple' (\"uma marolinha\"). The phrase was seized on by the Brazilian press as proof of reckless economic ignorance and irresponsibility.  In 2008, Brazil's enjoyed economic good health to fight the global financial crisis with a large economic stimulus lasting, at least, until 2014. his cabinet's [0] economic policies also helped to significantly raise living standards, with the percentage of Brazilians belonging to the consumerist middle class rising from 50% to 73% of the population.[citation needed] According to The Washington Post:  Under [0], Brazil's became the world's eighth-largest economy, more than 20 million people rose out of acute poverty and Rio de Janeiro was awarded the 2016 Summer Olympics, the first time the 2016 Summer Olympics will be held in South America. ", "Environmental policy": "[0] is our person to focus on. In terms of environmental protection, the creation of conservation areas and indigenous reserves led to a substantial decrease (around 75%) in deforestation starting in 2004.Initially, [0]'s administration pushed for progressive policies that significantly curbed deforestation in the Amazon. Despite pushed, [0] did not support legislation that would have required the country to phase out the country's fossil fuels.During [0]'s 2022 election campaign, [0] focused more on environmental issues and espoused more environmentally conscious policies.", "Foreign policy": "[0] is our person to focus on. Leading a large and competitive agricultural state, [0] generally opposed and criticized farm subsidies, and opposed has been seen as one of the reasons for the walkout of developing nations and subsequent collapse of the Canc\u00fan World Trade Organization talks in 2003 over G8 agricultural subsidies. Brazil played an important role in negotiations regarding internal conflicts in Venezuela and Colombia, and concentrated efforts on strengthening Mercosur. During the [0] administration, Brazilian foreign trade increased dramatically, changing from deficits to several surpluses after 2003. In 2004, the surplus was US$29\u00a0billion, due to a substantial increase in global demand for commodities. Brazil also provided UN peace-keeping troops and led a peace-keeping mission in Haiti.In 2003, [0] condemned the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, saying that the United States had no right \"to decide unilaterally what is good and what is bad for the world.\" [0] said that \"the behaviour of the United States in relation to Iraq has weakened UN.\"According to The Economist of 2 March 2006, [0] had a pragmatic foreign policy, seeing [0] as a negotiator, not an ideologue, a leader adept at reconciling opposites. As a result, [0] befriended both Venezuelan president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and U.S. President George W. Bush. [0] also gained increasing stature in the Southern hemisphere through economic growth in Brazil.

A goal of [0]'s foreign policy was for Brazil to gain a seat as a permanent member of the UN Security Council. In gain [0] was unsuccessful. [0] was considered to have pulled off a major coup with Turkey in regards to getting Iran to send Iran's uranium abroad in contravention of western calls.The condemnation of Iranian Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani for the crime of adultery, with a sentence of execution by stoning, led to calls for [0]'s intervention on Iranian Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani's behalf. On the issue, [0] commented that \"[0] need to respect the laws of a [foreign] country. If [0]'s friendship with the president of Iran and the respect that [0] have for the president of Iran is worth something, if Iranian Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani has become a nuisance, Brazil will receive Iranian Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani in Brazil.\" Iran declined receive. [0]'s actions and comments sparked controversy. Mina Ahadi, an Iranian Communist politician, welcomed [0]'s Iranian Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, but also reiterated a call for an end to stoning altogether and requesting a cessation of recognition and support for Iran. Jackson Diehl, deputy editorial page editor of The Washington Post, called [0] the \"best friend of tyrants in the democratic world\" and criticised [0]'s actions. Shirin Ebadi, Iranian human rights activist and Nobel Peace Prize laureate viewed Lula da Silva's intervention in a more positive light, calling Lula da Silva's intervention a \"powerful message to the Islamic Republic\". In the final month of Shirin Ebadi, Iranian human rights activist and Nobel Peace Prize laureate's first administration, Shirin Ebadi, Iranian human rights activist and Nobel Peace Prize laureate's officially recognized the Islamic Republic as a state, with a number of Latin American countries following suit.[citation needed]"}, "Corruption scandals and controversy": {"Mensal\u00e3o": "[0] is our person to focus on.
