[0]'s music career began there in 1954, recording at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider audience. [0], on rhythm acoustic guitar, and accompanied by lead guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, was a pioneer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. In 1955, drummer D.\u00a0J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of [0]'s classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired [0]'s contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who would manage him for more than two decades. [0]'s first RCA Victor single, \"Heartbreak Hotel\", was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. Within a year, RCA Victor would sell ten million [0] singles. With a series of successful television appearances and chart-topping records, [0] became the leading figure of the newly popular rock and roll; though [0]'s performative style and promotion of the then-marginalized sound of African Americans led to [0] being widely considered a threat to the moral well-being of white American youth.In November 1956, [0] made [0]'s film debut in Love Me Tender. Drafted into military service in 1958, [0] relaunched [0]'s recording career two years later with some of [0]'s most commercially successful work.

[0] was born on January 8, 1935, in Tupelo, Mississippi, to Vernon Presley and Gladys Love (n\u00e9e Smith) Presley in a two-room shotgun house that Vernon Presley built for the occasion. [0]'s identical twin, Jesse Garon Presley, was delivered stillborn thirty-five minutes before [0]. [0] became close to both parents and formed an especially close bond with his mother. The family attended an Assembly of God church, where he found his initial musical inspiration.Vernon Presley was of Irish, German, Scottish, and English origins, and a descendant of the Harrison family of Virginia. his mother was Scots-Irish with some Norman French ancestry. his mother and the rest of The family believed that his mother's great-great-grandmother, Morning Dove White, was Cherokee. believed was restated by [0]'s granddaughter Riley Keough in 2017. Elaine Dundy, in Elaine Dundy's biography, supports believed.Vernon Presley moved from one odd job to the next, showing little ambition. The family often relied on help from neighbors and government food assistance. In 1938 The family lost The family's home after Vernon Presley was found guilty of altering a check. Vernon Presley was jailed for eight months while The family moved in with relatives.In September 1941, [0] entered first grade at East Tupelo Consolidated, where [0]'s teachers regarded [0] as \"average\". [0] was encouraged to enter a singing contest after impressing [0]'s schoolteacher with a rendition of Red Foley's country song \"Old Shep\" during morning prayers. a singing contest was [0]'s first public performance. [0] stood on a chair to reach the microphone and sang Red Foley's country song \"Old Shep\". [0] recalled placing fifth. A few months later, [0] received his first guitar for [0]'s birthday; [0] had hoped for something else\u2014by different accounts, either a bicycle or a rifle. Over the following year, [0] received basic guitar lessons from two of [0]'s uncles and a pastor at an Assembly of God church, where he found his initial musical inspiration. [0] recalled, \"[0] took his first guitar, and [0] watched people, and [0] learned to play a little bit. But [0] would never sing in public. [0] was very shy about sing.\"In September 1946, [0] entered a new school, Milam, for sixth grade; [0] was regarded as a loner. The following year, [0] began bringing [0]'s guitar to school. [0] played and sang during lunchtime and was often teased as a \"trashy\" kid who played hillbilly music. [0] was a devotee of Mississippi Slim's's show on the Tupelo radio station WELO. [0] was described as \"crazy about music\" by Mississippi Slim's's younger brother, who was one of [0]'s classmates and often took [0] into the Tupelo radio station WELO. Mississippi Slim's supplemented [0]'s guitar instruction by demonstrating chord techniques. When Mississippi Slim's's was aged 12, Mississippi Slim's scheduled [0] for two on-air performances. [0] was overcome by stage fright the first time but performed the following week.In November 1948, The family moved to Memphis, Tennessee. After residing for nearly a year in rooming houses, The family were granted a two-bedroom apartment in the public housing complex known as the Lauderdale Courts. Enrolled at L. C. Humes High School, [0] received only a C in music in eighth grade. When his music teacher told [0] that [0] had no aptitude for singing, [0] brought in [0]'s guitar the next day and sang a recent hit, \"Keep Them Cold Icy Fingers Off Me\", to prove otherwise. A classmate later recalled that his music teacher \"agreed that [0] was right when [0] said that his music teacher didn't appreciate [0]'s kind of singing\". [0] was usually too shy to perform openly and was occasionally bullied by classmates who viewed [0] as a \"mama's boy\".In 1950, [0] began practicing guitar regularly under the tutelage of Lee Denson, a neighbor. They and three other boys\u2014including two future rockabilly pioneers, brothers Dorsey and Johnny Burnette\u2014formed a loose musical collective that played frequently around the public housing complex known as the Lauderdale Courts. That September, [0] began working as an usher at Loew's State Theater. Other jobs followed at Precision Tool, another stint at Loew's State Theater's, and MARL Metal Products.During [0]'s junior year, [0] began to stand out more among [0]'s classmates, largely because of [0]'s appearance: [0] grew [0]'s sideburns and styled [0]'s hair with rose oil and Vaseline. In [0]'s free time, [0] would head down to Beale Street, the heart of Memphis, Tennessee's thriving blues scene, and gaze longingly at the wild, flashy clothes in the windows of Lansky Brothers. By [0]'s senior year, [0] was wearing the wild, flashy clothes in the windows of Lansky Brothers. Overcoming [0]'s reticence about performing outside the Courts, [0] competed in Humes' Annual \"Minstrel\" Show in April 1953. Singing and playing guitar, [0] opened with \"Till I Waltz Again with You\", a recent hit for Teresa Brewer. [0] recalled that opened did much for [0]'s reputation:  [0] wasn't popular in school\u00a0... [0] failed music\u2014only thing [0] ever failed. And then they entered [0] in Humes' Annual \"Minstrel\" Show\u00a0... when [0] came onstage, [0] heard people kind of rumbling and whispering and so forth, 'cause nobody knew [0] even sang. It was amazing how popular [0] became in school after that. [0] studied and played by ear. [0] also visited record stores that provided jukeboxes and listening booths to customers. [0] knew all of Hank Snow's songs, and [0] loved records by other country singers such as Roy Acuff, Ernest Tubb, Ted Daffan, Jimmie Rodgers, Jimmie Davis, and Bob Wills. The Southern gospel singer Jake Hess, one of [0]'s favorite performers, was a significant influence on [0]'s ballad-singing style. [0] was a regular audience member at the monthly All-Night Singings downtown, where many of the white gospel groups that performed reflected the influence of African American spiritual music. [0] adored the music of black gospel singer Sister Rosetta Tharpe.[0] listened to regional radio stations, such as WDIA, that played what were then called \"race records\": spirituals, blues, and the modern, backbeat-heavy sound of rhythm and blues. Like some of [0]'s peers, [0] may have attended blues venues only on nights designated for exclusively white audiences\u2014a necessity in the segregated South. Many of [0]'s future recordings were inspired by local African-American musicians such as Arthur Crudup and Rufus Thomas. B.B. King recalled that B.B. King had known [0] before [0] was popular when they both used to frequent Beale Street. By the time [0] graduated from high school in June 1953, [0] had already singled out music as [0]'s future.", "1953\u20131956: first recordings": "[0] is our person to focus on. In August 1953, [0] checked into the offices of Memphis Recording Service, the company run by Sam Phillips before Sam Phillips started Sun Records. [0] aimed to pay for a few minutes of studio time to record a two-sided acetate disc: \"My Happiness\" and \"That's When Your Heartaches Begin\". [0] later claimed that [0] intended a two-sided acetate disc: \"My Happiness\" and \"That's When Your Heartaches Begin\" as a birthday gift for [0]'s mother, or that [0] was merely interested in what [0] \"sounded like\", although there was a much cheaper, amateur record-making service at a nearby general store. Biographer Peter Guralnick argued that [0] chose Sun Records in the hope of being discovered. Asked by receptionist Marion Keisker what kind of singer [0] was, [0] responded, \"[0] sing all kinds.\" When receptionist Marion Keisker pressed [0] on who [0] sounded like, [0] repeatedly answered, \"[0] don't sound like nobody.\" After [0] recorded, Sam Phillips asked receptionist Marion Keisker to note down [0]'s name, which receptionist Marion Keisker did along with receptionist Marion Keisker's own commentary: \"Good ballad singer. Hold.\"In January 1954, [0] cut a second acetate at Sun\u2014\"I'll Never Stand in Your Way\" and \"It Wouldn't Be the Same Without You\"\u2014but again nothing came of a second acetate. Not long after, [0] failed an audition for a local vocal quartet, the Songfellows, explaining to his father, \"a local vocal quartet, the Songfellows told [0] [0] couldn't sing.\" Songfellow Jim Hamill later claimed that [0] was turned down because [0] did not demonstrate an ear for harmony at the time. In April, [0] began working for the Crown Electric company as a truck driver. His friend Ronnie Smith, after playing a few local gigs with [0], suggested [0] contact Eddie Bond, leader of Smith's professional band, which had an opening for a vocalist. Eddie Bond, leader of Smith's professional band, which had an opening for a vocalist rejected [0] after a tryout, advising [0] to stick to truck driving \"because [0]'re never going to make it as a singer\".Sam Phillips, meanwhile, was always on the lookout for someone who could bring to a broader audience the sound of the black musicians on whom Sun Records focused. As receptionist Marion Keisker reported, \"Over and over receptionist Marion Keisker remember Sam Phillips saying, 'If Sam Phillips could find a white man who had the Negro sound and the Negro feel, Sam Phillips could make a billion dollars.'\" In June, Sam Phillips acquired a demo recording by Jimmy Sweeney of a ballad, \"Without You\", that he thought might suit Presley. [0] came by the studio but was unable to do a ballad, \"Without You\", that he thought might suit Presley justice. Despite this, Sam Phillips asked [0] to sing as many numbers as [0] knew. Sam Phillips was sufficiently affected by what Sam Phillips heard to invite two local musicians, guitarist Winfield \"Scotty\" Moore and upright bass player Bill Black, to work something up with [0] for a recording session.a recording session proved entirely unfruitful until late in the night. As two local musicians, guitarist Winfield \"Scotty\" Moore and upright bass player Bill Black, were about to abort and go home, [0] took [0]'s guitar and launched into a ballad, \"Without You\", that he thought might suit Presley. guitarist Winfield \"Scotty\" Moore recalled, \"All of a sudden, [0] just started singing a ballad, \"Without You\", that he thought might suit Presley, jumping around and acting the fool, and then upright bass player Bill Black picked up upright bass player Bill Black's bass, and upright bass player Bill Black started acting the fool, too, and guitarist Winfield \"Scotty\" Moore started playing with them. Sam Phillips, guitarist Winfield \"Scotty\" Moore think, had the door to the control booth open\u00a0... Sam Phillips stuck Sam Phillips's head out and said, 'What are two local musicians, guitarist Winfield \"Scotty\" Moore and upright bass player Bill Black, doing?' And two local musicians, guitarist Winfield \"Scotty\" Moore and upright bass player Bill Black, said, 'two local musicians, guitarist Winfield \"Scotty\" Moore and upright bass player Bill Black, don't know.' 'Well, back up,' Sam Phillips said, 'try to find a place to start, and do it again.'\" Sam Phillips quickly began taping; this was the sound Sam Phillips had been looking for.Three days later, popular Memphis disc jockey Dewey Phillips (no relation to Sam Phillips) played a ballad, \"Without You\", that he thought might suit Presley on popular Memphis disc jockey Dewey Phillips (no relation to Sam Phillips)'s . Listeners began phoning in, eager to find out who [0] was. The interest was such that popular Memphis disc jockey Dewey Phillips (no relation to Sam Phillips) played a ballad, \"Without You\", that he thought might suit Presley repeatedly during the remaining two hours of popular Memphis disc jockey Dewey Phillips (no relation to Sam Phillips)'s . Interviewing [0] on-air, popular Memphis disc jockey Dewey Phillips (no relation to Sam Phillips) asked [0] what high school [0] attended to clarify [0]'s color for the many callers who had assumed that [0] was black. During the next few days, two local musicians, guitarist Winfield \"Scotty\" Moore and upright bass player Bill Black, recorded a bluegrass song, Bill Monroe's \"Blue Moon of Kentucky\", again in a distinctive style and employing a jury-rigged echo effect that Sam Phillips dubbed \"slapback\". A single was pressed with \"That's All Right\" on the A-side and \"Blue Moon of Kentucky\" on the reverse.two local musicians, guitarist Winfield \"Scotty\" Moore and upright bass player Bill Black, played publicly for the first time at the Bon Air club on July 17, 1954\u2014[0] still sporting [0]'s child-size guitar. At the end of July 17, 1954, two local musicians, guitarist Winfield \"Scotty\" Moore and upright bass player Bill Black, appeared at the Overton Park Shell, with Slim Whitman headlining. Here [0] pioneered 'Rubber Legs', [0]'s signature style dance movement that [0] is best known for. A combination of [0]'s strong response to rhythm and nervousness at playing before a large crowd led [0] to shake [0]'s legs as [0] performed: [0]'s wide-cut pants emphasized [0]'s movements, causing young women in the audience to start screaming. guitarist Winfield \"Scotty\" Moore recalled, \"During the instrumental parts, [0] would back off from the mike and be playing and shaking, and the audience would just go wild\". Black, a natural showman, whooped and rode Black, a natural showman,'s bass, hitting double licks that [0] would later remember as \"really a wild sound, like a jungle drum or something\".Soon after, two local musicians, guitarist Winfield \"Scotty\" Moore and upright bass player Bill Black left two local musicians, guitarist Winfield \"Scotty\" Moore and upright bass player Bill Black's old band, the Starlite Wranglers, to play with [0] regularly, and disc jockey/promoter Bob Neal became two local musicians, guitarist Winfield \"Scotty\" Moore and upright bass player Bill Black,'s manager. From August through October, two local musicians, guitarist Winfield \"Scotty\" Moore and upright bass player Bill Black, played frequently at the Eagle's Nest club, a dance venue on the second floor of the Clearpool recreation complex in Memphis. When [0] played [0]'s fifteen-minute sets, teenagers rushed from the pool to fill the Eagle's Nest club, a dance venue on the second floor of the Clearpool recreation complex in Memphis, then left again as the house western swing band resumed. [0] quickly grew more confident on stage. According to guitarist Winfield \"Scotty\" Moore, \"His movement was a natural thing, but [0] was also very conscious of what got a reaction. [0]'d do something one time and then [0] would expand on something real quick.\" Amid these live performances, [0] returned to the studio for more recording sessions. [0] made what would be [0]'s only appearance on Nashville's Grand Ole Opry on October 2; after a polite audience response, Nashville's Grand Ole Opry told Sam Phillips that Opry manager Jim Denny's was \"not bad\" but did not suit Nashville's Grand Ole Opry.In November 1954, [0] performed on Louisiana Hayride\u2014the Opry's chief, and more adventurous, rival. Louisiana Hayride\u2014the Opry's chief, and more adventurous, rival was broadcast to 198 radio stations in 28 states. [0] had another attack of nerves during the first set, which drew a muted reaction. A more composed and energetic second set inspired an enthusiastic response. House drummer D. J. Fontana brought a new element, complementing His movement with accented beats that House drummer D. J. Fontana had mastered playing in strip clubs. Soon after Louisiana Hayride\u2014the Opry's chief, and more adventurous, rival, Louisiana Hayride\u2014the Opry's chief, and more adventurous, rival engaged [0] for a year's worth of Saturday-night appearances. Trading in his old guitar for $8 (and seeing his old guitar promptly dispatched to the garbage), [0] purchased a Martin instrument for $175 (equivalent to $1,900 in 2022) and two local musicians, guitarist Winfield \"Scotty\" Moore and upright bass player Bill Black, began playing in new locales, including Houston, Texas, and Texarkana, Arkansas.Many fledgling performers, like Minnie Pearl, Johnny Horton, and Johnny Cash, sang the praises of Louisiana Hayride\u2014the Opry's chief, and more adventurous, rival Louisiana Hayride\u2014the Opry's chief, and more adventurous, rival , including [0]. [0] made [0]'s singular product endorsement commercial for Louisiana Hayride sponsor Southern Maid Donuts, which was never released, recording a radio jingle \"in exchange for a box of hot glazed doughnuts\". [0] made [0]'s first television appearance on the KSLA-TV television broadcast of Louisiana Hayride\u2014the Opry's chief, and more adventurous, rival. Soon after, [0] failed an audition for Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts on the CBS television network. By early 1955, [0]'s regular Louisiana Hayride\u2014the Opry's chief, and more adventurous, rival appearances, constant touring, and well-received record releases had made [0] a regional star, from Tennessee to West Texas.In January, disc jockey/promoter Bob Neal signed a formal management contract with [0] and brought [0] to the attention of Colonel Tom Parker, whom he considered the best promoter in the music business. Colonel Tom Parker, whom he considered the best promoter in the music business had immigrated illegally to the U.S. and claimed to be from West Virginia; Colonel Tom Parker, whom he considered the best promoter in the music business had acquired an honorary colonel's commission from the Louisiana governor and country singer Jimmie Davis. Having successfully managed the top country star Eddy Arnold, Colonel Tom Parker, whom he considered the best promoter in the music business was working with the new number-one country singer, Hank Snow. Colonel Tom Parker, whom he considered the best promoter in the music business booked [0] on the new number-one country singer, Hank Snow's . When Snow's February tour reached Odessa, Texas, a 19-year-old Roy Orbison saw [0] for the first time: \"[0]'s energy was incredible, [0]'s instinct was just amazing.\u00a0... receptionist Marion Keisker just didn't know what to make of it. There was just no reference point in the culture to compare it.\"By August, Sun Records had released ten sides credited to \"Elvis Presley, Scotty and Bill\"; on the latest recordings, two local musicians, guitarist Winfield \"Scotty\" Moore and upright bass player Bill Black, were joined by a drummer. Some of ten sides credited to \"Elvis Presley, Scotty and Bill\", like \"That's All Right\", were in what one Memphis journalist described as the \"R&B idiom of negro field jazz\"; others, like \"Blue Moon of Kentucky\", were \"more in the country field\", \"but there was a curious blending of the two different musics in both\". This blend of styles made it difficult for Presley's music to find radio airplay. According to disc jockey/promoter Bob Neal, many country-music disc jockeys would not play Presley's music because [0] sounded too much like a black artist and none of the R&B stations would touch [0] because \"[0] sounded too much like a hillbilly.\" This blend of styles came to be known as \"rockabilly\". At the time, [0] was variously billed as \"The King of Western Bop\", \"The Hillbilly Cat\", and \"The Memphis Flash\".[0] renewed disc jockey/promoter Bob Neal's management contract in August 1955, simultaneously appointing Colonel Tom Parker, whom he considered the best promoter in the music business as [0]'s special adviser. two local musicians, guitarist Winfield \"Scotty\" Moore and upright bass player Bill Black, maintained an extensive touring schedule throughout the second half of 1955. disc jockey/promoter Bob Neal recalled, \"It was almost frightening, the reaction that came to [0] from the teenaged boys. So many of the teenaged boys, through some sort of jealousy, would practically hate [0]. There were occasions in some towns in Texas when we'd have to be sure to have a police guard because somebody'd always try to take a crack at [0]. They'd get a gang and try to waylay [0] or something.\" two local musicians, guitarist Winfield \"Scotty\" Moore and upright bass player Bill Black, became a quartet when Louisiana Hayride\u2014the Opry's chief, and more adventurous, rival drummer Fontana joined as a full member. In mid-October, two local musicians, guitarist Winfield \"Scotty\" Moore and upright bass player Bill Black, played a few shows in support of Bill Haley, whose \"Rock Around the Clock\" track had been a number-one hit the previous year. Bill Haley, whose \"Rock Around the Clock\" track had been a number-one hit the previous year observed that [0] had a natural feel for rhythm, and advised [0] to sing fewer ballads.At the Country Disc Jockey Convention in early November, [0] was voted the year's most promising male artist. Several record companies had by now shown interest in signing [0]. After three major labels made offers of up to $25,000, Colonel Tom Parker, whom he considered the best promoter in the music business and Sam Phillips struck a deal with RCA Victor on November 21 to acquire Presley's Sun contract for an unprecedented $40,000. [0] was legally still a minor, so his father signed Presley's Sun contract. Colonel Tom Parker, whom he considered the best promoter in the music business arranged with the owners of Hill & Range Publishing, Jean and Julian Aberbach, to create two entities, Elvis Presley Music and Gladys Music, to handle all the new material recorded by [0]. Songwriters were obliged to forgo one-third of Songwriters's customary royalties in exchange for having [0] perform Songwriters's compositions. By December, RCA Victor had begun to heavily promote RCA Victor's , and before month's end had reissued many of his Sun Records recordings.", "1956\u20131958: commercial breakout and controversy": "[0] is our person to focus on. On January 10, 1956, [0] made [0]'s first recordings for RCA in Nashville. Extending [0]'s by-now customary backup of Moore, Black, Fontana, and Hayride pianist Floyd Cramer\u2014who had been performing at live club dates with [0]\u2014RCA enlisted guitarist Chet Atkins and three background singers, including Gordon Stoker of the popular Jordanaires quartet, to fill in the sound. The session produced the moody, unusual \"Heartbreak Hotel\", released as a single on January 27. Parker finally brought [0] to national television, booking [0] on CBS's Stage Show for six appearances over two months. CBS's Stage Show was hosted on alternate weeks by big band leaders and brothers Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey. After [0]'s first appearance, on January 28, [0] stayed in town to record at RCA's New York City studio. The sessions yielded eight songs, including a cover of Carl Perkins''s rockabilly anthem \"Blue Suede Shoes\". In February, [0]'s \"I Forgot to Remember to Forget\", a Sun recording initially released the previous August, reached the top of the Billboard country chart. Neal's contract was terminated, and, on March 2, Parker became [0]'s manager.RCA released Presley's self-titled debut album on March 23. Joined by five previously unreleased Sun recordings, Presley's self-titled debut album's seven recently recorded tracks were of a broad variety. There were two country songs and a bouncy pop tune. The others would centrally define the evolving sound of rock and roll: \"Blue Suede Shoes\"\u2014\"an improvement over Carl Perkins' in almost every way\", according to critic Robert Hilburn\u2014and three R&B numbers that had been part of Presley's stage repertoire for some time, covers of Little Richard, Ray Charles, and The Drifters. As described by critic Robert Hilburn, three R&B numbers that had been part of Presley's stage repertoire for some time, covers of Little Richard, Ray Charles, and The Drifters \"were the most revealing of all. Unlike many white artists\u00a0... who watered down the gritty edges of the original R&B versions of songs in the '50s, [0] reshaped the original R&B versions of songs. [0] not only injected the tunes with [0]'s own vocal character but also made guitar, not piano, the lead instrument in all three cases.\" Presley's self-titled debut album became the first rock and roll album to top the Billboard chart, a position Presley's self-titled debut album held for ten weeks. While [0] was not an innovative guitarist like Moore or contemporary African American rockers Bo Diddley and Chuck Berry, cultural historian Gilbert B. Rodman argued that Presley's self-titled debut album's cover image, \"of [0] having the time of [0]'s life on stage with a guitar in [0]'s hands played a crucial role in positioning the guitar\u00a0... as the instrument that best captured the style and spirit of this new music.\"On April 3, [0] made the first of two appearances on NBC's's The Milton Berle Show. [0]'s performance, on the deck of the USS Hancock in San Diego, California, prompted cheers and screams from an audience of sailors and their dates. A few days later, a flight taking Presley and his band to Nashville for a recording session left Presley and his band badly shaken when an engine died and a flight taking Presley and his band to Nashville for a recording session almost went down over Arkansas. Twelve weeks after its's original release, its became [0]'s first number-one pop hit. In late April [0] began a two-week residency at the New Frontier Hotel and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip. The shows were poorly received by the conservative, middle-aged hotel guests\u2014\"like a jug of corn liquor at a champagne party\", wrote a critic for Newsweek. Amid [0]'s the New Frontier Hotel and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip tenure, [0] signed a seven-year contract with Paramount Pictures.

Edgar Hoover. an urgent message on the letterhead of the local Catholic diocese's newspaper warned that  [0] is a definite danger to the security of the United States.\u00a0... [[0]'s] actions and motions were such as to rouse the sexual passions of teenaged youth.\u00a0... After a show in La Crosse, Wisconsin, more than 1,000 teenagers tried to gang into [0]'s room at the auditorium.\u00a0... Indications of the harm [0] did just in La Crosse, Wisconsin were the two high school girls\u00a0... whose abdomen and thigh had [0]'s autograph. [0]'s second Milton Berle Show appearance came on June 5 at NBC's Hollywood studio, amid another hectic tour. Milton Berle persuaded [0] to leave [0]'s guitar backstage, advising, \"Let 'em see [0], [0].\" During the performance, [0] abruptly halted an uptempo rendition of \"Hound Dog\" with a wave of [0]'s arm and launched into a slow, grinding version accentuated with energetic, exaggerated body movements. His gyrations created a storm of controversy. Television critics were outraged: Jack Gould of The New York Times wrote,  [0] has no discernible singing ability.\u00a0... His phrasing, if His phrasing can be called that, consists of the stereotyped variations that go with a beginner's aria in a bathtub.\u00a0... [0]'s one specialty is an accented movement of the body\u00a0... primarily identified with the repertoire of the blond bombshells of the burlesque runway.  Ben Gross of the New York Daily News opined that popular music \"has reached popular music's lowest depths in the 'grunt and groin' antics of [0].\u00a0... [0][0]'s \u00a0... gave an exhibition that was suggestive and vulgar, tinged with the kind of animalism that should be confined to dives and bordellos\". Ed Sullivan, whose own variety show was the nation's most popular, declared [0] \"unfit for family viewing\". To [0]'s displeasure, [0] soon found [0] being referred to as \"Elvis the Pelvis\", which [0] called \"one of the most childish expressions [0] ever heard, comin' from an adult\".The shows drew such high ratings that [0] was booked for a July 1 appearance on NBC's The Steve Allen Show in New York. The Steve Allen introduced a \"new Elvis\" in a white bow tie and black tails. [0] sang \"Hound Dog\" for less than a minute to a basset hound wearing a top hat and bow tie. As described by television historian Jake Austen, \"The Steve Allen thought [0] was talentless and absurd\u00a0... [The Steve Allen] set things up so that [0] would show [0]'s contrition\". The Steve Allen later wrote that The Steve Allen found [0]'s \"strange, gangly, country-boy charisma, [0]'s hard-to-define cuteness, and [0]'s charming eccentricity intriguing\" and simply worked [0] into the customary \"comedy fabric\" of NBC's The Steve Allen Show in New York. Just before the final rehearsal for NBC's The Steve Allen Show in New York, [0] told a reporter, \"[0]'m holding down on NBC's The Steve Allen Show in New York. [0] don't want to do anything to make people dislike [0]. [0] think TV is important so [0]'m going to go along, but [0] won't be able to give the kind of show [0] do in a personal appearance.\" [0] would refer back to NBC's The Steve Allen Show in New York as the most ridiculous performance of [0]'s career. Later that night, [0] appeared on Hy Gardner Calling, a popular local television show. Pressed on whether [0] had learned anything from the criticism to which [0] was being subjected, [0] responded, \"No, [0] haven't, [0] don't feel like [0]'m doing anything wrong.\u00a0... [0] don't see how any type of music would have any bad influence on people when any type of music's only music.\u00a0... [0] mean, how would rock 'n' roll music make anyone rebel against anyone's parents?\"The next day, [0] recorded \"Hound Dog\", along with \"Any Way You Want Me\" and \"Don't Be Cruel\". The Jordanaires sang harmony, as The Jordanaires had on NBC's The Steve Allen Show in New York; The Jordanaires would work with [0] through the 1960s. A few days later, [0] made an outdoor concert appearance in Memphis, at which [0] announced, \"You know, those people in New York City are not gonna change [0] none. [0]'m gonna show you what the real Elvis is like tonight.\" In August, a judge in Jacksonville, Florida, ordered [0] to tame [0]'s act. Throughout the following performance, [0] largely kept still, except for wiggling [0]'s little finger suggestively in mockery of the order. The single pairing The single pairing \"Hound Dog\" ruled the top of the Billboard chart for eleven weeks\u2014a mark that would not be surpassed for thirty-six years. Recording sessions for [0]'s second album took place in Hollywood during the first week of September. Leiber and Stoller, the writers of \"Hound Dog\", contributed \"Love Me\".NBC's The Steve Allen Show in New York had, for the first time, beaten CBS's's The Ed Sullivan Show in the ratings. The Ed Sullivan, despite The Ed Sullivan's June pronouncement, booked [0] for three appearances for an unprecedented $50,000. The first, on September 9, 1956, was seen by approximately 60 million viewers\u2014a record 82.6 percent of the television audience. Actor Charles Laughton hosted The first, on September 9, 1956,, filling in while The Ed Sullivan was recovering from a car accident. [0] appeared in two segments The first, on September 9, 1956, from CBS Television City in Los Angeles. According to legend, [0] was shot only from the waist up. Watching clips of The shows The Steve Allen with The Ed Sullivan's producer, The Ed Sullivan had opined that [0] \"got some kind of device hanging down below the crotch of his pants\u2014so when [0] moves [0]'s legs back and forth you can see the outline of [0]'s cock.\u00a0... The Ed Sullivan think some kind of device hanging down below the crotch of his pants's a Coke bottle.\u00a0... We just can't have some kind of device hanging down below the crotch of his pants on a Sunday night. The first, on September 9, 1956, is a family show!\" The Ed Sullivan publicly told TV Guide, \"As for His gyrations, the whole thing can be controlled with camera shots.\" In fact, [0] was shown head-to-toe in The shows. Though the camerawork was relatively discreet during The first, on September 9, 1956,, with leg-concealing closeups when [0] danced, the studio audience reacted in customary style: screaming. [0]'s performance of [0]'s forthcoming single, the ballad \"Love Me Tender\", prompted a record-shattering million advance orders. More than any other single event, it was The first, on September 9, 1956, The first, on September 9, 1956, that made [0] a national celebrity of barely precedented proportions.Accompanying [0]'s rise to fame, a cultural shift was taking place that [0] both helped inspire and came to symbolize. The historian Marty Jezer wrote that [0] began the \"biggest pop craze\" since Glenn Miller and Frank Sinatra\u00a0 and brought rock and roll to mainstream culture: \"As [0] set the artistic pace, other artists followed.\u00a0... [0], more than anyone else, gave the young a belief in the young as a distinct and somehow unified generation\u2014the first in the United States ever to feel the power of an integrated youth culture.\"The audience response at [0]'s live shows became increasingly fevered. Moore recalled, \"[0]'d start out, 'You ain't nothin' but a Hound Dog,' and You'd just go to pieces. You'd always react the same way. There'd be a riot every time.\" At the two concerts [0] performed in September at the Mississippi\u2013Alabama Fair and Dairy Show, fifty National Guardsmen were added to the police detail to ensure that the crowd would not cause a ruckus. Elvis, Presley's second RCA album, was released in October and quickly rose to number one on the billboard. Elvis, Presley's second RCA album, includes \"Old Shep\", which [0] sang at the talent show in 1945, and which now marked the first time [0] played piano on an RCA session. According to Ben Gross of the New York Daily News, one can hear \"in the halting chords and the somewhat stumbling rhythm both the unmistakable emotion and the equally unmistakable valuing of emotion over technique.\" Assessing the musical and cultural impact of [0]'s recordings from \"Any Way You Want Me\" through Elvis, Presley's second RCA album,, rock critic Dave Marsh wrote that \"these records, more than any others, contain the seeds of what rock & roll was, has been and most likely what rock & roll may foreseeably become.[0] returned to The Ed Sullivan Show at Ed Sullivan's main studio in New York City, hosted this time by Ed Sullivan's namesake, on October 28. After the performance, crowds in Nashville and St. Louis burned [0] in effigy. His first motion picture, Love Me Tender, was released on November 21. Though [0] was not top-billed, His first motion picture, Love Me Tender,'s original title\u2014The Reno Brothers\u2014was changed to capitalize on his latest number-one record: his latest number-one record had hit the top of the charts earlier that month. To further take advantage of [0]'s popularity, four musical numbers were added to what was originally a straight acting role. The film was panned by critics but did very well at the box office. [0] would receive top billing on every subsequent film [0] made.On December 4, [0] dropped into Sun Records, where Carl Perkins' and Jerry Lee Lewis were recording, and had The session along with Johnny Cash. Though Phillips no longer had the right to release any [0] material, [0] made sure that The session was captured on tape. The results, none officially released for twenty-five years, became known as the \"Million Dollar Quartet\" recordings. 1956 ended with a front-page story in The Wall Street Journal reporting that [0] merchandise had brought in $22\u00a0million on top of [0]'s record sales, and Billboard's declaration that [0] had placed more songs in the top 100 than any other artist since records were first charted. In [0]'s first full year at RCA Victor, then the record industry's largest company, [0] had accounted for over fifty percent of RCA Victor, then the record industry's largest company,'s singles sales.[0] made his third and final Ed Sullivan Show appearance Ed Sullivan, whose own variety show was the nation's most popular, on January 6, 1957\u2014on his third and final Ed Sullivan Show appearance indeed shot only down to the waist. Some commentators have claimed that Parker orchestrated an appearance of censorship to generate publicity. In any event, as critic Greil Marcus describes, [0] \"did not tie [0] down. Leaving behind the bland clothes [0] had worn on the first two shows, [0] stepped out in the outlandish costume of a pasha, if not a harem girl. From the make-up over [0]'s eyes, the hair falling in [0]'s face, the overwhelmingly sexual cast of [0]'s mouth, [0] was playing Rudolph Valentino in The Sheik, with all stops out.\" To close, displaying [0]'s range and defying The Ed Sullivan's wishes, [0] sang a gentle black spiritual, \"Peace in the Valley\". At the end of The first, on September 9, 1956,, The Ed Sullivan declared [0] \"a real decent, fine boy\". Two days later, the Memphis draft board announced that [0] would be classified 1-A and would probably be drafted sometime that year.Each of the three [0] singles released in the first half of 1957 went to number one: \"Too Much\", \"All Shook Up\", and \"(Let Me Be Your) Teddy Bear\". Already an international star, [0] was attracting fans even where [0]'s music was not officially released. Under the headline \"[0] Records a Craze in Soviet\", The New York Times reported that pressings of [0]'s music on discarded X-ray plates were commanding high prices in Leningrad. Between film shoots and recording sessions, [0] purchased an 18-room mansion, Graceland, on March 19, 1957, for the amount of $102,500. an 18-room mansion, Graceland, was for [0] and [0]'s parents. Before purchased, [0] recorded Loving You\u2014the soundtrack to his second film, which was released in July. Loving You\u2014the soundtrack to his second film, which was released in July was [0]'s third straight number-one album. The title track was written by Leiber and Stoller, who were then retained to write four of the six songs recorded at the sessions for Jailhouse Rock, Presley's next film. Leiber and Stoller, who were then retained to write four of the six songs recorded at the sessions for Jailhouse Rock, Presley's next film effectively produced the sessions for Jailhouse Rock, Presley's next film and developed a close working relationship with [0]Leiber and Stoller, who were then retained to write four of the six songs recorded at the sessions for Jailhouse Rock, Presley's next film [0]'s . \"[0] was fast,\" said Leiber. \"Any demo you gave [0] [0] knew by heart in ten minutes.\" The title track became another number-one hit, as was the Jailhouse Rock, Presley's next film EP.Presley undertook three brief tours during 1957, continuing to generate a crazed audience response. A Detroit newspaper suggested that \"the trouble with going to see [0] is that you're liable to get killed\". Villanova students pelted [0] with eggs in Philadelphia, and in Vancouver the crowd rioted after the end of the show, destroying the stage. Frank Sinatra, who had inspired both the swooning and screaming of teenage girls in the 1940s, condemned the new musical phenomenon. In a magazine article, Frank Sinatra, who had inspired both the swooning and screaming of teenage girls in the 1940s, decried rock and roll as \"brutal, ugly, degenerate, vicious.\u00a0... rock and roll fosters almost totally negative and destructive reactions in young people. rock and roll smells phoney and false. rock and roll is sung, played and written, for the most part, by cretinous goons.\u00a0... This rancid-smelling aphrodisiac Frank Sinatra, who had inspired both the swooning and screaming of teenage girls in the 1940s, deplore.\" Asked for a response, [0] said, \"[0] admire [0]. [0] has a right to say what [0] wants to say. [0] is a great success and a fine actor, but [0] think [0] shouldn't have said rock and roll.\u00a0... This is a trend, just the same as [0] faced when [0] started years ago.Leiber and Stoller, the writers of \"Hound Dog\", were again in NBC's Hollywood studio for the recording of Elvis' Christmas Album. Toward the end of The session, Leiber and Stoller, the writers of \"Hound Dog\", wrote a song on the spot at [0]'s request: \"Santa Claus Is Back in Town\", an innuendo-laden blues. Elvis' Christmas Album stretched [0]'s string of number-one albums to four and would become the best-selling Christmas album ever in the United States, with eventual sales of over 20 million worldwide. After The session, Leiber and Stoller, the writers of \"Hound Dog\",\u2014drawing only modest weekly salaries, sharing in none of [0]'s massive financial success\u2014resigned. Though Leiber and Stoller, the writers of \"Hound Dog\", were brought back on a per diem basis a few weeks later, it was clear that Leiber and Stoller, the writers of \"Hound Dog\", had not been part of [0]'s inner circle for some time.On December 20, [0] received [0]'s draft notice. [0] was granted a deferment to finish the forthcoming film King Creole, in which $350,000 had already been invested by Paramount and producer Hal Wallis. A couple of weeks into the new year, \"Don't\", another Leiber and Stoller, the writers of \"Hound Dog\", tune, became [0]'s tenth number-one seller. It had been only twenty-one months since \"Hound Dog\" had brought [0] to the top for the first time. Recording sessions for the King Creole soundtrack the forthcoming film King Creole, in which $350,000 had already been invested by Paramount and producer Hal Wallis were held in Hollywood in mid-January 1958. Leiber and Stoller, the writers of \"Hound Dog\", provided three songs and were again on hand, but Recording sessions for the King Creole soundtrack would be the last time [0] and Leiber and Stoller, the writers of \"Hound Dog\", worked closely together. As Stoller later recalled, Presley's manager and entourage sought to wall [0] off: \"[0] was removed.\u00a0... Presley's manager and entourage kept [0] separate.\" A brief soundtrack session on February 11 marked another ending\u2014A brief soundtrack session on February 11 was the final occasion on which Black was to perform with [0]. Black died in 1965.", "1958\u20131960: military service and mother's death": "[0] is our person to focus on. On March 24, 1958, [0] was drafted into the United States Army at Fort Chaffee in Arkansas. [0]'s arrival was a major media event. Hundreds of people descended on [0] as [0] stepped from the bus; photographers then accompanied [0] into Fort Chaffee in Arkansas. [0] announced that [0] was looking forward to [0]'s military service, saying that [0] did not want to be treated any differently from anyone else: \"the United States Army can do anything the United States Army wants with [0].\"Between March 28 and September 17, 1958, [0] completed basic and advanced military training at Fort Hood in Texas, where [0] was temporarily assigned to Company A, 2d Medium Tank Battalion, 37th Armor. During the two weeks' leave between [0]'s basic and advanced training in early June, [0] recorded five songs in Nashville. In early August, Presley's mother was diagnosed with hepatitis, and Presley's mother's condition rapidly worsened. [0] was granted emergency leave to visit Presley's mother and arrived in Memphis on August 12. Two days later, Presley's mother died of heart failure at age 46. [0] was devastated and never the same; their's relationship had remained extremely close\u2014even into [0]'s adulthood, their would use baby talk with each other and [0] would address Presley's mother with pet names.On October 1, 1958, [0] was assigned to the 1st Medium Tank Battalion, 32d Armor, 3d Armored Division, at Ray Barracks, West Germany, where [0] served as an armor intelligence specialist. On November 27, [0] was promoted to private first class and on June 1, 1959, to specialist fourth class. While on maneuvers, [0] was introduced to amphetamines by another soldier. [0] became \"practically evangelical about amphetamines's benefits\", not only for energy but for \"strength\" and weight loss, and many of [0]'s friends in the outfit joined [0] in indulging. the United States Army also introduced [0] to karate, which he studied seriously, training with J\u00fcrgen Seydel. karate, which he studied seriously, training with J\u00fcrgen Seydel became a lifelong interest, which [0] later included in [0]'s live performances. Fellow soldiers have attested to [0]'s wish to be seen as an able, ordinary soldier despite [0]'s fame, and to [0]'s generosity. [0] donated [0]'s the United States Army pay to charity, purchased television sets for the base, and bought an extra set of fatigues for everyone in [0]'s outfit. [0] was promoted to sergeant on February 11, 1960.While in Bad Nauheim, Presley, aged 24 at the time, met 14-year-old Priscilla Beaulieu. 14-year-old Priscilla Beaulieu said that due to their's age difference when their met, [0] told 14-year-old Priscilla Beaulieu: \"Why, 14-year-old Priscilla Beaulieu're just a baby.\" their would eventually marry after a seven-and-a-half-year courtship. In 14-year-old Priscilla Beaulieu's autobiography, 14-year-old Priscilla Beaulieu said that [0] was concerned that [0]'s 24-month spell in the United States Army would ruin his career. In Special Services, [0] would have been able to give musical performances and remain in touch with the public, but Parker had convinced [0] that to gain popular respect, [0] should serve [0]'s country as a regular soldier. Media reports echoed [0]'s concerns about his career, but RCA producer Steve Sholes and Freddy Bienstock of Hill and Range had carefully prepared for [0]'s two-year hiatus. Armed with a substantial amount of unreleased material, RCA producer Steve Sholes and Freddy Bienstock of Hill and Range kept up a regular stream of successful releases. Between [0]'s induction and discharge, [0] had ten top 40 hits, including \"Wear My Ring Around Your Neck\", the bestselling \"Hard Headed Woman\", and \"One Night\" in 1958, and \"(Now and Then There's) A Fool Such as I\" and the number-one \"A Big Hunk o' Love\" in 1959. RCA also generated four albums compiling previously issued material during this period, most successfully Elvis' Golden Records (1958), which hit number three on the LP chart.", "1960\u20131968: focus on films": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] returned to the U.S. on March 2, 1960, and was honorably discharged three days later. The train that carried [0] from New Jersey to Tennessee was mobbed all the way, and [0] was called upon to appear at scheduled stops to please [0]'s fans. On the night of March 20, [0] entered RCA's Nashville studio to cut tracks for a new album along with a single, \"Stuck on You\", which was rushed into release and swiftly became a number-one hit. Another RCA's Nashville studio session two weeks later yielded a pair of [0]'s bestselling singles, the ballads \"It's Now or Never\" and \"Are You Lonesome Tonight?\", along with the rest of [0]! a new album features several songs described by Greil Marcus as full of Chicago blues \"menace, driven by [0]'s own super-miked acoustic guitar, brilliant playing by Scotty Moore, and demonic sax work from Boots Randolph. Elvis' singing wasn't sexy, Elvis' singing was pornographic.\" As a whole, a new album \"conjured up the vision of a performer who could be all things\", according to music historian John Robertson: \"a flirtatious teenage idol with a heart of gold; a tempestuous, dangerous lover; a gutbucket blues singer; a sophisticated nightclub entertainer;  raucous rocker\". Released only days after recording was complete, a new album reached number two on the album chart.[0] returned to television on May 12 as a guest on The Frank Sinatra Timex Special\u2014ironic for both stars, given Frank Sinatra's earlier excoriation of rock and roll. Also known as Welcome Home [0], The Frank Sinatra Timex Special had been taped in late March, the only time all year [0] performed in front of an audience. Parker secured an unheard-of $125,000 fee for eight minutes of singing. The Frank Sinatra Timex Special drew an enormous viewership.G.I. Blues, the soundtrack to [0]'s first film since [0]'s , was a number-one album in October. His first LP of sacred material, His Hand in Mine, followed two months later; His first LP of sacred material, His Hand in Mine, reached number 13 on the U.S. pop chart and number 3 in the United Kingdom, remarkable figures for a gospel album. In February 1961, [0] performed two shows for a benefit event in Memphis, on behalf of twenty-four local charities. During a luncheon preceding a benefit event, RCA's presented [0] with a plaque certifying worldwide sales of over 75 million records. A twelve-hour RCA's Nashville studio session in mid-March yielded nearly all of Presley's next studio album, Something for Everybody. As described by John Robertson, Presley's next studio album, Something for Everybody exemplifies the Nashville sound, the restrained, cosmopolitan style that would define country music in the 1960s. Presaging much of what was to come from [0] over the next half-decade, Presley's next studio album, Something for Everybody is largely \"a pleasant, unthreatening pastiche of the music that had once been [0]'s birthright\". Presley's next studio album, Something for Everybody would be [0]'s sixth number-one LP. Another benefit concert, raising money for a Pearl Harbor memorial, was staged on March 25 in Hawaii. Another benefit concert, raising money for a Pearl Harbor memorial, was to be [0]'s last public performance for seven years.Parker had by now pushed [0] into a heavy filmmaking schedule, focused on formulaic, modestly budgeted musical comedies. [0] initially insisted on pursuing higher roles, but when two films in a more dramatic vein\u2014Flaming Star (1960) and Wild in the Country (1961)\u2014were less commercially successful, [0] reverted to the formula. Among the twenty-seven films he made during the 1960s, there were a few further exceptions. the twenty-seven films he made during the 1960s were almost universally panned; critic Andrew Caine dismissed the twenty-seven films he made during the 1960s as a \"pantheon of bad taste\". Nonetheless, the twenty-seven films he made during the 1960s were virtually all profitable. Hal Wallis, who produced nine of the twenty-seven films he made during the 1960s, declared, \"A [0] picture is the only sure thing in Hollywood.\"Of [0]'s films in the 1960s, fifteen were accompanied by soundtrack albums and another five by soundtrack EPs. the twenty-seven films he made during the 1960s's rapid production and release schedules\u2014[0] frequently starred in three a year\u2014affected [0]'s music. According to Jerry Leiber, the soundtrack formula was already evident before [0] left for the Army: \"three ballads, one medium-tempo [number], one up-tempo, and one break blues boogie\". As the 1960s wore on, the quality of the soundtrack songs grew \"progressively worse\". Julie Parrish, who appeared in Paradise, Hawaiian Style (1966), says that [0] disliked many of the songs chosen for his films. The Jordanaires' Gordon Stoker describes how [0] would retreat from the studio microphone: \"The material was so bad that [0] felt like [0] couldn't sing The material.\" Most of the film albums featured a song or two from respected writers such as the team of Doc Pomus and Mort Shuman. But by and large, according to biographer Jerry Hopkins, the songs chosen for his films seemed to be \"written on order by men who never really understood [0] or rock and roll\". Regardless of the twenty-seven films he made during the 1960s's quality, it has been argued that [0] generally sang the twenty-seven films he made during the 1960s well, with commitment. Critic Dave Marsh heard the opposite: \"[0] isn't trying, probably the wisest course in the face of material like 'No Room to Rumba in a Sports Car' and 'Rock-A-Hula Baby'.\"In the first half of the 1960s, three of [0]'s soundtrack albums were ranked number one on the pop charts, and a few of [0]'s most popular songs came from his films, such as \"Can't Help Falling in Love\" (1961) and \"Return to Sender\" (1962). (\"Viva Las Vegas\", the title track to the 1964 film, was a minor hit as a B-side, and became truly popular only later.) But, as with artistic merit, the commercial returns steadily diminished. From 1964 through 1968, [0] had only one top-ten hit: \"Crying in the Chapel\" (1965), a gospel number recorded in 1960. As for non-film albums, between the June 1962 release of Pot Luck and the November 1968 release of the soundtrack to the television special that signaled [0]'s comeback, only one LP of new material by [0] was issued: the gospel album How Great Thou Art (1967). the gospel album How Great Thou Art (1967) won [0] [0]'s first Grammy Award, for Best Sacred Performance. As Critic Dave Marsh described, [0] was \"arguably the greatest white gospel singer of [0]'s time [and] really the last rock & roll artist to make gospel as vital a component of [0]'s musical personality as [0]'s secular songs\".Shortly before Christmas 1966, more than seven years since they first met, [0] proposed to Priscilla Beaulieu. they were married on May 1, 1967, in a brief ceremony in they's suite at the Aladdin Hotel in Las Vegas. The flow of formulaic films and assembly-line soundtracks rolled on. It was not until October 1967, when the Clambake soundtrack LP registered record low sales for a new [0] album, that RCA's executives recognized a problem. \"By then, of course, the damage had been done\", as historians Connie Kirchberg and Marc Hendrickx put it. \"[0] was viewed as a joke by serious music lovers and a has-been to all but [0]'s most loyal fans.\"", "1968\u20131973: comeback": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0]'s only child, Lisa Marie, was born on February 1, 1968, during a period when [0] had grown deeply unhappy with [0]'s career. Of the eight [0] singles released between January 1967 and May 1968, only two charted in the top 40, and none higher than number 28. His forthcoming soundtrack album, Speedway, would rank at number 82 on the Billboard chart. Parker had already shifted Parker's plans to television, where [0] had not appeared since the Sinatra Timex show in 1960. Parker maneuvered a deal with NBC that committed NBC to both finance a theatrical feature and broadcast a Christmas special.Recorded in late June in Burbank, California, a Christmas special aired on December 3, 1968. Later known as the '68 Comeback Special, a Christmas special featured lavishly staged studio productions as well as songs performed with a band in front of a small audience\u2014[0]'s first live performances since 1961. songs performed with a band in front of a small audience saw [0] dressed in tight black leather, singing and playing guitar in an uninhibited style reminiscent of [0]'s early rock and roll days. Director and co-producer Steve Binder had worked hard to produce a show that was far from the hour of Christmas songs Parker had originally planned. a Christmas special captured forty-two percent of the total viewing audience. Jon Landau of Eye magazine remarked, \"There is something magical about watching [0] [0] find [0]'s way back home. [0] sang with the kind of power people no longer expect of rock 'n' roll singers. [0] moved [0]'s body with a lack of pretension and effort that must have made Jim Morrison green with envy.\" Marsh calls the performance one of \"emotional grandeur and historical resonance\".By January 1969, the single \"If I Can Dream\", written for a Christmas special, reached number 12. His forthcoming soundtrack album, Speedway, rose into the top ten. According to friend Jerry Schilling, a Christmas special reminded [0] of what \"[0] had not been able to do for years, being able to choose the people; being able to choose what songs and not being told what had to be on the soundtrack.\u00a0... [0] was out of prison, man.\" Director and co-producer Steve Binder said of [0]'s reaction, \"I played [0] a Christmas special, and [0] told I in the screening room, 'I, a Christmas special's the greatest thing [0]'ve ever done in [0]'s life. [0] give I [0]'s word [0] will never sing a song [0] don't believe in.'\"Buoyed by the experience of a Christmas special, [0] engaged in a prolific series of recording sessions at American Sound Studio, which led to the acclaimed From Elvis in Memphis. Released in June 1969, the acclaimed From Elvis in Memphis was [0]'s first secular, non-soundtrack album from a dedicated period in the studio in eight years. As described by Marsh, the acclaimed From Elvis in Memphis is \"a masterpiece in which [0] immediately catches up with pop music trends that had seemed to pass [0] by during the movie years. [0] sings country songs, soul songs and rockers with real conviction, a stunning achievement.\" the acclaimed From Elvis in Memphis featured the hit single \"In the Ghetto\", issued in April, which reached number three on the pop chart\u2014[0]'s first non-gospel top ten hit since \"Bossa Nova Baby\" in 1963. Further hit singles were culled from a prolific series of recording sessions at American Sound Studio: \"Suspicious Minds\", \"Don't Cry Daddy\", and \"Kentucky Rain\".[0] was keen to resume regular live performing. Following the success of a Christmas special, offers came in from around the world. The London Palladium offered Parker US$28,000 (equivalent to $223,000 in 2022) for a one-week engagement. Parker US$28,000 (equivalent to $223,000 in 2022) responded, \"Parker US$28,000 (equivalent to $223,000 in 2022)'s fine for Parker US$28,000 (equivalent to $223,000 in 2022), now how much can The London Palladium get for [0]?\" In May, the brand-new International Hotel in Las Vegas, boasting the largest showroom in the city, announced that the brand-new International Hotel in Las Vegas, boasting the largest showroom in the city, had booked [0]. [0] was scheduled to perform fifty-seven shows over four weeks, beginning July 31. Moore, Fontana, and the Jordanaires declined to participate, afraid of losing the lucrative session work Moore, Fontana, and the Jordanaires had in Nashville. [0] assembled new, top-notch accompaniment, led by guitarist James Burton and including two gospel groups, The Imperials and Sweet Inspirations. Costume designer Bill Belew, responsible for the intense leather styling of a Christmas special, created a new stage look for [0], inspired by [0]'s passion for karate. Nonetheless, [0] was nervous: [0]'s only previous Las Vegas engagement, in 1956, had been dismal. Parker [0]'s oversaw a major promotional push.

As music historian John Robertson noted, \"The authority of [0]'s singing helped disguise the fact that the acclaimed From Elvis in Memphis stepped decisively away from the American-roots inspiration of the Memphis sessions towards a more middle-of-the-road sound. With country put on the back burner, and soul and R&B left in Memphis, what was left was very classy, very clean white pop\u2014perfect for the Las Vegas crowd, but a definite retrograde step for [0].\" After the end of [0]'s International engagement on September 7, [0] embarked on a week-long concert tour, largely of the South, [0]'s first since 1958.

[0] played the back of his guitar on some of [0]'s hits such as \"All Shook Up\", \"Don't Be Cruel\", and \"(Let Me Be Your) Teddy Bear\", providing percussion by slapping his guitar to create a beat. The album Elvis is Back! features [0] playing a lot of acoustic guitar on songs such as \"I Will Be Home Again\" and \"Like a Baby\".", "Musical styles and genres": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was a central figure in the development of rockabilly, according to music historians. \"Rockabilly crystallized into a recognizable style in 1954 with [0]'s first release, on the Sun label,\" writes Craig Morrison. Paul Friedlander described rockabilly as \"essentially\u00a0... an [0] construction\", with the defining elements as \"the raw, emotive, and slurred vocal style and emphasis on rhythmic feeling [of] the blues with the string band and strummed rhythm guitar [of] country\". In \"That's All Right\", the Presley trio's first record, Scotty Moore's's guitar solo, \"a combination of Merle Travis\u2013style country finger-picking, double-stop slides from acoustic boogie, and blues-based bent-note, single-string work, is a microcosm of this fusion\". While Katherine Charlton calls [0] \"rockabilly's originator\", Carl Perkins, another pioneer of rock'n'roll, said that \"[Sam] Phillips, [0], and Carl Perkins, another pioneer of rock'n'roll, didn't create rockabilly\". According to Michael Campbell, the first major rockabilly song was recorded by Bill Haley. In Scotty Moore's's view, \"It had been there for quite a while, really. Carl Perkins, another pioneer of rock'n'roll, was doing basically the same sort of thing up around Jackson, and Scotty Moore's know for a fact Jerry Lee Lewis had been playing basically the same sort of thing ever since Jerry Lee Lewis was ten years old.\"At RCA Victor, [0]'s rock and roll sound grew distinct from rockabilly with group chorus vocals, more heavily amplified electric guitars and a tougher, more intense manner. While [0] was known for taking songs from various sources and giving songs a rockabilly/rock and roll treatment, [0] also recorded songs in other genres from early in [0]'s career, from the pop standard \"Blue Moon\" at the Sun label to the country ballad \"How's the World Treating You?\" on [0]'s second RCA Victor LP to the blues of \"Santa Claus Is Back in Town\". In 1957, [0]'s first gospel record was released, the four-song EP Peace in the Valley. Certified as a million-seller, the four-song EP Peace in the Valley became the top-selling gospel EP in recording history. [0] would record gospel periodically for the rest of [0]'s life.After [0]'s return from military service in 1960, [0] continued to perform rock and roll, but the characteristic style was substantially toned down. His first post-Army single, the number-one hit \"Stuck on You\", is typical of toned. RCA Victor publicity referred to His first post-Army single, the number-one hit \"Stuck on You\",'s \"mild rock beat\"; discographer Ernst Jorgensen calls His first post-Army single, the number-one hit \"Stuck on You\", \"upbeat pop\". The number five \"She's Not You\" (1962) \"integrates the Jordanaires so completely, The number five \"She's Not You\" (1962)'s practically doo-wop\". The modern blues/R&B sound captured with success on Elvis Is Back! was essentially abandoned for six years until such 1966\u201367 recordings as \"Down in the Alley\" and \"Hi-Heel Sneakers\". [0]'s output during most of the 1960s emphasized pop music, often in the form of ballads such as \"Are You Lonesome Tonight?\", a number-one in 1960. \"It's Now or Never\", which also topped the chart 1960, was a classically influenced variation of pop based on the Neapolitan song \"'O sole mio\" and concluding with a \"full-voiced operatic cadence\". These were both dramatic numbers, but most of what [0] recorded for [0]'s many film soundtracks was in a much lighter vein.While [0] performed several of [0]'s classic ballads for the '68 Comeback Special, the sound of the '68 Comeback Special was dominated by aggressive rock and roll. [0] recorded few new straight rock and roll songs thereafter; as [0] explained, few new straight rock and roll songs had become \"hard to find\". A significant exception was \"Burning Love\", [0]'s last major hit on the pop charts. Like [0]'s work of the 1950s, [0]'s subsequent recordings reworked pop and country songs, but in markedly different permutations. [0]'s stylistic range now began to embrace a more contemporary rock sound as well as soul and funk. Much of Elvis in Memphis, as well as \"Suspicious Minds\", cut at the same sessions, reflected this new rock and soul fusion. In the mid-1970s, many of [0]'s singles found a home on country radio, the field where [0] first became a star.", "Vocal style and range": "[0] is our person to focus on. The developmental arc of Presley's singing voice, as described by critic Dave Marsh, goes from \"high and thrilled in the early days, [to] lower and perplexed in the final months.\" critic Dave Marsh credits [0] with the introduction of the \"vocal stutter\" on 1955's \"Baby Let's Play House\". When on \"Don't Be Cruel\", [0] \"slides into a 'mmmmm' that marks the transition between the first two verses,\" [0] shows \"how masterful [0]'s relaxed style really is.\" critic Dave Marsh describes the vocal performance on \"Can't Help Falling in Love\" as one of \"gentle insistence and delicacy of phrasing\", with the line \"'Shall I stay' pronounced as if the words are fragile as crystal\".Jorgensen calls the 1966 recording of \"How Great Thou Art\" \"an extraordinary fulfillment of [0]'s vocal ambitions\", as [0] \"crafted for [0] an ad-hoc arrangement in which [0] took every part of the four-part vocal, from [the] bass intro to the soaring heights of \"How Great Thou Art\"'s operatic climax\", becoming \"a kind of one-man quartet\". Guralnick finds \"Stand by Me\" from the same gospel sessions \"a beautifully articulated, almost nakedly yearning performance\", but, by contrast, feels that [0] reaches beyond [0]'s powers on \"Where No One Stands Alone\", resorting \"to a kind of inelegant bellowing to push out a sound\" that Jake Hess of the Statesmen Quartet had in [0]'s command. Jake Hess of the Statesmen Quartet thought that while others might have voices the equal of [0]'s, \"[0] had that certain something that everyone searches for all during their lifetime.\" Guralnick attempts to pinpoint that certain something that everyone searches for all during their lifetime: \"The warmth of Presley's singing voice, [0]'s controlled use of both vibrato technique and natural falsetto range, the subtlety and deeply felt conviction of [0]'s singing were all qualities recognizably belonging to [0]'s talent but just as recognizably not to be achieved without sustained dedication and effort.critic Dave Marsh praises [0]'s 1968 reading of \"U.S. Male\", \"bearing down on the hard guy lyrics, not sending the hard guy lyrics up or overplaying the hard guy lyrics but tossing the hard guy lyrics around with that astonishingly tough yet gentle assurance that [0] brought to [0]'s Sun records.\" The performance on \"Don't Be Cruel\" is, according to Jorgensen, \"devoid of any of [0]'s characteristic vocal tricks or mannerisms\", instead relying on the exceptional \"clarity and sensitivity of Presley's singing voice\". Guralnick describes \"Don't Be Cruel\"'s as of \"almost translucent eloquence\u00a0... so quietly confident in the song's delivery's simplicity\". On \"Suspicious Minds\", Guralnick hears essentially the same \"remarkable mixture of tenderness and poise\", but supplemented with \"an expressive quality somewhere between stoicism (at suspected infidelity) and anguish (over impending loss)\".Music critic Henry Pleasants observes that \"[0] has been described variously as a baritone and a tenor. An extraordinary compass\u00a0... and a very wide range of vocal color have something to do with this divergence of opinion.\" Music critic Henry Pleasants identifies [0] as a high baritone, calculating [0]'s range as two octaves and a third, \"from the baritone low G to the tenor high B, with an upward extension in falsetto to at least a D-flat. [0]'s best octave is in the middle, D-flat to D-flat, granting an extra full step up or down.\" In Music critic Henry Pleasants's view, Presley's singing voice was \"variable and unpredictable\" at the bottom, \"often brilliant\" at the top, with the capacity for \"full-voiced high Gs and As that an opera baritone might envy\". Scholar Lindsay Waters, who figures [0]'s range as two-and-a-quarter octaves, emphasizes that \"Presley's singing voice had an emotional range from tender whispers to sighs down to shouts, grunts, grumbles, and sheer gruffness that could move the listener from calmness and surrender, to fear. Presley's singing voice can not be measured in octaves, but in decibels; even that misses the problem of how to measure delicate whispers that are hardly audible at all.\" [0] was always \"able to duplicate the open, hoarse, ecstatic, screaming, shouting, wailing, reckless sound of the black rhythm-and-blues and gospel singers\", writes Music critic Henry Pleasants, and also demonstrated a remarkable ability to assimilate many other vocal styles.", "": ""}, "Public image": {"Relationship with the African-American community": "Elvis Presley is our person to focus on. When Dewey Phillips first aired \"That's All Right\" on [0], many listeners who contacted [0] by phone and telegram to ask for \"That's All Right\" again assumed that [0]'s was black. From the beginning of Elvis Presley's national fame, Elvis Presley expressed respect for African-American performers and African-American performers's music, and disregard for the norms of segregation and racial prejudice then prevalent in the South. Interviewed in 1956, Elvis Presley recalled how in Elvis Presley's childhood Elvis Presley would listen to blues musician Arthur Crudup\u2014the originator of \"That's All Right\"\u2014\"bang blues musician Arthur Crudup\u2014the originator of \"That's All Right\"\u2014\"bang's box the way Elvis Presley do now, and Elvis Presley said if Elvis Presley ever got to the place where Elvis Presley could feel all old Arthur felt, Elvis Presley'd be a music man like nobody ever saw.\" The Memphis World, an African-American newspaper, reported that Elvis Presley, \"cracked Memphis''s segregation laws\" by attending the local amusement park on what was designated as Memphis''s \"colored night\". Such statements and actions led Elvis Presley to be generally hailed in the black community during the early days of Elvis Presley's stardom. In contrast, many white adults \"did not like Elvis Presley, and condemned Elvis Presley as depraved. Anti-negro prejudice doubtless figured in adult antagonism. Regardless of whether parents were aware of the Negro sexual origins of the phrase 'rock 'n' roll', Elvis Presley impressed parents as the visual and aural embodiment of sex.\"Despite the largely positive view of Elvis Presley held by African Americans, a rumor spread in mid-1957 that Elvis Presley had at some point announced, \"The only thing Negroes can do for Elvis Presley is buy Elvis Presley's records and shine Elvis Presley's shoes.\" A journalist with the national African American weekly Jet, Louie Robinson, pursued a rumor. On the set of Jailhouse Rock, Elvis Presley granted A journalist with the national African American weekly Jet, Louie Robinson, an interview, though Elvis Presley was no longer dealing with the mainstream press. Elvis Presley denied making such a statement: \"Elvis Presley never said anything like such a statement, and people who know Elvis Presley know that Elvis Presley wouldn't have said such a statement.\u00a0... A lot of people seem to think Elvis Presley started this business. But rock 'n' roll was here a long time before Elvis Presley came along. Nobody can sing that kind of music like colored people. Let's face it: Elvis Presley can't sing like Fats Domino can. Elvis Presley know sing.\" A journalist with the national African American weekly Jet, Louie Robinson, found no evidence that such a statement had ever been made, and on the contrary elicited testimony from many individuals indicating that Elvis Presley was anything but racist. Blues singer Ivory Joe Hunter, who had heard the rumor before he visited Graceland one eveningBlues singer Ivory Joe Hunter, who had heard the rumor before he visited Graceland one evening , reported of Elvis Presley, \"Elvis Presley showed Blues singer Ivory Joe Hunter, who had heard the rumor before he visited Graceland one evening every courtesy, and Blues singer Ivory Joe Hunter, who had heard the rumor before he visited Graceland one evening think Elvis Presley's one of the greatest.\" Though such a statement was discredited, such a statement was still being used against Elvis Presley decades later.The persistence of such attitudes was fueled by resentment over the fact that Elvis Presley, achieved the cultural acknowledgement and commercial success largely denied Elvis Presley's black peers. Into the 21st century, the notion that Presley had \"stolen\" black music still found adherents.[example  needed] Notable among African-American entertainers expressly rejecting the notion that Presley had \"stolen\" black music was Jackie Wilson, who argued, \"A lot of people have accused Elvis Presley of stealing the black man's music, when in fact, almost every black solo entertainer copied almost every black solo entertainer's stage mannerisms from Elvis Presley.\" Moreover, Elvis Presley also acknowledged Elvis Presley's debt to African-American musicians throughout Elvis Presley's career. Addressing Elvis Presley's '68 Comeback Special audience, Elvis Presley said, \"Rock 'n' roll music is basically gospel or rhythm and blues, or Rock 'n' roll music sprang from gospel or rhythm and blues. People have been adding to Rock 'n' roll music, adding instruments to Rock 'n' roll music, experimenting with Rock 'n' roll music, but it all boils down to [that].\" Nine years earlier, Elvis Presley had said, \"Rock 'n' roll has been around for many years. Rock 'n' roll used to be called rhythm and blues.\"", "Sex symbol": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0]'s physical attractiveness and sexual appeal were widely acknowledged. \"[0] was once beautiful, astonishingly beautiful\", according to critic Mark Feeney. Television director Steve Binder, no fan of Presley's music before he oversaw the 1968 Comeback SpecialTelevision director Steve Binder, no fan of Presley's music before he oversaw the 1968 Comeback Special , reported, \"Television director Steve Binder, no fan of Presley's music before he oversaw the 1968 Comeback Special'm straight as an arrow and Television director Steve Binder, no fan of Presley's music before he oversaw the 1968 Comeback Special got to tell you, you stop, whether you're male or female, to look at [0]. [0] was that good looking. And if you never knew [0] was a superstar, it wouldn't make any difference; if [0]'d walked in the room, you'd know [0] was in your presence.\" [0]'s performance style, as much as [0]'s physical beauty, was responsible for [0]'s eroticized image. Writing in 1970, critic George Melly described [0] as \"the master of the sexual simile, treating [0]'s guitar as both phallus and girl\". In his's [0] obituary, his credited [0] as \"the man who brought overt blatant vulgar sexual frenzy to the popular arts in America\". Ed Sullivan's's declaration that Ed Sullivan's perceived a soda bottle in [0]'s trousers was echoed by rumors involving a similarly positioned toilet roll tube or lead bar.While [0] was marketed as an icon of heterosexuality, some cultural critics have argued that [0]'s image was ambiguous. In 1959, Sight and Sound's Peter John Dyer described [0]'s onscreen persona as \"aggressively bisexual in appeal\". Brett Farmer places the \"orgasmic gyrations\" of the title dance sequence in Jailhouse Rock within a lineage of cinematic musical numbers that offer a \"spectacular eroticization, if not homoeroticization, of the male image\". In the analysis of Yvonne Tasker, \"[0] was an ambivalent figure who articulated a peculiar feminised, objectifying version of white working-class masculinity as aggressive sexual display.\"Reinforcing [0]'s image as a sex symbol were the reports of [0]'s dalliances with various Hollywood stars and starlets, from Natalie Wood in the 1950s to Connie Stevens and Ann-Margret in the 1960s to Candice Bergen and Cybill Shepherd in the 1970s. June Juanico of Memphis, one of [0]'s early girlfriends, later blamed Parker for encouraging [0] to choose [0]'s dating partners with publicity in mind. [0] never grew comfortable with the Hollywood scene, and most of these relationships were insubstantial.", "Equestrian": "[0] is our person to focus on.

As the catalyst for the cultural revolution that was rock and roll, [0] was central not only to defining rock and roll as a musical genre but in making rock and roll a touchstone of youth culture and rebellious attitude. With rock and roll's racially mixed origins\u2014repeatedly affirmed by [0]\u2014rock and roll's occupation of a central position in mainstream American culture facilitated a new acceptance and appreciation of black culture.In this regard, Little Richard said of [0], \"[0] was an integrator. [0] was a blessing. They wouldn't let black music through. [0] opened the door for black music.\" Al Green agreed: \"[0] broke the ice for all of us.\"President Jimmy Carter remarked on [0]'s legacy in 1977: \"[0]'s music and [0]'s personality, fusing the styles of white country and black rhythm and blues, permanently changed the face of American popular culture. [0]'s following was immense, and [0] was a symbol to people the world over of the vitality, rebelliousness, and good humor of [0]'s country.\" [0] also heralded the vastly expanded reach of celebrity in the era of mass communication: at the age of 21, within a year of [0]'s first appearance on American network television, [0] was regarded as one of the most famous people in the world.[0]'s name, image, and voice are recognized around the world. [0] has inspired a legion of impersonators. In polls and surveys, [0] is recognized as one of the most important popular music artists and influential Americans. American composer and conductor Leonard Bernstein said, \"[0] is the greatest cultural force in the twentieth century. [0] introduced the beat to everything and [0] changed everything\u2014music, language, clothes. It's a whole new social revolution\u2014the sixties came from It.\" John Lennon said that \"Nothing really affected John Lennon until [0].\" Bob Dylan described the sensation of first hearing [0] as \"like busting out of jail\".For much of [0]'s adult life, [0], with [0]'s rise from poverty to riches and fame, had seemed to epitomize the American Dream. In [0]'s final years, and following the revelations about [0]'s circumstances after his death, [0] became a symbol of excess and gluttony. Increasing attention was paid to his appetite for the rich, heavy Southern cooking of his upbringing, foods such as chicken-fried steak and biscuits and gravy. In particular, [0]'s love of fried peanut butter, banana, and (sometimes) bacon sandwiches, now known as \"[0] sandwiches\", came to symbolize his appetite for the rich, heavy Southern cooking of his upbringing, foods such as chicken-fried steak and biscuits and gravy. According to the media scholar Robert Thompson, the sandwich also signified [0]'s enduring all-American appeal: \"[0] wasn't only the king, [0] was one of us.\"Since 1977, there have been numerous alleged sightings of [0]. A long-standing conspiracy theory among some fans is that [0] faked his death. Adherents cite alleged discrepancies in the death certificate, reports of a wax dummy in [0]'s original coffin, and accounts of [0] planning a diversion so [0] could retire in peace. An unusually large number of fans have domestic shrines devoted to [0] and journey to sites with which [0] is connected, however faintly. Every August 16, the anniversary of his death, thousands of people gather outside Graceland and celebrate [0]'s memory with a candlelight ritual. \"With [0], it is not just [0]'s music that has survived death\", writes Ted Harrison. \"[0] has been raised, like a medieval saint, to a figure of cultic status. It is as if [0] has been canonized by acclamation.\"On the 25th anniversary of his death, The New York Times asserted, \"All the talentless impersonators and appalling black velvet paintings on display can make [0] seem little more than a perverse and distant memory. But before [0] was camp, [0] was camp's opposite: a genuine cultural force.\u00a0... [0]'s breakthroughs are underappreciated because in this rock-and-roll age, [0]'s hard-rocking music and sultry style have triumphed so completely.\" Not only [0]'s achievements but [0]'s failings as well, are seen by some cultural observers as adding to the power of [0]'s legacy, as in this description by Greil Marcus:[0] is a supreme figure in American life, one whose presence, no matter how banal or predictable, brooks no real comparisons.\u00a0...
