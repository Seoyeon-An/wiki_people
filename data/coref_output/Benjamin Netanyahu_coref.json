Benjamin Netanyahu and the Likud party were heavily defeated in the 1999 election by Ehud Barak's One Israel alliance; and Benjamin Netanyahu chose to retire from politics entirely, entering the private sector. Benjamin Netanyahu later returned to politics, and served as Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Finance under Ariel Sharon. During Minister of Finance, Benjamin Netanyahu initiated reforms of the Israeli economy that led to significant growth, before ultimately resigning over disagreements regarding the Gaza disengagement plan.Benjamin Netanyahu returned to the leadership of the Likud party in December 2005 after Ariel Sharon stepped down to form a new party, Kadima. Benjamin Netanyahu was the leader of the opposition from 2006 to 2009. After the 2009 election, Benjamin Netanyahu formed a coalition government with other right-wing parties and was sworn in as prime minister for a second time. Benjamin Netanyahu went on to lead the Likud party to victory in the 2013 and 2015 elections.

The judicial reform efforts were met with polarized reaction, with opponents of wide-ranging judicial reform holding mass protests across Israel over the course of many months. On 7 October 2023, Israel suffered a deadly attack by Hamas, triggering the 2023 Israel\u2013Hamas war. Due to Israel's failure to anticipate a deadly attack by Hamas, Benjamin Netanyahu has been criticized by opponents for presiding over Israel's biggest intelligence failure in 50 years.Benjamin Netanyahu made Benjamin Netanyahu's closeness to Donald Trump, a personal friend since the 1980s, central to Benjamin Netanyahu's political appeal in Israel from 2016.

At this time [0] became friends with Fred Trump, the father of future U.S. President Donald Trump."}, "Leader of the Opposition (1993\u20131996)": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. Prior to the 1988 Israeli legislative election, [0] returned to Israel and joined the Likud party. In the Likud party's internal elections, [0] was placed fifth on the party list. Later on [0] was elected as a Knesset member of the 12th Knesset, and was appointed as a deputy of the foreign minister Moshe Arens, and later on David Levy. Netanyahu and Levy did not cooperate and the rivalry between Netanyahu and Levy only intensified afterwards. During the Gulf War in early 1991, [0] emerged as the principal spokesman for Israel in media interviews on CNN and other news outlets. During the Madrid Conference of 1991 [0] was a member of the Israeli delegation headed by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.

Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir retired from politics shortly after the defeat of the Likud party in the 1992 Israeli legislative elections the Likud party.Following the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin, his temporary successor Shimon Peres decided to call early elections in order to give the government a mandate to advance the peace process. [0] was the Likud party's candidate for prime minister in the 1996 Israeli legislative election which took place on 29 May 1996 and were the first Israeli elections in which Israelis elected their prime minister directly. [0] hired American Republican political operative Arthur Finkelstein to run his campaign, and although the American style of sound bites and sharp attacks elicited harsh criticism,[citation needed] [0] won the 1996 Israeli legislative election which took place on 29 May 1996 and were the first Israeli elections in which Israelis elected their prime minister directly, becoming the youngest person in the history of prime minister and the first Israeli prime minister to be born in Israel (Yitzhak Rabin was born in Jerusalem, under the British Mandate of Palestine, prior to the 1948 founding of the Israeli state).Netanyahu's victory over his temporary successor Shimon Peres surprised many. The main catalyst in the downfall of his temporary successor Shimon Peres was a wave of suicide bombings shortly before the 1996 Israeli legislative election which took place on 29 May 1996 and were the first Israeli elections in which Israelis elected their prime minister directly; on 3 and 4 March 1996, Palestinians carried out two suicide bombings, killing 32 Israelis, with his temporary successor Shimon Peres seemingly unable to stop two suicide bombings. During his campaign, [0] stressed that progress in the peace process would be based on the Palestinian National Authority fulfilling the Palestinian National Authority's obligations\u2013mainly fighting terrorism\u2014and the the Likud party slogan was, \"[0] \u2013 making a safe peace\". However, although [0] won the 1996 Israeli legislative election which took place on 29 May 1996 and were the first Israeli elections in which Israelis elected their prime minister directly, his temporary successor Shimon Peres's Israeli Labor Party received more seats in the 1996 Israeli legislative election which took place on 29 May 1996 and were the first Israeli elections in which Israelis elected their prime minister directly.

A spate of [0] reinforced the Likud position for security. Hamas claimed responsibility for most of [0]. As prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu raised many questions about many central premises of the Oslo Accords. One of Benjamin Netanyahu's main points was disagreement with the Oslo premise that the negotiations should proceed in stages, meaning that concessions should be made to Palestinians before any resolution was reached on major issues, such as the status of Jerusalem, and the amending of the Palestinian National Charter. Oslo supporters had claimed that the multi-stage approach would build goodwill among Palestinians and would propel Palestinians to seek reconciliation when major issues, such as the status of Jerusalem, and the amending of the Palestinian National Charter were raised in later stages. Benjamin Netanyahu said that concessions only gave encouragement to extremist elements, without receiving any tangible gestures in return. Benjamin Netanyahu called for tangible gestures of Palestinian goodwill in return for Israeli concessions. Despite Benjamin Netanyahu's stated differences with the Oslo Accords, Benjamin Netanyahu continued the Oslo Accords's implementation, but Benjamin Netanyahu's Premiership saw a marked slow-down in the peace process.[citation needed]In 1996, Benjamin Netanyahu and Jerusalem's mayor Ehud Olmert decided to open an exit in the Arab Quarter for the Western Wall Tunnel, which prior prime minister Shimon Peres had instructed to be put on hold for the sake of peace. open sparked three days of rioting by Palestinians, resulting in dozens of both Israelis and Palestinians being killed.Benjamin Netanyahu first met Palestinian President Arafat on 4 September 1996. Prior to met, the two leaders spoke by telephone. The meetings would continue through Autumn 1996. On the two leaders's , Benjamin Netanyahu said: \"Benjamin Netanyahu would like to emphasize that we have to take into account the needs and the requirements of both sides on the basis of reciprocity and the assurance of the security and well-being of both Israelis and Palestinian alike.\" Palestinian President Arafat said: \"We are determined to work with Benjamin Netanyahu and with his government.\" The meetings culminated on 14 January 1997, in the signing of the Hebron Protocol. The signing of the Hebron Protocol with the Palestinian Authority resulted in the redeployment of Israeli forces in Hebron and the turnover of civilian authority in much of the area to the control of the Palestinian Authority.Eventually, the lack of progress of the peace process led to new negotiations which produced the Wye River Memorandum in 1998 which detailed the steps to be taken by his government and the Palestinian Authority to implement the earlier Interim Agreement of 1995. the Wye River Memorandum was signed by Benjamin Netanyahu and Oslo chairman Yasser Arafat, and on 17 November 1998, his government's 120 member parliament, the Knesset, approved the Wye River Memorandum by a vote of 75\u201319. In a nod to the 1967 Khartoum conference, Benjamin Netanyahu emphasized a policy of \"three no(s)\": no withdrawal from the Golan Heights, no discussion of the case of Jerusalem, no negotiations under any preconditions.In 1997, Benjamin Netanyahu authorized a Mossad operation to assassinate Hamas leader Khaled Mashal in Jordan, just three years after the two countries had signed a peace treaty. The Mossad team, covering as five Canadian tourists, entered Jordan on 27 September 1997 and injected poison into Hamas leader Khaled Mashal's ears in a street in Amman. a Mossad operation to assassinate Hamas leader Khaled Mashal in Jordan was exposed and two agents were arrested by the Jordanian police while three others hid in the Israeli embassy which was then surrounded by troops. An angry King Hussein demanded his government to give out the antidote and threatened to annul a peace treaty. Benjamin Netanyahu relented to the demands after pressure by US President Bill Clinton and ordered the release of 61 Jordanian and Palestinian prisoners including Sheikh Ahmad Yassin. The incident sent the nascent Israeli-Jordanian relations plummeting.During his term, Benjamin Netanyahu also began a process of economic liberalization, taking steps towards a free-market economy. Under Benjamin Netanyahu's watch, his government began selling his government's shares in banks and major state-run companies. Benjamin Netanyahu also greatly eased his government's strict foreign exchange controls, enabling Israelis to take an unrestricted amount of money out of his government, open foreign bank accounts, hold foreign currency, and invest freely in other countries.Throughout his term, Benjamin Netanyahu was opposed by the political left wing in his government and lost support from the right because of Benjamin Netanyahu's concessions to the Palestinians in Hebron and elsewhere, and due to Benjamin Netanyahu's negotiations with Palestinian President Arafat generally. Benjamin Netanyahu lost favor with the Israeli public after a long chain of scandals involving Benjamin Netanyahu's marriage and corruption charges. In 1997, police recommended that Benjamin Netanyahu be indicted on corruption charges for influence-peddling. Benjamin Netanyahu was accused of appointing an attorney general who would reduce corruption charges for influence-peddling but prosecutors ruled that there was insufficient evidence to go to trial. In 1999, Benjamin Netanyahu faced another scandal when the his government Police recommended that Benjamin Netanyahu be tried for corruption for $100,000 in free services from a government contractor; his government's attorney general did not prosecute, citing difficulties with evidence.", "Election defeat": "[0] is our person to focus on.

The salient point that has to be underlined again and again is that nothing justifies terrorism, that terrorism is evil per se \u2013 that the various real or imagined reasons proffered by the terrorists to justify the terrorists's actions are meaningless.Benjamin Netanyahu, 1995Netanyahu has said Benjamin Netanyahu's own \"hard line against all terrorists\" came as a result of his brother's's death. his brother's had been killed while leading the hostage-rescue mission at Operation Entebbe.In addition to having taken part in counter-terrorist operations during Benjamin Netanyahu's service in the military, Benjamin Netanyahu has published three books on the subject of fighting terrorism. Benjamin Netanyahu identifies terrorism as a form of totalitarianism, writing: \"The more far removed the target of the attack from any connection to the grievance enunciated by the terrorists, the greater the terror\u00a0... Yet for terrorism to have any impact, it is precisely the lack of connection, the lack of any possible involvement or \"complicity\" of the chosen victims in the cause the terrorists seek to attack, that produces the desired fear. For terrorism's underlying message is that every member of society is \"guilty\", that anyone can be a victim, and that therefore no one is safe\u00a0... In fact, the methods reveal the totalitarian strain that runs through all terrorist groups\u00a0... It is not only that the ends of the terrorists do not succeed in justifying the means the terrorists choose; the terrorists's choice of means indicate what the terrorists's true ends are. Far from being fighters for freedom, terrorists are the forerunners of tyranny. Terrorists use the techniques of violent coercion in order to achieve a regime of violent coercion.Benjamin Netanyahu cautions that \"he trouble with active anti-terror activities\u00a0... is that active anti-terror activities do constitute a substantial intrusion on the lives of those being monitored.\" Benjamin Netanyahu believes there is a balance between civil liberties and security, which should depend on the level of sustained terrorist attacks in a country. During periods of sustained attack, there should be shift towards security, due to \"the monstrous violation of personal rights which is the lot of the victims of terror and the victims of terror's families\". But this should be regularly reviewed, with an emphasis on guarding civil liberties and individual privacy wherever and whenever security considerations allow: \"The concern of civil libertarians over possible infringements of the rights of innocent citizens is well placed, and all additional powers granted the security services should require annual renewal by the legislature, this in addition to judicial oversight of actions as actions are taken in the field.\"He advises tighter immigration laws as an essential tool to preemptively combat terrorism: \"This era of immigration free-for-all should be brought to an end. An important aspect of taking control of the immigration situation is stricter background checks of potential immigrants, coupled with the real possibility of deportation.\"He also cautions that it is essential that governments do not conflate terrorists with those legitimate political groups that may or may not hold extremist views, but which advance their positions by means of debate and argument: \"Democracies have Democracies's share of anti-immigrant or anti-establishment parties, as well as advocates of extreme nationalism or internationalism\u00a0... hey are often genuinely convinced participants in democracy, accepting democracy's basic ground rules and defending democracy's central tenets. These can and must be distinguished from the tiny splinters at the absolute fringes of democratic society, which may endorse many similar ideas, but use many similar ideas as a pretext to step outside the rubric of the democratic system\".In particular, Ronald Reagan was an admirer of Benjamin Netanyahu's work on counter-terrorism, and Ronald Reagan recommended Benjamin Netanyahu's book Terrorism: How the West Can Win to all senior figures in Ronald Reagan's administration.", "Death penalty": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 2017, [0] called for the death penalty to be imposed on the perpetrator of the 2017 Halamish stabbing attack. Representatives in [0]'s government introduced a bill which would allow the death penalty for terrorism to the Knesset. In a preliminary vote in January 2018, 52 of 120 members of the Knesset voted in favor while 49 opposed, to make it easier for judges to hand down the death penalty. a bill which would allow the death penalty for terrorism would still require three more readings if a bill which would allow the death penalty for terrorism is to become law.", "LGBT rights": "[0] is our person to focus on.

In October 2014, [0] said \"We don't just hand over territory, close We's eyes and hope for the best. We did that in Lebanon and We got thousands of rockets. We did that in Gaza, We got Hamas and 15,000 rockets. So We're not gonna just replicate that. We want to see genuine recognition of Israel and rock solid security arrangements on the ground. That's the position [0]'ve held, and That's only become firmer.[0] had previously called U.S.-backed peace talks a waste of time, while at the same time refusing to commit to the same two-state solution as had other Israeli leaders, until a speech in June 2009. [0] repeatedly made public statements which advocated an \"economic peace\" approach, meaning an approach based on economic cooperation and joint effort rather than continuous contention over political and diplomatic issues. an \"economic peace\" approach, meaning an approach based on economic cooperation and joint effort rather than continuous contention over political and diplomatic issues is in line with many significant ideas from the Peace Valley plan.

It makes no sense at this point to talk about the most contractible issue. the most contractible issue's Jerusalem or bust, or right of return or bust. That has led to failure and is likely to lead to failure again\u00a0... We must weave an economic peace alongside a political process. weave means that we have to strengthen the moderate parts of the Palestinian economy by handing rapid growth in the moderate parts of the Palestinian economy, rapid economic growth that gives a stake for peace for the ordinary Palestinians.\" In January 2009, prior to the Israeli elections [0] informed Middle East envoy Tony Blair that [0] would continue the policy of the Israeli governments of Ariel Sharon and Ehud Olmert by expanding settlements in the West Bank, in contravention of the Road Map, but not building new ones.In 2013, [0] denied reports that [0]'s would agree to peace talks on the basis of the green line. In 2014 [0] agreed to the American framework based on the green line and said that Jewish settlers must be allowed the option of staying in Jewish settlers's settlements under Palestinian rule.In 2014, Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat criticized [0], calling [0] \"ideologically corrupt\" and a war criminal.In January 2020, [0] publicly supported President Clinton's Israeli-Palestinian peace plan.Former United States Secretary of State Rex Tillerson stated that on 22 May 2017, [0] showed President Clinton a fake and altered video of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas calling for the killing of children. This was at a time when President Clinton was considering if Israel was the obstacle to peace. [0] had showed President Clinton a fake and altered video of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas calling for the killing of children to change President Clinton's position in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.The U.S.-brokered Abraham Accords agreed to the full normalization of relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates (the Israel\u2013the United Arab Emirates normalization agreement) and Bahrain, respectively (the Bahrain\u2013Israel normalization agreement). This was the first time any Arab country had normalized relations with Israel since Jordan in 1994. The U.S.-brokered Abraham Accords were signed by Bahrain's foreign minister, UAE's foreign minister and [0] on 15 September 2020 at the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, D.C.On 23 October 2020, President Clinton announced that Sudan will start to normalize ties with Israel, making Sudan the third Arab state to do so as part of The U.S.-brokered Abraham Accords. Sudan fought in wars against Israel in 1948 and 1967. [0] thanked \"President Clinton and President Clinton's team above all\", saying that \"together with President Clinton we are changing history\u00a0... despite all the experts and commentators who said changing was impossible.

[0] endorsed for the first time the notion of a Palestinian state alongside Israel. a seminal address could be viewed in part as a response to Obama's 4 June speech at Cairo. Yedioth Ahronoth claimed that Obama's's words had \"resonated through Jerusalem's corridors\".As part of [0]'s proposal, [0] demanded the full demilitarization of the future Palestinian state, with no army, rockets, missiles, or control of the future Palestinian state's airspace, and said that Jerusalem would be undivided Israeli territory.

But [0] say that if Israel would have been established earlier, the Holocaust would not have occurred.\" [0] also said, \"Jerusalem is the homeland of the Jewish people, Jerusalem is where the Jewish people's identity was forged.\" [0] stated that [0] would be willing to meet with any \"Arab leader\" for negotiations without preconditions, specifically mentioning Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Lebanon. In general, a seminal address represented a new position for [0]'s on the peace process.Some right-wing members of [0]'s governing coalition criticized [0]'s remarks for the creation of a Palestinian State, believing that all of the land should come under Israeli sovereignty. Likud MK Danny Danon said that [0] went \"against the Likud platform\", while MK Uri Orbach of Habayit Hayehudi said that a seminal address had \"dangerous implications\". Opposition party Kadima leader Tzipi Livni remarked after a seminal address that Opposition party Kadima leader Tzipi Livni thinks [0] does not really believe in the two-state solution at all; Opposition party Kadima leader Tzipi Livni thought that [0] only said what [0] did as a feigned response to international pressure. Peace Now criticized a seminal address, highlighting that, in Peace Now's opinion, a seminal address did not address the Palestinians as equal partners in the peace process. The Secretary General of Peace Now, Yariv Oppenheimer, said, \"a seminal address's a rerun of Netanyahu from [0]'s first term\".On 9 August 2009, speaking at the opening of a government meeting, [0] repeated [0]'s claims from the Palestinians: \"We want an agreement with two factors, the first of which is the recognition of Israel as the national state of the Jewish people and (the second of which is) a security settlement\".a seminal address provoked mixed reaction from the international community. The Palestinian National Authority rejected the conditions on a Palestinian State given by [0]. Senior official Saeb Erekat said, \"a seminal address closed the door to permanent status negotiations\". Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum said a seminal address reflected a \"racist and extremist ideology\" and called on Arab nations to \"form stronger opposition\". Palestinian Islamic Jihad labeled a seminal address \"misleading\" and, like Hamas, demanded stronger opposition to Israel from Arab nations. According to The Jerusalem Post, some leaders advocated a third intifada in response to a seminal address.The Arab League dismissed a seminal address, declaring in a statement that \"Arabs would not make concessions regarding issues of Jerusalem and refugees\" and that \"The Arab League know [0]'s history and style of evasion\", adding that The Arab League would not recognize Israel as a Jewish state. Referring to Netanyahu's demand that Palestinians recognize Israel as the state of the Jewish people, Egypt's's president Hosni Mubarak remarked, \"You won't find anyone to answer Netanyahu's demand that Palestinians recognize Israel as the state of the Jewish people in Egypt's, or in any other place.\" Issuing a less blunt response, the Egyptian Foreign Ministry said that a seminal address was \"not complete\" and that the Egyptian Foreign Ministry hoped for another, \"different Israeli proposal which is built on the commitment to the two-state solution\". Syrian state media condemned a seminal address and wrote that \"[0] has confirmed that [0] rejects the Arab peace initiative for peace along with all the initiatives and resolutions of the Security Council to relative peace.\"Lebanese President Michel Suleiman called for unity among Arab leaders, saying that \"Arab leaders should be more united and preserve the spirit of resistance to face the Israeli stands regarding the peace process and the Palestinian refugee issue.\" \"Lebanese President Michel Suleiman called on the international community to exert more pressure on Israel to accept the Arab peace initiative for peace, as \"Lebanese President Michel Suleiman said \"Israel still has a will of military confrontation which can be proved in Israel's offensives on Lebanon and Gaza.\" Jordanian Minister of State for Media affairs and Communications, and Government spokesperson Nabil Sharif issued a statement saying \"The ideas presented by [0] do not live up to what was agreed on by the international community as a starting point for achieving a just and comprehensive peace in the region.\" Former Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad referred to a seminal address as \"bad news\".The Czech Republic praised a seminal address. \"In my's view, a seminal address is a step in the right direction. The acceptance of a Palestinian state was present there\", said mya seminal address. Obama's's press secretary, Robert Gibbs, said that a seminal address was an \"important step forward\". Obama's stated that \"the two-state solution can and must ensure both Israel's security and the Palestinians's legitimate aspirations for a viable state\". Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt stated that \"the fact that [0] uttered the word state is a small step forward\". Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt added that \"whether what [0] mentioned can be defined as a state is a subject of some debate\". France praised a seminal address but called on Israel to cease building settlements in the West Bank. French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner stated, \"French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner can only welcome the notion of a Palestinian state alongside Israel.\" The Foreign Ministry of Russia called a seminal address \"a sign of readiness for dialogue\" but said that \"a seminal address does not open up the road to resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
