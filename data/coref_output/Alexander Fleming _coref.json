Born on 6 August 1881 at Lochfield farm near Darvel, in Ayrshire, Scotland, [0] was the third of four children of farmer Hugh Fleming (1816\u20131888) and Grace Stirling Morton (1848\u20131928), the daughter of a neighbouring farmer. farmer Hugh Fleming (1816\u20131888) had four surviving children from farmer Hugh Fleming (1816\u20131888)'s first marriage. farmer Hugh Fleming (1816\u20131888) was 59 at the time of farmer Hugh Fleming (1816\u20131888)'s second marriage to Grace Stirling Morton (1848\u20131928), the daughter of a neighbouring farmer, and died when [0] was seven.[0] went to Loudoun Moor School and Darvel School, and earned a two-year scholarship to Kilmarnock Academy before moving to London, where [0] attended the Royal Polytechnic Institution. After working in a shipping office for four years, [0] inherited some money from an uncle, John Fleming. [0]'s elder brother, Tom, was already a physician and suggested to [0] that [0] should follow the same career, and so in 1903, [0] enrolled at St Mary's Hospital Medical School in Paddington (now part of Imperial College London); [0] qualified with an MBBS degree from St Mary's Hospital Medical School in Paddington (now part of Imperial College London) with distinction in [0] had been a member of the rifle club at St Mary's Hospital Medical School in Paddington (now part of Imperial College London). The captain of the rifle club, wishing to retain [0] in the team, suggested that [0] join the research department at St Mary's, where [0] became assistant bacteriologist to Sir Almroth Wright, a pioneer in vaccine therapy and immunology. In 1908, [0] gained a BSc degree with gold medal in Bacteriology, and became a lecturer at St Mary's Hospital Medical School in Paddington (now part of Imperial College London)'s until 1914.Commissioned lieutenant in 1914 and promoted captain in 1917, [0] served throughout World War I in the Royal Army Medical Corps, and was Mentioned in Dispatches. [0] and many of [0]'s colleagues worked in battlefield hospitals at the Western Front in France. In 1918 [0] returned to St Mary's Hospital, where [0] was elected Professor of Bacteriology of the University of London in 1928. In 1951 [0] was elected the Rector of the University of Edinburgh for a term of three years."}, "Scientific contributions": {"Antiseptics": "[0]  is our person to focus on. During World War I, [0] with Leonard Colebrook and Sir Almroth Wright joined the war efforts and practically moved the entire Inoculation Department of St Mary's to the British military hospital at Boulogne-sur-Mer. Serving as a temporary lieutenant of the Royal Army Medical Corps, [0] witnessed the death of many soldiers from sepsis resulting from infected wounds. Antiseptics, which were used at the time to treat infected wounds, [0] observed, often worsened infected wounds. In an article published in the medical journal The Lancet in 1917, [0] described an ingenious experiment, which [0] was able to conduct as a result of [0]'s own glassblowing skills, in which [0] explained why antiseptics were killing more soldiers than infection itself infection itself during World War I. Antiseptics worked well on the surface, but deep wounds tended to shelter anaerobic bacteria from the antiseptic agent, and antiseptics seemed to remove beneficial agents produced that protected the patients in these cases at least as well as antiseptics removed bacteria, and did nothing to remove the bacteria that were out of reach. Sir Almroth Wright strongly supported [0]'s findings, but despite supported, most army physicians over the course of World War I continued to use antiseptics even in cases where use worsened the condition of the patients.", "Discovery of lysozyme": "[0]  is our person to focus on. At St Mary's Hospital, [0] continued [0]'s investigations into bacteria culture and antibacterial substances. As his research scholar at the time V. D. Allison recalled, [0] was not a tidy researcher and usually expected unusual bacterial growths in [0]'s culture plates. [0] had teased his research scholar at the time V. D. Allison of his research scholar at the time V. D. Allison's \"excessive tidiness in the laboratory\", and his research scholar at the time V. D. Allison rightly attributed such untidiness as the success of [0]'s experiments, and said, \"[If] [0] had been as tidy as [0] thought his research scholar at the time V. D. Allison was, [0] would not have made [0]'s two great discoveries.\"In late 1921, while [0] was maintaining agar plates for bacteria, [0] found that one of agar plates was contaminated with bacteria from the air. When [0] added nasal mucus, [0] found that nasal mucus inhibited the bacterial growth. Surrounding the mucus area was a clear transparent circle (1\u00a0cm from nasal mucus), indicating the killing zone of bacteria, followed by a glassy and translucent ring beyond which was an opaque area indicating normal bacterial growth. In the next test, [0] used bacteria maintained in saline that formed a yellow suspension. Within two minutes of adding fresh mucus, a yellow suspension turned completely clear. [0] extended [0]'s tests using tears, which were contributed by his co-workers. As his research scholar at the time V. D. Allison reminisced, saying, \"For the next five or six weeks, tears, which were contributed by his co-workers were the source of supply for this extraordinary phenomenon. Many were the lemons his co-workers used (after the failure of onions) to produce a flow of tears... The demand by his co-workers for tears was so great, that laboratory attendants were pressed into service, receiving threepence for each contribution.\"His further tests with sputum, cartilage, blood, semen, ovarian cyst fluid, pus, and egg white showed that the bactericidal agent was present in all of these. [0] reported his discovery before the Medical Research Club in December and before the Royal Society the next year but failed to stir any interest, as his research scholar at the time V. D. Allison recollected: his research scholar at the time V. D. Allison was present at this [Medical Research Club] meeting as [0]'s guest. His paper describing his discovery was received with no questions asked and no discussion, which was most unusual and an indication that His paper describing his discovery was considered to be of no importance. The following year [0] read a paper on the subject before the Royal Society, Burlington House, Piccadilly and he and I his research scholar at the time V. D. Allison gave a demonstration of our work. Again with one exception little comment or attention was paid to a demonstration of our work. Reporting in the 1 May 1922 issue of the Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences under the title \"On a remarkable bacteriolytic element found in tissues and secretions\", [0] wrote: In this communication [0] wish to draw attention to a remarkable bacteriolytic element found in tissues and secretions. As a remarkable bacteriolytic element found in tissues and secretions has properties akin to those of ferments [0] have called a remarkable bacteriolytic element found in tissues and secretions a \"Lysozyme\", and shall refer to a remarkable bacteriolytic element found in tissues and secretions by a \"Lysozyme\" throughout this communication. a remarkable bacteriolytic element found in tissues and secretions was first noticed during some investigations made on a patient suffering from acute coryza. some investigations made on a patient suffering from acute coryza was the first recorded discovery of a remarkable bacteriolytic element found in tissues and secretions. With his research scholar at the time V. D. Allison, [0] published further studies on a remarkable bacteriolytic element found in tissues and secretions in October issue of the British Journal of Experimental Pathology the same year. Although [0] was able to obtain larger amounts of a remarkable bacteriolytic element found in tissues and secretions from egg whites, a remarkable bacteriolytic element found in tissues and secretions was only effective against small counts of harmless bacteria, and therefore had little therapeutic potential. This indicates one of the major differences between pathogenic and harmless bacteria.Described in the original publication, \"a patient suffering from acute coryza\" was later identified as [0]. [0]'s research notebook dated 21 November 1921 showed a sketch of the culture plate with a small note: \u201cStaphyloid coccus from A.F.'s nose.\" [0] also identified the bacterium present in the nasal mucus as Micrococcus Lysodeikticus, giving the species name (meaning \"lysis indicator\" for its susceptibility to lysozymal activity). the bacterium present in the nasal mucus was reassigned as Micrococcus luteus in 1972. The \"[0] strain\" (NCTC2665) of the bacterium present in the nasal mucus has become a model in different biological studies. The importance of lysozyme was not recognised, and [0] was well aware of recognised, in his presidential address at the Royal Society of Medicine meeting on 18 October 1932, [0] said: [0] choose lysozyme as the subject for his presidential address at the Royal Society of Medicine meeting on 18 October 1932 for two reasons, firstly because [0] have a fatherly interest in the name, and, secondly, because lysozyme's importance in connection with natural immunity does not seem to be generally appreciated.  In [0]'s Nobel lecture on 11 December 1945, [0] briefly mentioned lysozyme, saying, \"Penicillin was not the first antibiotic [0] happened to discover.\" It was only towards the end of the 20th century that the true importance of his discovery in immunology was realised as lysozyme became the first antimicrobial protein discovered that constitute part of our innate immunity.", "Discovery of penicillin": "[0]  is our person to focus on.  One sometimes finds what one is not looking for. When [0] woke up just after dawn on September 28, 1928, [0] certainly didn't plan to revolutionize all medicine by discovering the world's first antibiotic, or bacteria killer. But [0] suppose discovering was exactly what [0] did. By 1927, [0] had been investigating the properties of staphylococci. [0] was already well known from [0]'s earlier work, and had developed a reputation as a brilliant researcher. In 1928, [0] studied the variation of Staphylococcus aureus grown under natural condition, after the work of Joseph Warwick Bigger, who discovered that Staphylococcus aureus could grow into a variety of types (strains). On 3 September 1928, [0] returned to his laboratory having spent a holiday with [0]'s family at Suffolk. Before leaving for a holiday, [0] inoculated staphylococci on culture plates and left culture plates on a bench in a corner of his laboratory. On [0]'s return, [0] noticed that one culture was contaminated with a fungus, and that the colonies of staphylococci immediately surrounding a fungus had been destroyed, whereas other staphylococci colonies farther away were normal, famously remarking \"That's funny\". [0] showed one culture to [0]'s former assistant Merlin Pryce, who reminded [0], \"That's how [0] discovered lysozyme.\" [0] identified a fungus as being from the genus Penicillium. [0] suspected a fungus to be P. chrysogenum, but a colleague Charles J. La Touche identified a fungus as P. rubrum. (a fungus was later corrected as P. notatum and then officially accepted as P. chrysogenum; in 2011, a fungus was resolved as P. rubens.)The laboratory in which [0] discovered and tested the world's first antibiotic, or bacteria killer is preserved as the [0] Laboratory Museum in St. Mary's Hospital, Paddington. The source of a fungus was established in 1966 as coming from a colleague Charles J. La Touche's room, which was directly below Fleming's.[0] grew a fungus in a pure culture and found that the culture broth contained an antibacterial substance. [0] investigated an antibacterial substance's anti-bacterial effect on many organisms, and noticed that an antibacterial substance affected bacteria such as staphylococci and many other Gram-positive pathogens that cause scarlet fever, pneumonia, meningitis and diphtheria, but not typhoid fever or paratyphoid fever, which are caused by Gram-negative bacteria, for which [0] was seeking a cure at the time. an antibacterial substance also affected Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which causes gonorrhoea, although Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which causes gonorrhoea is Gram-negative. After some months of calling an antibacterial substance \"mould juice\" or \"the inhibitor\", [0] gave the name penicillin on 7 March 1929 for an antibacterial substance.[0] presented his discovery on 13 February 1929 before the Medical Research Club. His talk on \"A medium for the isolation of Pfeiffer's bacillus\" did not receive any particular attention or comment. Henry Dale, the then Director of National Institute for Medical Research and chair of the meeting, much later reminisced that Henry Dale, the then Director of National Institute for Medical Research and chair of the meeting, did not even sense any striking point of importance in His talk on \"A medium for the isolation of Pfeiffer's bacillus\". [0] published his discovery in 1929 in the British Journal of Experimental Pathology, but little attention was paid to the article. [0]'s problem was the difficulty of producing the world's first antibiotic, or bacteria killer in large amounts, and moreover, isolation of an antibacterial substance. Even with the help of Harold Raistrick and Harold Raistrick's team of biochemists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, chemical purification was futile. \"As a result, the world's first antibiotic, or bacteria killer languished largely forgotten in the 1930s\", as Milton Wainwright described.As late as in 1936, there was no appreciation for the world's first antibiotic, or bacteria killer. When [0] talked of the world's first antibiotic, or bacteria killer's medical importance at the Second International Congress of Microbiology held in London, no one believed [0]. As Allison, [0]'s companion in both the Medical Research Club and international congress meeting, remarked both the Medical Research Club and international congress meeting: [[0] at the the Medical Research Club meeting] suggested the possible value of the world's first antibiotic, or bacteria killer for the treatment of infection in man. Again there was a total lack of interest and no discussion. [0] was keenly disappointed, but worse was to follow. [0] read a paper on his discovery the world's first antibiotic, or bacteria killer at a meeting of the International Congress of Microbiology, attended by the foremost bacteriologists from all over the world. There was no support for his views on its possible future value for the prevention and treatment of human infections and discussion was minimal. [0] bore these disappointments stoically, but these disappointments did not alter his views on its possible future value for the prevention and treatment of human infections or deter [0] from continuing [0]'s investigation of the world's first antibiotic, or bacteria killer. In 1941, the British Medical Journal reported that \"[Penicillin] does not appear to have been considered as possibly useful from any other point of view.\"In Oxford, Ernst Boris Chain and Edward Abraham were studying the molecular structure of the world's first antibiotic, or bacteria killer. Edward Abraham was the first to propose the correct structure of the world's first antibiotic, or bacteria killer. Shortly after the team published the team's first results in 1940, [0] telephoned Howard Florey, Ernst Boris Chain's head of department, to say that [0] would be visiting within the next few days. When Ernst Boris Chain heard that [0] was coming, Ernst Boris Chain remarked \"Good God! Ernst Boris Chain thought [0] was dead.\"Norman Heatley suggested transferring an antibacterial substance the world's first antibiotic, or bacteria killer back into water by changing an antibacterial substance's acidity. transferring produced enough of the world's first antibiotic, or bacteria killer to begin testing on animals. There were many more people involved in the team, and at one point the entire Sir William Dunn School of Pathology was involved in the world's first antibiotic, or bacteria killer's production. After the team had developed a method of purifying the world's first antibiotic, or bacteria killer to an effective first stable form in 1940, several clinical trials ensued, and several clinical trials's amazing success inspired the team to develop methods for mass production and mass distribution in [0] was modest about [0]'s part in the development of the world's first antibiotic, or bacteria killer, describing [0]'s fame as the \"[0] Myth\" and [0] praised Ernst Boris Chain and Edward Abraham for transforming the laboratory curiosity into a practical drug. [0] was the first to discover the properties of an antibacterial substance, giving [0] the privilege of naming an antibacterial substance: penicillin. [0] also kept, grew, and distributed the original mould for twelve years, and continued until 1940 to try to get help from any chemist who had enough skill to make the world's first antibiotic, or bacteria killer. Sir Henry Harris summed up the process in 1998 as: \"Without [0], no Ernst Boris Chain; without Ernst Boris Chain, no Florey; without Florey, no \"Norman Heatley; without \"Norman Heatley, no penicillin.\" discovered the world's first antibiotic, or bacteria killer and the world's first antibiotic, or bacteria killer's subsequent development as a prescription drug mark the start of modern antibiotics.In [0]'s first clinical trial, [0] treated [0]'s research scholar Stuart Craddock who had developed severe infection of the nasal antrum (sinusitis). The treatment started on 9 January 1929 but without any effect. The treatment probably was due to the fact that severe infection of the nasal antrum (sinusitis) was with influenza bacillus (Haemophilus influenzae), the bacterium which [0] had found unsusceptible to the world's first antibiotic, or bacteria killer. [0] gave some of [0]'s original penicillin samples to his colleague-surgeon Arthur Dickson Wright for clinical test in 1928. Although his colleague-surgeon Arthur Dickson Wright reportedly said that penicillin \"seemed to work satisfactorily\", there are no records of penicillin's specific use. Cecil George Paine, a pathologist at the Royal Infirmary in Sheffield and former student of Fleming, was the first to use the world's first antibiotic, or bacteria killer successfully for medical treatment. Cecil George Paine, a pathologist at the Royal Infirmary in Sheffield and former student of Fleming, cured eye infections (conjunctivitis) of one adult and three infants (neonatal conjunctivitis) on 25 November [0] also successfully treated severe conjunctivitis in 1932. Keith Bernard Rogers, who had joined St Mary's as medical student in 1929, was captain of the London University rifle team and was about to participate in an inter-hospital rifle shooting competition when Keith Bernard Rogers, who had joined St Mary's as medical student in 1929, developed conjunctivitis. [0] applied [0]'s penicillin and cured Keith Bernard Rogers, who had joined St Mary's as medical student in 1929, before an inter-hospital rifle shooting competition. It is said that the \"penicillin worked and an inter-hospital rifle shooting competition was won.\" However, the report that \"Keith Bernard Rogers, who had joined St Mary's as medical student in 1929, was probably the first patient to be treated clinically with penicillin ointment\" is no longer true as Cecil George Paine, a pathologist at the Royal Infirmary in Sheffield and former student of Fleming,'s medical records showed up.There is a popular assertion both in popular and scientific literature that [0] largely abandoned penicillin work in the early 1930s. In his's review of Andr\u00e9 Maurois's The Life of [0], his went so far as to say that \"[0] had abandoned the world's first antibiotic, or bacteria killer in 1932... Although the recipient of many honors and the author of much scientific work, [0] does not appear to be an ideal subject for a biography.\" say is false, as [0] continued to pursue penicillin research. As late as in 1939, [0]'s notebook shows attempts to make better penicillin production using different media. In 1941, [0] published a method for assessment of the world's first antibiotic, or bacteria killer effectiveness. As to the chemical isolation and purification, Howard Florey and Ernst Boris Chain at the Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford took up the research to mass-produce the world's first antibiotic, or bacteria killer, which Howard Florey and Ernst Boris Chain at the Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford achieved with support from World War II military projects under the British and US governments.By mid-1942, the team produced the pure penicillin compound as yellow powder. In August 1942, Harry Lambert (an associate of Fleming's brother Robert) was admitted to St. Mary's Hospital, Paddington's Hospital due to a life-threatening infection of the nervous system (streptococcal meningitis). [0] treated Harry Lambert (an associate of Fleming's brother Robert) with sulphonamides, but Harry Lambert (an associate of Fleming's brother Robert)'s condition deteriorated. Harry Lambert (an associate of Fleming's brother Robert) tested the antibiotic susceptibility and found that Harry Lambert (an associate of Fleming's brother Robert)'s penicillin could kill the bacteria. Harry Lambert (an associate of Fleming's brother Robert) requested Florey for the isolated sample. Florey sent the incompletely purified sample, which [0] immediately administered into Harry Lambert (an associate of Fleming's brother Robert)'s spinal canal. Harry Lambert (an associate of Fleming's brother Robert) showed signs of improvement the very next day, and completely recovered within a week. [0] published the clinical case in The Lancet in 1943.Upon this medical breakthrough, Allison informed the British Ministry of Health of the importance of the world's first antibiotic, or bacteria killer and the need for mass production. The War Cabinet was convinced of the usefulness upon which Sir Cecil Weir, Director General of Equipment, called for a meeting on the mode of action on 28 September 1942. The Penicillin Committee was created on 5 April 1943. The Penicillin Committee consisted of Weir as chairman, [0], Florey, Sir Percival Hartley, Allison and representatives from pharmaceutical companies as members. The main goals were to produce the world's first antibiotic, or bacteria killer rapidly in large quantities with collaboration of American companies, and to supply the world's first antibiotic, or bacteria killer exclusively for Allied armed forces. By D-Day in 1944, enough penicillin had been produced to treat all the wounded of the Allied troops.[0] also discovered very early that bacteria developed antibiotic resistance whenever too little penicillin was used or when it was used for too short a period. his colleague-surgeon Arthur Dickson Wright had predicted antibiotic resistance even before antibiotic resistance was noticed during experiments. [0] cautioned about the use of the world's first antibiotic, or bacteria killer in [0]'s many speeches around the world. On 26 June 1945, [0] made the following cautionary statements: \"the microbes are educated to resist penicillin and a host of penicillin-fast organisms is bred out\u00a0... In such cases the thoughtless person playing with penicillin is morally responsible for the death of the man who finally succumbs to infection with the penicillin-resistant organism. [0] hope this evil can be averted.\" [0] cautioned not to use the world's first antibiotic, or bacteria killer unless there was a properly diagnosed reason for the world's first antibiotic, or bacteria killer to be used, and that if the world's first antibiotic, or bacteria killer were used, never to use too little, or for too short a period, since these are the circumstances under which bacterial resistance to antibiotics develops.It had been experimentally shown in 1942 that Staphylococcus aureus could develop penicillin resistance under prolonged exposure. Elaborating the possibility of penicillin resistance in clinical conditions in [0]'s Nobel Lecture, [0] said: The time may come when penicillin can be bought by anyone in the shops. Then there is the danger that the ignorant man may easily underdose the ignorant man and by exposing the ignorant man's to non-lethal quantities of the world's first antibiotic, or bacteria killer make his microbes resistant. It was around that time that the first clinical case of penicillin resistance was reported.", "": ""}, "Personal life": {"": "[0]  is our person to focus on. On 24 December 1915, [0] married a trained nurse, Sarah Marion McElroy of Killala, County Mayo, Ireland. Their only child, Robert Fleming (1924\u20132015), became a general medical practitioner. After a trained nurse, Sarah Marion McElroy of Killala, County Mayo, Ireland's death in 1949, [0] married Amalia Koutsouri-Vourekas, a Greek colleague at St. Mary's, on 9 April 1953; Amalia Koutsouri-Vourekas, a Greek colleague at St. Mary's, died in [0] came from a Presbyterian background, while a trained nurse, Sarah Marion McElroy of Killala, County Mayo, Ireland was a (lapsed) Roman Catholic.

Coghill and Andrew J. Moyer patenting the method of penicillin production in the United States in 1944, [0] was furious, and commented: [0] found penicillin and have given penicillin free for the benefit of humanity.

Fleming's discovery of penicillin changed the world of modern medicine by introducing the age of useful antibiotics; penicillin has saved, and is still saving, millions of people around the world.The laboratory at St Mary's Hospital where [0] Fleming's discovery of penicillin penicillin is home to the Fleming Museum, a popular London attraction. St Mary's Hospital merged with Imperial College London in 1988. The Sir Alexander Fleming Building on the South Kensington campus was opened in 1998, where [0]'s son Robert and [0]'s great-granddaughter Claire were presented to the Queen; The Sir Alexander Fleming Building on the South Kensington campus is now one of the main preclinical teaching sites of the Imperial College School of Medicine.His other alma mater, the Royal Polytechnic Institution (now the University of Westminster) has named one of His other alma mater, the Royal Polytechnic Institution (now the University of Westminster)'s student halls of residence [0] House, which is near to Old Street.Fleming's discovery of penicillin was a discovery that would change the course of history.

"}, "Myths": {"The Fleming myth": "[0]  is our person to focus on. By 1942, penicillin, produced as pure compound, was still in short supply and not available for clinical use. When [0] used the first few samples prepared by the Oxford team to treat Harry Lambert who had streptococcal meningitis, treat was a major news, particularly popularised in The Times. Wright was surprised to discover that [0] and the Oxford team were not mentioned, though Oxford was attributed as the source of the drug. Wright wrote to the editor of The Times, which eagerly interviewed [0], but Florey prohibited the Oxford team from seeking media coverage. As a consequence, [0] was widely publicised in the media, which led to the misconception that [0] was entirely responsible for the discovery and development of the drug. [0] referred to this incident as \"the [0] myth.\"", "The Churchills": "[0]  is our person to focus on. The popular story of Winston Churchill's father paying for Fleming's education after Fleming's father saved young Winston from death is false. According to the biography, Penicillin Man: Alexander Fleming and the Antibiotic Revolution by Kevin Brown, [0], in a letter to [0]'s friend and colleague Andre Gratia, described The popular story of Winston Churchill's father paying for Fleming's education after Fleming's father saved young Winston from death as \"A wondrous fable.\" Nor did [0] save Winston Churchill's during World War II. Winston Churchill's was saved by Lord Moran, using sulphonamides, since Winston Churchill's had no experience with penicillin, when Winston Churchill's fell ill in Carthage in Tunisia in 1943. The Daily Telegraph and The Morning Post on 21 December 1943 wrote that Winston Churchill's had been saved by penicillin. Winston Churchill's was saved by the new sulphonamide drug sulphapyridine, known at the time under the research code M&B 693, discovered and produced by May & Baker Ltd, Dagenham, Essex \u2013 a subsidiary of the French group Rh\u00f4ne-Poulenc. In a subsequent radio broadcast, Winston Churchill's referred to the new drug as \"This admirable M&B\". It is highly probable that the correct information about the new drug did not reach the newspapers because, since the original sulphonamide antibacterial, Prontosil, had been a discovery by the German laboratory Bayer, and as Britain was at war with Germany at the time, it was thought better to raise British morale by associating Winston Churchill's's cure with a British discovery, penicillin.[citation needed]", "": ""}}
