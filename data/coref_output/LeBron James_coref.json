Standing 6\u00a0feet 9\u00a0inches (2.06\u00a0m) tall and weighing 250 pounds (113\u00a0kg), [0] has played the majority of [0]'s career at the small forward and power forward positions, but [0] has also been deployed at the other positions when necessary. [0]'s playing style, which is athletic and versatile, has drawn comparisons to Basketball Hall of Famers Oscar Robertson, Magic Johnson, and Michael Jordan. Through the 2022\u201323 season, [0]'s career averages are 27.2 points, 7.5 rebounds, 7.3 assists, 1.5 steals, and 0.8 blocks per game. Throughout the 2010s, [0] was usually ranked as the best player in the NBA each season by ESPN and Sports Illustrated.", "Offense": "[0] is our person to focus on. As an 18-year-old rookie, [0] led the Cavaliers in scoring. [0] holds numerous \"youngest to\" distinctions, including being the youngest player to score 30,000 career points. During [0]'s first stint in Cleveland, [0] was primarily used as an on-ball point forward, and although [0]'s shooting tendencies were perimeter-oriented, [0] established [0] as one of the best slashers and finishers in basketball. His combination of speed, quickness, and size often created matchup problems for opposing teams because [0] was capable of blowing by larger defenders and overpowering smaller ones. His combination of speed, quickness, and size became more apparent in transition, where [0] developed a reputation for grabbing defensive rebounds and then beating the defense downcourt for highlight reel baskets. Around this time, [0] was frequently criticized for not having a reliable jump shot or post game. Teams would try to exploit these weaknesses by giving [0] space in the half court and forcing [0] to settle for three-pointers and long two-pointers, a strategy famously used by Spurs coach Gregg Popovich in the 2007 Finals, where [0] converted on only 36 percent of [0]'s field goals in four games.In Miami, Heat coach Erik Spoelstra changed [0]'s role to a more unconventional one. [0] spent more time in the post and improved [0]'s shot selection and accuracy on jump shots. [0] also learned how to work as an off-ball cutter in Heat's \"pass-happy\" offense. Behind these improvements, [0]'s overall scoring efficiency rose to historically great levels. During this time, ESPN's Tom Haberstroh called James's free-throw shooting [0]'s biggest weakness, describing James's free-throw shooting as \"average\". Upon returning to the Cavaliers, [0] began to experience subtle age-related declines in productivity, posting [0]'s lowest scoring averages since [0]'s rookie season in 2015 and 2016. [0]'s shooting also temporarily regressed, and [0] briefly ranked as the NBA's's worst high-volume shooter from outside the paint. Despite these changes, [0] remained an elite offensive player who beat defenses with body control, strength, and varying attacking speeds.For most of [0]'s career, [0] has controlled the offense as the primary ball handler on [0]'s team. [0]'s playmaking ability is generally considered one of [0]'s premier skills, and some analysts rank [0] among the greatest passers in the NBA's history. By exploiting his size, vision, and the attention [0] garners from opposing defenses, [0] creates easy points for [0]'s teammates with accurate assists. [0] executes unconventional passes, including after leaving [0]'s feet and through defensive traffic. [0]'s uncanny tendency to find the open man has helped force the NBA's to incorporate some elements of zone into NBA teams's schemes to better cover the weak side of the court and prevent [0] from passing to open shooters. Early in James's career, [0] was criticized for overpassing in pressure situations, in particular for passing instead of shooting in the waning seconds of close games; however, as James's career progressed, [0]'s clutch performance was viewed more favorably.", "Defense": "[0] is our person to focus on. At the beginning of [0]'s NBA career, [0] was considered a poor defensive player, but [0] improved steadily through the years. In 2009, [0] became proficient at the chase-down block, which involves coming in from behind the opposition in transition to block the shot. In Miami, [0] developed into a more versatile defensive player, and the Heat relied on [0] to guard all five positions. Along with Shane Battier and Dwyane Wade, Miami used [0] in an ultra-aggressive defensive scheme, with [0] cheating off the ball to help out inside or get into rebounding position. Beginning in 2014, some analysts reported a regression in [0]'s defensive impact, stemming from a lack of effort and expected age-related declines. During [0]'s second stint in Cleveland, [0]'s defense progressively declined. After missed drives on offense, [0] often dawdled back on defense while complaining to the referees; [0] provided less help off the ball, and was less aggressive in switching.
