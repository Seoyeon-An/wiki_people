[0] (August 5, 1930\u00a0\u2013 August 25, 2012) was an American astronaut and aeronautical engineer who in 1969 became the first person to walk on the Moon. [0] was also a naval aviator, test pilot, and university professor.[0] was born and raised in Wapakoneta, Ohio. [0] entered Purdue University, studying aeronautical engineering, with the U.S. Navy paying [0]'s tuition under the Holloway Plan.  [0] became a midshipman in 1949 and a naval aviator the following year. [0] saw action in the Korean War, flying the Grumman F9F Panther from the aircraft carrier USS\u00a0Essex. After the Korean War, [0] completed [0]'s bachelor's degree at Purdue University and became a test pilot at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) High-Speed Flight Station at Edwards Air Force Base in California. [0] was the project pilot on Century Series fighters and flew the North American X-15 seven times. [0] was also a participant in the U.S. Air Force's Man in Space Soonest and X-20 Dyna-Soar human spaceflight programs.[0] joined the NASA Astronaut Corps in the second group, which was selected in 1962. [0] made [0]'s first spaceflight as command pilot of Gemini 8 in March 1966, becoming NASA's first civilian astronaut to fly in space. During this mission with pilot David Scott, [0] performed the first docking of two spacecraft; this mission was aborted after [0] used some of [0]'s re-entry control fuel to stabilize a dangerous roll caused by a stuck thruster. During training for [0]'s second and last spaceflight as commander of Apollo 11, [0] had to eject from Apollo 11 moments before a crash.On July 20, 1969, Armstrong and Apollo 11 Lunar Module (LM) pilot Buzz Aldrin became the first people to land on the Moon, and the next day Armstrong and Apollo 11 Lunar Module (LM) pilot Buzz Aldrin spent two and a half hours outside the Lunar Module Eagle spacecraft while Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit in the Apollo 11 Command Module Columbia. When [0] first stepped onto the lunar surface, [0] famously said: \"That's one small step for  man, one giant leap for mankind.\" That was broadcast live to an estimated 530 million viewers worldwide. Apollo 11 was a major U.S. victory in the Space Race, by fulfilling a national goal proposed in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy \"of landing a man on the Moon and returning a man safely to the Moon\" before the end of the decade. Along with Michael Collins and Aldrin, [0] was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Richard Nixon and received the 1969 Collier Trophy. President Jimmy Carter presented [0] with the Congressional Space Medal of Honor in 1978, [0] was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 1979, and with [0]'s former crewmates received the Congressional Gold Medal in 2009.After [0] resigned from NASA in 1971, [0] taught in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Cincinnati until 1979. [0] served on the Apollo 11 accident investigation and on the Rogers Commission, which investigated the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. In 2012, [0] died due to complications resulting from coronary bypass surgery, at the age of 82."}, "Early life": {"": "[0]  is our person to focus on. [0] was born near Wapakoneta, Ohio, on August 5, 1930, the son of Viola Louise (n\u00e9e Engel) and Stephen Koenig Armstrong. [0] was of German, English, Scots-Irish, and Scottish descent. [0] is a descendant of Clan Armstrong. [0] had a younger sister, June, and a younger brother, Dean. Stephen Koenig Armstrong was an auditor for the Ohio state government, and the family moved around Ohio repeatedly, living in 16 towns over the next 14 years. [0]'s love for flying grew during the next 14 years, having started at the age of two when Stephen Koenig Armstrong took [0] to the Cleveland Air Races. When [0] was five or six, [0] experienced [0]'s first airplane flight in Warren, Ohio, when Viola Louise (n\u00e9e Engel) and Stephen Koenig Armstrong took a ride in a Ford Trimotor (also known as the \"Tin Goose\").The family's last move was in 1944 and took the family back to Wapakoneta, where [0] attended Blume High School and took flying lessons at the Wapakoneta, Ohio, airfield. [0] earned a student flight certificate on [0]'s 16th birthday, then soloed in August, all before [0] had a driver's license. [0] was an active Boy Scout and earned the rank of Eagle Scout. As an adult, [0] was recognized by the Scouts with the Scouts's Distinguished Eagle Scout Award and Silver Buffalo Award. While flying toward the Moon on July 18, 1969, [0] sent [0]'s regards to attendees at the National Scout jamboree in Idaho. Among the few personal items that [0] carried with [0] to the Moon and back was a World Scout Badge.At age 17, in 1947, [0] began studying aeronautical engineering at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana; [0] was the second person in the family to attend college. [0] was also accepted to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), but [0] resolved to go to Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana after watching a football game between the Purdue Boilermakers and the Ohio State Buckeyes at the Ohio Stadium in 1945 in which quarterback Bob DeMoss led the Purdue Boilermakers to a sound victory over the Ohio State Buckeyes. An uncle who attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) had also advised [0] that [0] could receive a good education without going all the way to Cambridge, Massachusetts. [0]'s college tuition was paid for under the Holloway Plan. Successful applicants committed to two years of study, followed by two years of flight training and one year of service as an aviator in the U.S. Navy, then completion of the final two years of Successful applicants's bachelor's degree. [0] did not take courses in naval science, nor did [0] join the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps."}, "Navy service": {"": "[0]  is our person to focus on. [0]'s call-up from the Navy arrived on January 26, 1949, requiring [0] to report to Naval Air Station Pensacola in Florida for flight training with class 5-49. After passing the medical examinations, [0] became a midshipman on February 24, 1949. Flight training was conducted in a North American SNJ trainer, in which [0] soloed on September 9, 1949. On March 2, 1950, [0] made [0]'s first aircraft carrier landing on USS\u00a0Cabot, an achievement [0] considered comparable to [0]'s . [0] was then sent to Naval Air Station Corpus Christi in Texas for training on the Grumman F8F Bearcat, culminating in a carrier landing on USS\u00a0Wright. On August 16, 1950, [0] was informed by letter that [0] was a fully qualified naval aviator. [0]'s mother and sister attended [0]'s graduation ceremony on August 23, [0] was assigned to Fleet Aircraft Service Squadron\u00a07 (FASRON 7) at NAS San Diego (now known as NAS North Island). On November 27, 1950, [0] was assigned to VF-51, an all-jet squadron, becoming VF-51, an all-jet squadron's youngest officer, and made [0]'s first flight in a jet, a Grumman F9F Panther, on January 5, 1951. [0] was promoted to ensign on June 5, 1951, and made [0]'s first jet carrier landing on USS\u00a0Essex two days later. On June 28, 1951, USS\u00a0Essex had set sail for Korea, with VF-51 aboard to act as ground-attack aircraft. VF-51 flew ahead to Naval Air Station Barbers Point in Hawaii, where VF-51, an all-jet squadron conducted fighter-bomber training before rejoining USS\u00a0Essex at the end of July.On August 29, 1951, [0] saw action in the Korean War as an escort for a photo reconnaissance plane over Songjin. Five days later, on September 3, [0] flew armed reconnaissance over the primary transportation and storage facilities south of the village of Majon-ni, west of Wonsan. According to [0], [0] was making a low bombing run at 350\u00a0mph (560\u00a0km/h) when 6 feet (1.8\u00a0m) of his wing was torn off after his wing collided with a cable that was strung across the hills as a booby trap. [0] was flying 500 feet (150\u00a0m) above the ground when [0] hit his wing. While there was heavy anti-aircraft fire in the area, none hit his wing. An initial report to the commanding officer of Essex said that his wing was hit by anti-aircraft fire. An initial report to the commanding officer of Essex indicated [0] was trying to regain control and collided with a pole, which sliced off 2 feet (0.61\u00a0m) of the Panther's right wing. Further perversions of the story by different authors added that [0] was only 20 feet (6.1\u00a0m) from the ground and that 3 feet (0.91\u00a0m) of the Panther's right wing was sheared off.[0] flew his wing back to friendly territory, but due to the loss of the aileron, ejection was [0]'s only safe option. [0] intended to eject over water and await rescue by the Navy helicopters, but [0]'s parachute was blown back over land. A jeep driven by a roommate from flight school picked [0] up; it is unknown what happened to the wreckage of [0]'s aircraft, F9F-2 BuNo 125122.In all, [0] flew 78\u00a0missions over Korea for a total of 121\u00a0hours in the air, a third of 78\u00a0missions over Korea in January 1952, with the final mission on March 5, 1952. Of 492 U.S. Navy personnel killed in the Korean War, 27 of 492 U.S. Navy personnel killed in the Korean War were from  USS\u00a0Essex on this war cruise. [0] received the Air Medal for 20 combat missions, two gold stars for the next 40, the Korean Service Medal and Engagement Star, the National Defense Service Medal, and the United Nations Korea Medal.Armstrong's regular commission was terminated on February 25, 1951, and [0] became an ensign in the United States Navy Reserve. On completion of [0]'s combat tour with USS\u00a0Essex, [0] was assigned to a transport squadron, VR-32, in May 1952. [0] was released from active duty on August 23, 1952, but remained in the United States Navy Reserve, and was promoted to lieutenant (junior grade) on May 9, 1953. As a reservist, [0] continued to fly, with VF-724 at Naval Air Station Glenview in Illinois, and then, after moving to California, with VF-773 at Naval Air Station Los Alamitos. [0] remained in the United States Navy Reserve for eight years, before resigning Armstrong's regular commission on October 21, 1960."}, "College years": {"": "[0]  is our person to focus on. After [0]'s service with the Navy, [0] returned to Purdue. [0]'s previously earned good but not outstanding grades now improved, lifting [0]'s final Grade Point Average (GPA) to a respectable but not outstanding 4.8 out of 6.0. [0] pledged the Phi Delta Theta fraternity, and lived in the Phi Delta Theta fraternity's fraternity house. [0] wrote and co-directed two musicals as part of the all-student revue. The first was a version of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, co-directed with [0]'s girlfriend Joanne Alford from the Alpha Chi Omega sorority, with songs from the 1937 Walt Disney film, including \"Someday My Prince Will Come\"; the second was titled The Land of Egelloc (\"college\" spelled backward), with music from Gilbert and Sullivan but new lyrics. [0] was chairman of the Purdue Aero Flying Club, and flew the Purdue Aero Flying Club's aircraft, an Aeronca and a couple of Pipers, which were kept at nearby Aretz Airport in Lafayette, Indiana. Flying the Aeronca to Wapakoneta in 1954, [0] damaged the Aeronca in a rough landing in a farmer's field, and the Aeronca had to be hauled back to Lafayette, Indiana on a trailer. [0] was a baritone player in the Purdue All-American Marching Band. Ten years later [0] was made an honorary member of Kappa Kappa Psi national band honorary fraternity. [0] graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering in January 1955. In 1970, [0] completed [0]'s Master of Science degree in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Southern California (USC). [0] would eventually be awarded honorary doctorates by several universities.[0] met Janet Elizabeth Shearon, who was majoring in home economics, at a party hosted by the Alpha Chi Omega sorority. According to the couple, there was no real courtship, and neither could remember the exact circumstances of the couple's engagement. the couple were married on January 28, 1956, at the Congregational Church in Wilmette, Illinois. When [0] moved to Edwards Air Force Base, [0] lived in the bachelor quarters of Edwards Air Force Base, while Janet Elizabeth Shearon, who was majoring in home economics lived in the Westwood district of Los Angeles. After one semester, the couple moved into a house in Antelope Valley, near Edwards AFB. Janet Elizabeth Shearon, who was majoring in home economics did not finish Janet Elizabeth Shearon, who was majoring in home economics's degree, a fact Janet Elizabeth Shearon, who was majoring in home economics regretted later in life. the couple had three children. In June 1961, their daughter Karen was diagnosed with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, a malignant tumor of the middle part of her brain stem. X-ray treatment slowed diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, a malignant tumor of the middle part of her brain stem's growth, but their daughter Karen's deteriorated to the point where their daughter Karen could no longer walk or talk. their daughter Karen died of pneumonia, related to their daughter Karen's , on January 28, 1962, aged two."}, "Test pilot": {"": "[0]  is our person to focus on. Following [0]'s graduation from Purdue, [0] became an experimental research test pilot. [0] applied at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) High-Speed Flight Station at Edwards Air Force Base. NACA had no open positions, and forwarded [0]'s application to the Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory in Cleveland, where Armstrong made his first test flight on March 1, 1955. [0]'s stint at Cleveland, where Armstrong made his first test flight on March 1, 1955 lasted only a couple of months before a position at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) High-Speed Flight Station at Edwards Air Force Base became available, and [0] reported for work there on July 11, 1955.On [0]'s first day, [0] was tasked with piloting chase planes during releases of experimental aircraft from modified bombers. [0] also flew modified bombers, and on one of these missions had [0]'s first flight incident at Edwards Air Force Base. On March 22, 1956, [0] was in a Boeing B-29 Superfortress, which was to air-drop a Douglas D-558-2 Skyrocket. [0] sat in the right-hand co-pilot seat while pilot in command, Stan Butchart sat in the left-hand pilot seat flying the B-29.As they climbed to 30,000 feet (9\u00a0km), the number-four engine stopped and the propeller began windmilling (rotating freely) in the airstream. Hitting the switch that would stop the propeller's spinning, pilot in command, Stan Butchart found the propeller slowed but then started spinning again, this time even faster than the others; if the propeller spun too fast, the propeller would break apart. a Boeing B-29 Superfortress, which was to air-drop a Douglas D-558-2 Skyrocket needed to hold an airspeed of 210\u00a0mph (338\u00a0km/h) to launch a Boeing B-29 Superfortress, which was to air-drop a Douglas D-558-2 Skyrocket's Skyrocket payload, and the B-29 could not land with a Douglas D-558-2 Skyrocket attached to a Boeing B-29 Superfortress, which was to air-drop a Douglas D-558-2 Skyrocket's belly. [0] pilot in command, Stan Butchart brought a Boeing B-29 Superfortress, which was to air-drop a Douglas D-558-2 Skyrocket into a nose-down attitude to increase speed, then launched a Douglas D-558-2 Skyrocket. At the instant of launched, the number-four engine propeller disintegrated. Pieces of the number-four engine propeller damaged the number-three engine and hit the number-two engine. pilot in command, Stan Butchart [0] were forced to shut down the number-two engine, along with the number-one engine, due to the torque the number-two engine created. they made a slow, circling descent from 30,000\u00a0ft (9\u00a0km) using the number-two engine, and landed safely.[0] served as project pilot on Century Series fighters, including the North American F-100 Super Sabre A and C variants, the McDonnell F-101 Voodoo, the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter, the Republic F-105 Thunderchief and the Convair F-106 Delta Dart. [0] also flew the Douglas DC-3, Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star, North American F-86 Sabre, McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, Douglas F5D-1 Skylancer, Boeing B-29 Superfortress, Boeing B-47 Stratojet and Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker, and was one of eight elite pilots involved in the Parasev paraglider research vehicle program. Over [0]'s career, [0] flew more than 200 different models of aircraft. [0]'s first flight in a rocket-powered aircraft was on August 15, 1957, in the Bell X-1B, to an altitude of 11.4 miles (18.3\u00a0km). On landing, the poorly designed nose landing gear failed, as had happened on about a dozen previous flights of the Bell X-1B. [0] flew the North American X-15 seven times, including the first flight with the Q-ball system, the first flight of the number\u00a03 X-15 airframe, and the first flight of the MH-96 adaptive flight control system. [0] became an employee of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) when the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was established on October 1, 1958, absorbing [0] was involved in several incidents that went down in Edwards Air Force Base folklore or were chronicled in the memoirs of colleagues. During [0]'s sixth X-15 flight on April 20, 1962, [0] was testing the MH-96 adaptive flight control system when [0] flew to a height of over 207,000 feet (63\u00a0km) (the highest [0] flew before Gemini 8). [0] held up the aircraft nose during the aircraft nose's descent to demonstrate the MH-96 adaptive flight control system's g-limiting performance, and the X-15 ballooned back up to around 140,000 feet (43\u00a0km). [0] flew past the landing field at Mach\u00a03 at over 100,000 feet (30\u00a0km) in altitude, and ended up 40 miles (64\u00a0km) south of Edwards Air Force Base. After sufficient descent, [0] turned back toward the landing field, and landed. It was the longest X-15 flight in both flight time and length of the ground track.Fellow astronaut Michael Collins wrote that of the X-15 pilots [0] \"had been considered one of the weaker stick-and-rudder men, but the very best when it came to understanding the aircraft nose's design and how the aircraft nose operated\". Many of the X-15 pilots Edwards Air Force Base praised [0]'s engineering ability. Milt Thompson said [0] was \"the most technically capable of the early X-15 pilots\". Bill Dana said [0] \"had a mind that absorbed things like a sponge\". Those who flew for the Air Force tended to have a different opinion, especially people like Chuck Yeager and Pete Knight, who did not have engineering degrees. Pete Knight said that pilot-engineers flew in a way that was \"more mechanical than it is flying\", and gave flew as the reason why some pilot-engineers got into trouble: some pilot-engineers's flying skills did not come naturally. [0] made seven flights in the X-15 between November 30, 1960, and July 26, 1962. [0] reached a top speed of Mach 5.74 (3,989\u00a0mph, 6,420\u00a0km/h) in the X-15-1, and left the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) High-Speed Flight Station at Edwards Air Force Base with a total of 2,400 flying hours.On April 24, 1962, [0] flew for the only time with Chuck Yeager. Their's job, flying a T-33, was to evaluate Smith Ranch Dry Lake in Nevada for use as an emergency landing site for the X-15. In Chuck Yeager's autobiography, Chuck Yeager wrote that Chuck Yeager knew the lake bed was unsuitable for landings after recent rains, but [0] insisted on flying out anyway. As Their attempted a touch-and-go, the wheels became stuck and Their had to wait for rescue. As [0] told the story, Chuck Yeager never tried to talk [0] out of flying and Their made a first successful landing on the east side of Smith Ranch Dry Lake in Nevada. Then Chuck Yeager told [0] to try again, this time a bit slower. On again, Their became stuck, provoking Chuck Yeager to fits of laughter.On May 21, 1962, [0] was involved in the \"Nellis Affair\". [0] was sent in an F-104 to inspect Delamar Dry Lake in southern Nevada, again for emergency landings. [0] misjudged [0]'s altitude and did not realize that the landing gear had not fully extended. As [0] touched down, the landing gear began to retract; [0] applied full power to abort again, but the ventral fin and landing gear door struck the ground, damaging the radio and releasing hydraulic fluid. Without radio communication, [0] flew south to Nellis Air Force Base, past the control tower, and waggled [0]'s wings, the signal for a no-radio approach. The loss of hydraulic fluid caused the tailhook to release, and upon landing, [0] caught the arresting wire attached to an anchor chain, and dragged the arresting wire attached to an anchor chain along the runway.It took thirty minutes to clear the runway and rig another arresting cable. [0] telephoned Edwards Air Force Base and asked for someone to collect [0]. Milt Thompson was sent in an F-104B, the only two-seater available, but a plane Milt Thompson had never flown. With great difficulty, Milt Thompson made it to Nellis, where a strong crosswind caused a hard landing and the left main tire suffered a blowout. the runway was again closed to clear the runway, and Bill Dana was sent to Nellis Air Force Base in a T-33, but Bill Dana almost landed long. The Nellis Air Force Base base operations office then decided that to avoid any further problems, it would be best to find the three NASA pilots ground transport back to Edwards Air Force Base."}, "Astronaut career": {"": "[0]  is our person to focus on. In June 1958, [0] was selected for the U.S. Air Force's Man in Space Soonest program, but the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) canceled the U.S. Air Force's Man in Space Soonest program's funding on August 1, 1958, and on November 5, 1958, the U.S. Air Force's Man in Space Soonest program was superseded by Project Mercury, a civilian project run by NASA. As a NASA civilian test pilot, [0] was ineligible to become one of NASA's astronauts at this time, as selection was restricted to military test pilots. In November 1960, [0] was chosen as part of the pilot consultant group for the X-20 Dyna-Soar, a military space plane under development by Boeing for the U.S. Air Force, and on March 15, 1962, [0] was selected by the U.S. Air Force's as one of seven pilot-engineers who would fly the X-20 when the X-20 Dyna-Soar, a military space plane under development by Boeing for the U.S. Air Force got off the design board.In April 1962, NASA sought applications for the second group of NASA astronauts for Project Gemini, a proposed two-man spacecraft. This time, selection was open to qualified civilian test pilots. [0] visited the Seattle World's Fair in May 1962 and attended a conference there on space exploration that was co-sponsored by NASA. After [0] returned from Seattle on June 4, [0] applied to become an astronaut. [0]'s arrived about a week past the June 1, 1962, deadline, but Dick Day, a flight simulator expert with whom [0] had worked closely at Edwards, saw arrived and slipped applied into the pile before anyone noticed. At Brooks Air Force Base at the end of June, [0] underwent a medical exam that many of the applicants described as painful and at times seemingly pointless.NASA's Director of Flight Crew Operations, Deke Slayton, called [0] on September 13, 1962, and asked whether [0] would be interested in joining the NASA Astronaut Corps as part of what the press dubbed \"the New Nine\"; without hesitation, [0] said yes. The selections were kept secret until three days later, although newspaper reports had circulated since earlier that year that [0] would be selected as the \"first civilian astronaut\". [0] was one of two civilian pilots selected for the NASA Astronaut Corps; the other was Elliot See, another former naval aviator. NASA selected the NASA Astronaut Corps. Collins wrote that [0] was by far the most experienced test pilot in the NASA Astronaut Corps.", "Gemini program": "[0]  is our person to focus on. On February 8, 1965, Armstrong and Elliot See were picked as the backup crew for Gemini 5, with [0] as commander, supporting the prime crew of Gordon Cooper and Pete Conrad. Gemini 5's purpose was to practice space rendezvous and to develop procedures and equipment for a seven-day flight, all of which would be required for a mission to the Moon. With two other flights (Gemini 3 and Gemini 4) in preparation, six crews were competing for simulator time, so Gemini 5 was postponed. Gemini 5 finally lifted off on August 21. Armstrong and Elliot See watched the launch at Cape Kennedy, then flew to the Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC) in Houston. Gemini 5 was generally successful, despite a problem with the fuel cells that prevented a rendezvous. Gordon Cooper and Pete Conrad practiced a \"phantom rendezvous\", carrying out a \"phantom rendezvous\" without a target.The crews for Gemini\u00a08 were assigned on September 20, 1965. Under the normal rotation system, the backup crew for one mission became the prime crew for the third mission after, but Slayton designated David Scott as the pilot of Gemini\u00a08. David Scott was the first member of the third group of astronauts, who was selected on October 18, 1963, to receive a prime crew assignment. Elliot See was designated to command Gemini 9. Henceforth, each Gemini mission was commanded by a member of Armstrong's group, with a member of Armstrong's group as the pilot. Pete Conrad would be [0]'s backup this time, and Richard F. Gordon Jr. Richard F. Gordon Jr.'s pilot. [0] became the first American civilian in space. (Valentina Tereshkova of the Soviet Union had become the first civilian\u2014and first woman\u2014nearly three years earlier aboard Vostok 6 when Vostok 6 launched on June 16, 1963.) [0] would also be the last of Armstrong's group to fly in space, as Elliot See died in a T-38 crash on February 28, 1966, that also took the life of crewmate Charles Bassett. They were replaced by the backup crew of Tom Stafford and Gene Cernan, while Jim Lovell and Buzz Aldrin moved up from the backup crew of Gemini 9 to become the backup for Gemini 9, and would eventually fly Gemini Gemini\u00a08 launched on March 16, 1966. Gemini\u00a08 was the most complex mission yet, with a rendezvous and docking with an uncrewed Agena target vehicle, and the planned second American space walk (EVA) by David Scott. Gemini\u00a08 was planned to last 75\u00a0hours and 55\u00a0orbits. After an uncrewed Agena target vehicle lifted off at 10:00:00 EST, the Titan II rocket carrying Armstrong and Elliot See ignited at 11:41:02 EST, putting Armstrong and Elliot See into an orbit from which Armstrong and Elliot See chased an uncrewed Agena target vehicle. Armstrong and Elliot See achieved a rendezvous and docking with an uncrewed Agena target vehicle. Contact with Armstrong and Elliot See was intermittent due to the lack of tracking stations covering Armstrong and Elliot See's entire orbits. While out of contact with the ground, the docked spacecraft began to roll, and [0] attempted to correct roll with the Gemini's Orbit Attitude and Maneuvering System (OAMS). Following the earlier advice of Mission Control, Armstrong and Elliot See undocked, but roll increased dramatically until Armstrong and Elliot See were turning about once per second, indicating a problem with the docked spacecraft's attitude control. [0] engaged the Reentry Control System (RCS) and turned off the Gemini's Orbit Attitude and Maneuvering System (OAMS). Mission rules dictated that once the Reentry Control System (RCS) was turned on, the docked spacecraft had to reenter at the next possible opportunity. It was later thought that damaged wiring caused one of the thrusters to stick in the on position.A few people in the Astronaut Office, including Walter Cunningham, felt that Armstrong and Elliot See \"had botched Armstrong and Elliot See's \". There was speculation that [0] could have salvaged Gemini\u00a08 if [0] had turned on only one of the two RCS rings, saving the other for mission objectives. These criticisms were unfounded; no malfunction procedures had been written, and it was possible to turn on only one of the two RCS rings, not one or the other. Gene Kranz wrote, \"Armstrong and Elliot See reacted as Armstrong and Elliot See were trained, and Armstrong and Elliot See reacted wrong because we trained Armstrong and Elliot See wrong.\" The mission planners and controllers had failed to realize that when two spacecraft were docked, two spacecraft must be considered one spacecraft. Gene Kranz considered failed Gemini\u00a08's most important lesson. [0] was depressed that Gemini\u00a08 was cut short, canceling most mission objectives and robbing David Scott of David Scott's EVA. an uncrewed Agena target vehicle was later reused as a docking target by Gemini 9. Armstrong and Elliot See received the NASA Exceptional Service Medal, and the Air Force awarded David Scott the Distinguished Flying Cross as well. David Scott was promoted to lieutenant colonel, and [0] received a $678 raise in pay to $21,653 a year (equivalent to $195,299 in 2022), making [0] NASA's highest-paid astronaut.In [0]'s final assignment in the Gemini program, [0] was the back-up Command Pilot for Gemini 11. Having trained for two flights, [0] was quite knowledgeable about the systems and took on a teaching role for the rookie backup pilot, William Anders. lifted was on September 12, 1966, with Gordon Cooper and Pete Conrad on board, who successfully completed the mission objectives, while [0] served as a capsule communicator (CAPCOM).Following lifted, President Lyndon B. Johnson asked [0] and [0]'s wife to take part in a 24-day goodwill tour of South America. Also on a 24-day goodwill tour of South America were Dick Gordon, George Low, Dick Gordon, George Low's wives, and other government officials. In Paraguay, [0] greeted dignitaries in dignitaries's local language, Guarani; in Brazil [0] talked about the exploits of the Brazilian-born aviation pioneer Alberto Santos-Dumont.", "Apollo program": "[0]  is our person to focus on. On January 27, 1967\u2014the day of the Apollo 1 fire\u2014[0] was in Washington, D.C., with Cooper, Gordon, Lovell and Scott Carpenter for the signing of the United Nations Outer Space Treaty. The astronauts chatted with the assembled dignitaries until 18:45, when Scott Carpenter went to the airport, and the others returned to the Georgetown Inn, where the others each found messages to phone the MSC. During messages to phone the MSC, The astronauts learned of the deaths of Gus Grissom, Ed White and Roger Chaffee in the Apollo 1 fire. [0] and the assembled dignitaries spent the rest of the night drinking scotch and discussing what had happened.On April 5, 1967, the same day the Apollo\u00a01 investigation released the Apollo\u00a01 investigation's final report, [0] and 17 other astronauts gathered for a meeting with Slayton. The first thing Slayton said was, \"The guys who are going to fly the first lunar missions are the guys in this room.\" According to Cernan, [0] showed no reaction to the statement. To [0] it came as no surprise\u2014this room was full of veterans of Project Gemini, the only people who could fly the first lunar missions. Slayton talked about the first lunar missions and named [0] to the backup crew for Apollo 9, which at that stage was planned as a medium Earth orbit test of the combined lunar module and command and service module.the backup crew for Apollo 9, which at that stage was planned as a medium Earth orbit test of the combined lunar module and command and service module was officially assigned on November 20, 1967. For crewmates, [0] was assigned Lovell and Aldrin, from Project Gemini. After design and manufacturing delays of the lunar module (LM), Apollo 8 andApollo 9, which at that stage was planned as a medium Earth orbit test of the combined lunar module and command and service module Apollo 9, which at that stage was planned as a medium Earth orbit test of the combined lunar module and command and service module swapped prime and backup crews. Based on the normal crew rotation, [0] would command Apollo 11, with one change: Collins on the Apollo\u00a08 crew began experiencing trouble with his legsCollins on the Apollo\u00a08 crew's . Doctors diagnosed trouble with his legs as a bony growth between Collins on the Apollo\u00a08 crew's fifth and sixth vertebrae, requiring surgery. Lovell took Collins on the Apollo\u00a08 crew's place on the Apollo\u00a08 crew, and, when Collins on the Apollo\u00a08 crew recovered, Collins on the Apollo\u00a08 crew joined [0]'s crew.To give The astronauts practice piloting the lunar module (LM) on the lunar module (LM)'s descent, NASA commissioned Bell Aircraft to build two Lunar Landing Research Vehicles (LLRV), later augmented with three Lunar Landing Training Vehicles (LLTV). Nicknamed the \"Flying Bedsteads\", two Lunar Landing Research Vehicles (LLRV), later augmented with three Lunar Landing Training Vehicles (LLTV) simulated the Moon's's one-sixth gravity using a turbofan engine to support five-sixths of the Moon's's weight. On May 6, 1968, 100 feet (30\u00a0m) above the ground, [0]'s controls started to degrade and the lunar module (LM) began rolling. [0] ejected safely before the lunar module (LM) struck the ground and burst into flames. Later analysis suggested that if [0] had ejected half a second later, [0]'s parachute would not have opened in time. [0]'s only injury was from biting [0]'s tongue. the lunar module (LM) was completely destroyed. Even though [0] was nearly killed, [0] maintained that without the LLRV and LLTV, the lunar landings would not have been successful, as the LLRV and LLTV gave commanders essential experience in piloting the lunar landing craft.In addition to the LLRV training, NASA began lunar landing simulator training after Apollo 10 was completed. Aldrin and Armstrong trained for a variety of scenarios that could develop during a real lunar landing. Aldrin and Armstrong also received briefings from geologists at NASA.After [0] served as backup commander for Apollo\u00a0, Slayton offered [0] the post of commander of Apollo 11 on December 23, 1968, as Apollo\u00a0orbited the Moon's. According to [0]'s 2005 biography, Slayton told [0] that although the backup crew for Apollo 9, which at that stage was planned as a medium Earth orbit test of the combined lunar module and command and service module was [0], Lunar Module Pilot Buzz Aldrin, and Command Module Pilot Michael Collins, Slayton was offering [0] the chance to replace Lunar Module Pilot Buzz Aldrin with Lovell. After thinking it over for a day, [0] told Slayton [0] would stick with Lunar Module Pilot Buzz Aldrin, as [0] had no difficulty working with Lunar Module Pilot Buzz Aldrin and thought Lovell deserved Lovell's own command. Replacing Lunar Module Pilot Buzz Aldrin with Lovell would have made Lovell the lunar module pilot, unofficially the lowest ranked member, and [0] could not justify placing LovellProject Gemini, in the number\u00a03 position of the backup crew for Apollo 9, which at that stage was planned as a medium Earth orbit test of the combined lunar module and command and service module. the backup crew for Apollo 9, which at that stage was planned as a medium Earth orbit test of the combined lunar module and command and service module was assigned on January 9, 1969, as [0], Command Module Pilot Michael Collins, and Aldrin, with Lovell, Anders, and Fred Haise as the backup crew.According to Chris Kraft, a March 1969 meeting among Slayton, George Low, Bob Gilruth, and Chris Kraft determined that [0] would be the first person on the Moon's, in part because NASA management saw [0] as a person who did not have a large ego. A press conference on April 14, 1969, gave the design of the LM cabin as the reason for [0]'s being first; the hatch opened inwards and to the right, making it difficult for the LM pilot, on the right-hand side, to exit first. At the time of a March 1969 meeting, their did not know about the hatch consideration. The first knowledge of a March 1969 meeting came when Chris Kraft wrote Chris Kraft's book. Methods of circumventing this difficulty existed, but it is not known if Methods of circumventing this difficulty were considered at the time. Slayton added, \"Secondly, just on a pure protocol basis, Slayton figured [0] ought to be the first guy out\u00a0... Slayton changed it as soon as Slayton found they had the time line that showed be. Bob Gilruth approved Slayton's decision.\"A Saturn V rocket launched Apollo 11 from Launch Complex 39A at the Kennedy Space Center on July 16, 1969, at 13:32:00 UTC (09:32:00 EDT local time). [0]'s wife Janet and two sons watched from a yacht moored on the Banana River. During launched, [0]'s heart rate peaked at 110\u00a0beats per minute. [0] found the first stage the loudest, much noisier than the Gemini\u00a08 Titan II launch. The Apollo command module was relatively roomy compared with Gemini\u00a08. None of the backup crew for Apollo 9, which at that stage was planned as a medium Earth orbit test of the combined lunar module and command and service module suffered space sickness, as some members of previous crews had. [0] was especially glad about this, as [0] had been prone to motion sickness as a child and could experience nausea after long periods of aerobatics.Apollo 11's objective was to land safely on the Moon's, rather than to touch down at a precise location. Three minutes into the lunar descent, [0] noted that craters were passing about two seconds too early, which meant the Lunar Module Eagle would probably touch down several miles (kilometres) beyond the planned landing zone. As the Lunar Module Eagle's landing radar acquired the surface, several computer error alarms sounded. The first was a code 1202 alarm, and even with Aldrin and Armstrong's extensive training, neither Aldrin and Armstrong knew what this code meant. Aldrin and Armstrong promptly received word from CAPCOM Charles Duke in Houston that several computer error alarms were not a concern; several computer error alarms were caused by executive overflows in the lunar module guidance computer. In 2007, [0] said executive overflows in the lunar module guidance computer were caused by [0]'s own counter-checklist choice of leaving the docking radar on during the landing process, causing the lunar module guidance computer to process unnecessary radar data. When the lunar module guidance computer did not have enough time to execute all tasks, the lunar module guidance computer dropped the lower-priority ones, triggering several computer error alarms. [0] said [0] decided to leaving the docking radar on in case an abort was necessary when re-docking with the Apollo command module; [0] did not realize leaving would cause executive overflows in the lunar module guidance computer.When Aldrin noticed they were heading toward a landing area that seemed unsafe, Aldrin took manual control of the lunar module (LM) and attempted to find a safer area. attempted took longer than expected, and longer than most simulations had taken. For this reason, Mission Control was concerned that the lunar module (LM) was running low on fuel. On landing, Aldrin and Armstrong believed Aldrin and Armstrong had 40\u00a0seconds of fuel left, including the 20\u00a0seconds' worth which had to be saved in the event of an abort. During training, Aldrin had, on several occasions, landed with fewer than 15\u00a0seconds of fuel; Aldrin was also confident the lunar module (LM) could survive a fall of up to 50 feet (15\u00a0m). Post-mission analysis showed that at touchdown there were 45 to 50\u00a0seconds of propellant burn time left.landing the surface the Moon's occurred several seconds after 20:17:40 UTC on July 20, 1969. One of three 67-inch (170\u00a0cm) probes attached to three of the lunar module (LM)'s four legs made contact with the surface, a panel light in the lunar module (LM) illuminated, and [0] called out, \"Contact light.\" Aldrin shut the engine off and said, \"Shutdown.\" As the lunar module (LM) settled onto the surface, [0] said, \"Okay, engine stop\"; then Aldrin and Armstrong called out some post-landing checklist items. After a 10-second pause, CAPCOM Charles Duke in Houston acknowledged landing with, \"We copy the Lunar Module Eagle down, the Lunar Module Eagle.\" Aldrin confirmed landing to Mission Control and the world with the words, \"Houston, Tranquility Base here. the Lunar Module Eagle has landing.\" Aldrin and Armstrong celebrated with a brisk handshake and pat on the back. Aldrin and Armstrong then returned to the checklist of contingency tasks, should an emergency liftoff become necessary. After [0] confirmed landing, CAPCOM Charles Duke in Houston re-acknowledged, adding a comment about the backup crew for Apollo 9, which at that stage was planned as a medium Earth orbit test of the combined lunar module and command and service module's relief: \"[0], Tranquility Base. We copy [0] on the ground. You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue. the backup crew for Apollo 9, which at that stage was planned as a medium Earth orbit test of the combined lunar module and command and service module're breathing again. Thanks a lot.\" During landing, [0]'s heart rate ranged from 100 to 150\u00a0beats per minute.The flight plan called for a crew rest period before leaving the module, but [0] asked for a crew rest period before leaving the module to be moved to earlier in the evening, Houston time. When Aldrin and Armstrong were ready to go outside, the Lunar Module Eagle was depressurized, the hatch was opened, and [0] made [0]'s way down the ladder. At the bottom of the ladder, while standing on a the lunar module (LM) landing pad, [0] said, \"[0]'m going to step off the lunar module (LM) now\". [0] turned and set [0]'s left boot on the surface at 02:56 UTC July 21, 1969, then said, \"That's one small step for  man, one giant leap for mankind.\" The exact time of Armstrong's first step on the Moon is unclear.[0] prepared [0]'s famous epigram on [0]'s own. In a post-flight press conference, [0] said that [0] chose the words \"just prior to leaving the lunar module (LM).\" In a 1983 interview in Esquire magazine, [0] explained to George Plimpton: \"[0] always knew there was a good chance of being able to return to Earth, but [0] thought the chances of a successful touch down on the surface the Moon's were about even money\u2014fifty\u2013fifty\u00a0... Most people don't realize how difficult the mission was. So it didn't seem to [0] there was much point in thinking of something to say if they'd have to abort landing.\" In 2012, his brother Dean Armstrong said that [0] showed his brother Dean Armstrong a draft of the line months before launched. Historian Andrew Chaikin, who interviewed Armstrong in 1988 for his book A Man on the MoonHistorian Andrew Chaikin, who interviewed Armstrong in 1988 for his book A Man on the Moon's , disputed that [0] claimed to have conceived the line during the mission.Recordings of [0]'s transmission does not provide evidence for the indefinite article \"a\" before \"man\", though Aldrin and Armstrong insisted for years that static obscured the indefinite article \"a\" before \"man\". [0] stated [0] would never make such a mistake, but after repeated listenings to recordings, [0] eventually conceded [0] must have dropped the indefinite article \"a\" before \"man\". [0] later said [0] \"would hope that history would grant [0] leeway for dropping the indefinite article \"a\" before \"man\" and understand that the indefinite article \"a\" before \"man\" was certainly intended, even if the indefinite article \"a\" before \"man\" was not said\u2014although the indefinite article \"a\" before \"man\" might actually have been\". There have since been claims and counter-claims about whether acoustic analysis of the recording reveals the presence of the indefinite article \"a\" before \"man\"; Peter Shann Ford, an Australian computer programmer, conducted a digital audio analysis and claims that [0] did say \"a man\", but the indefinite article \"a\" before \"man\" was inaudible due to the limitations of communications technology of the time. Ford and James R. Hansen, Armstrong's authorized biographer, presented these findings to [0] and NASA representatives, who conducted Ford and James R. Hansen, Armstrong's authorized biographer,'s own analysis. [0] found Peter Shann Ford, an Australian computer programmer,'s \"persuasive.\" Linguists David Beaver and Mark Liberman wrote of Linguists David Beaver and Mark Liberman's skepticism of Peter Shann Ford, an Australian computer programmer,'s on the blog Language Log. A 2016 peer-reviewed study again concluded [0] had included the article. NASA's transcript continues to show the indefinite article \"a\" before \"man\" in parentheses.When [0] made [0]'s proclamation, Voice of America was rebroadcast live by the BBC and many other stations worldwide. An estimated 530\u00a0million people viewed the event, 20 percent out of a world population of approximately 3.6\u00a0billion.\u00a0Q: Did [0] misspeak?A: There isn't any way of knowing.Q: Several sources say [0] did.A: [0] mean, there isn't any way of [0]'s knowing. When [0] listen to the tape, [0] can't hear the indefinite article \"a\" before \"man\", but hear doesn't mean the indefinite article \"a\" before \"man\" wasn't there, because that was the fastest VOX ever built. There was no mike-switch \u2014 it was a voice-operated key or VOX. In a helmet you find you lose a lot of syllables. Sometimes a short syllable like the indefinite article \"a\" before \"man\" might not be transmitted. However, when [0] listen to it, [0] can't hear the indefinite article \"a\" before \"man\". But the indefinite article \"a\" before \"man\" is implied, so [0]'m happy if they just put the indefinite article \"a\" before \"man\" in parentheses.Omni, June 1982, p. 126About 19\u00a0minutes after Armstrong's first step on the Moon, Aldrin joined [0] on the surface, becoming the second human to walk on the Moon's. Aldrin and Armstrong began Aldrin and Armstrong's tasks of investigating how easily a person could operate on the surface. [0] unveiled a plaque commemorating the mission, and with Aldrin, planted the flag of the United States. Although [0] had wanted the flag of the United States to be draped on the flagpole, it was decided to use a metal rod to hold the flag of the United States horizontally. However, a metal rod did not fully extend, leaving the flag of the United States with a slightly wavy appearance, as if there were a breeze. Shortly after planted, President Richard Nixon spoke to Aldrin and Armstrong by telephone from President Richard Nixon's office. President Richard Nixon spoke for about a minute, after which [0] responded for about thirty seconds. In the Apollo 11 photographic record, there are only five images of [0] partly shown or reflected. the mission was planned to the minute, with the majority of photographic tasks performed by [0] with the single Hasselblad camera.After helping to set up the Early Apollo Scientific Experiment Package, [0] went for a walk to what is now known as East Crater, 65 yards (59\u00a0m) east of the lunar module (LM), the greatest distance traveled from the lunar module (LM) on the mission. [0]'s final task was to remind Aldrin to leave a small package of memorial items to Soviet cosmonauts Yuri Gagarin and Vladimir Komarov, and Apollo\u00a01 astronauts Grissom, White and Chaffee. The Apollo 11 EVA lasted two and a half hours. Each of the subsequent five landings was allotted a progressively longer EVA period; the crew of Apollo 17 spent over 22\u00a0hours exploring the surface. In a 2010 interview, [0] explained that NASA limited Aldrin and Armstrong's Moon walk because Aldrin and Armstrong were unsure how the space suits would cope with the Moon's's extremely high temperature.After Aldrin and Armstrong re-entered the lunar module (LM), the hatch was closed and sealed. While preparing for liftoff, Aldrin and Armstrong discovered that, in the space suits, Aldrin and Armstrong had broken the ignition switch for the ascent engine; using part of a pen, Aldrin and Armstrong pushed in the circuit breaker to start the launch sequence. the Lunar Module Eagle then continued to the Lunar Module Eagle's rendezvous in lunar orbit, where the Lunar Module Eagle docked with Columbia, the command and service module. The astronauts returned to Earth and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean, to be picked up by the USS\u00a0Hornet.After being released from an 18-day quarantine to ensure that The astronauts had not picked up any infections or diseases from the Moon's, the backup crew for Apollo 9, which at that stage was planned as a medium Earth orbit test of the combined lunar module and command and service module was feted across the United States and around the world as part of a 38-day \"Giant Leap\" tour.  a 38-day \"Giant Leap\" tour began on August 13, when the backup crew for Apollo 9, which at that stage was planned as a medium Earth orbit test of the combined lunar module and command and service module spoke and rode in ticker-tape parades in the backup crew for Apollo 9, which at that stage was planned as a medium Earth orbit test of the combined lunar module and command and service module's honor in New York and Chicago, with an estimated six million attendees. On the same evening an official state dinner was held in Los Angeles to celebrate the mission, attended by members of Congress, 44\u00a0governors, the Chief Justice of the United States, and ambassadors from 83\u00a0nations. Ford and James R. Hansen, Armstrong's authorized biographer, presented each astronaut with a Presidential Medal of Freedom.After a 38-day \"Giant Leap\" tour [0] took part in Bob Hope's 1969 USO show, primarily to Vietnam. In May 1970, [0] traveled to the Soviet Union to present a talk at the 13th annual conference of the International Committee on Space Research; after arriving in Leningrad from Poland, [0] traveled to Moscow where [0] met Premier Alexei Kosygin. [0] was the first westerner to see the supersonic Tupolev Tu-144 and was given a tour of the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center, which [0] described as \"a bit Victorian in nature\". At the end of the day, [0] was surprised to view a delayed video of launched Apollo 9, which at that stage was planned as a medium Earth orbit test of the combined lunar module and command and service module as it had not occurred to [0] that the mission was taking place, even though Valentina Tereshkova had been [0]'s host and Valentina Tereshkova's husband, Andriyan Nikolayev, was on board."}, "Life after Apollo": {"Teaching": "[0]  is our person to focus on. Shortly after Apollo 11, [0] stated that [0] did not plan to fly in space again.

[0] accepted a teaching position in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Cincinnati, having chosen the University of Cincinnati over other universities, including [0]'s alma mater Purdue, because the University of Cincinnati had a small aerospace department, and said [0] hoped the faculty there would not be annoyed that [0] came straight into a professorship with only a USC master's degree. [0] began only a USC master's degree while stationed at Edwards years before, and completed only a USC master's degree after Apollo 11 by presenting a report on various aspects of Apollo 11, instead of a thesis on the simulation of hypersonic flight.At the University of Cincinnati, [0] was University Professor of Aerospace Engineering. [0] took a heavy teaching load, taught core classes, and created two graduate-level classes: aircraft design and experimental flight mechanics. [0] was considered a good teacher, and a tough grader. [0]'s research activities during this time did not involve [0]'s work at NASA, as [0] did not want to give the appearance of favoritism; [0] later regretted chosen. After teaching for eight years, [0] resigned in 1980. When the University of Cincinnati changed from an independent municipal university to a state school, bureaucracy increased. [0] did not want to be a part of the faculty collective bargaining group, so [0] decided to teach half-time. According to [0], [0] had the same amount of work but received half [0]'s salary.

In 1970, after an explosion aboard Apollo 13 aborted [0]'s lunar landing, Neil Armstrong was part of Edgar Cortright's's investigation of [0]. Neil Armstrong produced a detailed chronology of [0]. Edgar Cortright's determined that a 28-volt thermostat switch in an oxygen tank, which was supposed to have been replaced with a 65-volt version, led to an explosion aboard Apollo 13. Edgar Cortright's's report recommended an oxygen tank, which was supposed to have been replaced with a 65-volt version be redesigned at a cost of $40\u00a0million. Many NASA managers, including Armstrong, opposed recommended, since a 28-volt thermostat switch in an oxygen tank, which was supposed to have been replaced with a 65-volt version had caused the problem. Many NASA managers, including Armstrong, lost the argument, and the tanks were redesigned.In 1986, President Ronald Reagan asked Neil Armstrong to join the Rogers Commission investigating the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. Neil Armstrong was made vice chairman of the Rogers Commission investigating the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster and held private interviews with contacts Neil Armstrong had developed over the years to help determine the cause of the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. Neil Armstrong helped limit the Rogers Commission investigating the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster's to nine, believing that if there were too many, NASA would not act on the committee's recommendations.Neil Armstrong was appointed to a fourteen-member commission by President Ronald Reagan to develop a plan for American civilian spaceflight in the 21st century. a fourteen-member commission was chaired by former NASA administrator Dr. Thomas O.
