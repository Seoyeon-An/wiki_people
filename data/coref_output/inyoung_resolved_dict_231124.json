{"Rosalind Franklin": " [0] (25 July 1920\u00a0\u2013 16 April 1958) was a British chemist and X-ray crystallographer whose work was central to the understanding of the molecular structures of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), RNA (ribonucleic acid), viruses, coal, and graphite. Although [0] works on coal and viruses were appreciated in [0]'s lifetime, [0]'s contributions to the discovery of the structure of DNA were largely unrecognized during [0]'s life, for which [0] has been variously referred to as the \"wronged heroine\", the \"dark lady of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid)\", the \"forgotten heroine\", a \"feminist icon\", and the \"Sylvia Plath of molecular biology\".[0] graduated in 1941 with a degree in natural sciences from Newnham College, Cambridge, and then enrolled for a PhD in physical chemistry under Ronald George Wreyford Norrish, the 1920 Chair of Physical Chemistry at the University of Cambridge. Disappointed by Ronald George Wreyford Norrish, the 1920 Chair of Physical Chemistry at the University of Cambridge's lack of enthusiasm, [0] took up a research position under the British Coal Utilisation Research Association (BCURA) in 1942. The research on coal helped [0] earn a PhD from Cambridge in 1945. Moving to Paris in 1947 as a chercheur (postdoctoral researcher) under Jacques Mering at the Laboratoire Central des Services Chimiques de l'\u00c9tat, [0] became an accomplished X-ray crystallographer. After joining King's College London in 1951 as a research associate, [0] discovered some key properties of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), which eventually facilitated the correct description of the double helix structure of DNA. Owing to disagreement with [0]'s director, John Randall, and [0]'s colleague Maurice Wilkins, [0] was compelled to move to Birkbeck College in 1953.In April 2023, Matthew Cobb and Nathaniel Comfort suggested new evidence in an opinion piece that [0] was a contributor and \"equal player\" in process leading to the discovery of the structure of DNA, rather than otherwise, as may have been presented subsequently after the time of the discovery of the structure of DNA. A musical, titled \"Double Helix\", based on [0]'s contribution to the discovery of the structure of DNA opened the following month at the Bay Street Theater in Sag Harbor, [0] is best known for [0]'s work on the X-ray diffraction images of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) while at King's College London, particularly Photo 51, taken by [0]'s student Raymond Gosling, which led to the discovery of the double helix structure of DNA for which Francis Crick, James Watson, and Maurice Wilkins shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1962. James Watson suggested that [0] would have ideally been awarded a Nobel Prize in Chemistry, along with Maurice Wilkins but, although there was not yet a rule against posthumous awards, the Nobel Committee generally did not make posthumous nominations.Working under John Desmond Bernal, [0] led pioneering work at Birkbeck College on the molecular structures of viruses. On the day before [0] was to unveil the structure of tobacco mosaic virus at an international fair in Brussels, [0] died of ovarian cancer at the age of 37 in 1958.

One of the most influential artists of the 20th century, [0] is known for co-founding the Cubist movement, the invention of constructed sculpture, the co-invention of collage, and for the wide variety of styles that [0] helped develop and explore. Among [0]'s most famous works are the proto-Cubist Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907) and the anti-war painting Guernica (1937), a dramatic portrayal of the bombing of Guernica by German and Italian air forces during the Spanish Civil War.[0] demonstrated extraordinary artistic talent in [0]'s early years, painting in a naturalistic manner through [0]'s childhood and adolescence. During the first decade of the 20th century, [0]'s style changed as [0] experimented with different theories, techniques, and ideas. After 1906, the Fauvist work of the older artist Henri Matisse motivated [0] to explore more radical styles, beginning a fruitful rivalry between the two artists, who subsequently were often paired by critics as the leaders of modern art.[0]'s output, especially in [0]'s early career, is often periodized. While the names of many of [0]'s later periods are debated, the most commonly accepted periods in [0]'s work are the Blue Period (1901\u20131904), the Rose Period (1904\u20131906), the African-influenced Period (1907\u20131909), Analytic Cubism (1909\u20131912), and Synthetic Cubism (1912\u20131919), also referred to as the Crystal period. Much of [0]'s work of the late 1910s and early 1920s is in a neoclassical style, and [0]'s work in the mid-1920s often has characteristics of Surrealism. [0]'s later work often combines elements of [0]'s earlier styles.Exceptionally prolific throughout the course of his adult life, [0] achieved universal renown and immense fortune for [0]'s revolutionary artistic accomplishments, and became one of the best-known figures in 20th-century art.", "Salvador Dali": " [0] (11 May 1904\u00a0\u2013 23 January 1989), known as Salvador Dal\u00ed (/\u02c8d\u0251\u02d0li, d\u0251\u02d0\u02c8li\u02d0/ DAH-lee, dah-LEE, Catalan: [s\u0259l\u03b2\u0259\u02c8\u00f0o \u00f0\u0259\u02c8li], Spanish: [sal\u03b2a\u02c8\u00f0o\u027e \u00f0a\u02c8li]), was a Spanish surrealist artist renowned for [0]'s technical skill, precise draftsmanship, and the striking and bizarre images in [0]'s work.Born in Figueres, Catalonia, Spain, [0] received [0]'s formal education in fine arts in Madrid. Influenced by Impressionism and the Renaissance masters from a young age [0] became increasingly attracted to Cubism and avant-garde movements. [0] moved closer to Surrealism in the late 1920s and joined the Surrealist group in 1929, soon becoming one of the Surrealist group's leading exponents. [0]'s best-known work, The Persistence of Memory, was completed in August 1931, and is one of the most famous Surrealist paintings. [0] lived in France throughout the Spanish Civil War (1936 to 1939) before leaving for the United States in 1940 where [0] achieved commercial success.

[0] also wrote fiction, poetry, autobiography, essays and criticism. Major themes in [0]'s work include dreams, the subconscious, sexuality, religion, science and [0]'s closest personal relationships. To the dismay of those who held [0]'s work in high regard, and to the irritation of [0]'s critics, [0]'s eccentric and ostentatious public behavior often drew more attention than [0]'s artwork. [0]'s public support for the Francoist regime, [0]'s commercial activities and the quality and authenticity of some of [0]'s late works have also been controversial. [0]'s life and work were an important influence on other Surrealists, pop art and contemporary artists such as Jeff Koons and Damien Hirst.There are two major museums devoted to [0]'s [0]'s work: the Dal\u00ed Theatre-Museum in Figueres, Catalonia, Spain, and the Salvador Dal\u00ed Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida.", "Coco Chanel ": " [0] (/\u0283\u0259\u02c8n\u025bl/ sh\u0259-NEL, French: [\u0261ab\u0281ij\u025bl b\u0254n\u0153\u0281 k\u0254ko \u0283an\u025bl] \u24d8; 19 August 1883 \u2013 10 January 1971) was a French fashion designer and businesswoman.

His 1893 work, The Scream, has become one of Western art's most acclaimed images.[0]'s childhood was overshadowed by illness, bereavement and the dread of inheriting a mental condition that ran in the family.

In Berlin, [0] met the Swedish dramatist August Strindberg, whom [0] painted, as [0] embarked on a major series of paintings [0] would later call The Frieze of Life, depicting a series of deeply-felt themes such as love, anxiety, jealousy and betrayal, steeped in atmosphere.His 1893 work, The Scream, was conceived in Kristiania. According to [0], [0] was out walking at sunset, when [0] 'heard His 1893 work, The Scream,'. His 1893 work, The Scream,'s agonized face is widely identified with the angst of the modern person. Between 1893 and 1910, [0] made two painted versions and two in pastels, as well as a number of prints. One of two in pastels would eventually command the fourth highest nominal price paid for a painting at auction.As [0]'s fame and wealth grew, [0]'s emotional state remained insecure.

[0] fought in World War II as part of the new United States Tank Corps of the American Expeditionary Forces: [0] commanded the U.S. tank school in France, then led tanks into combat and was wounded near the end of World War II. In the interwar period, [0] became a central figure in the development of the United States Army's armored warfare doctrine, serving in numerous staff positions throughout the United States'. At the United States''s entry into World War II, [0] commanded the 2nd Armored Division.[0] led U.S. troops into the Mediterranean Theater of World War II with an invasion of Casablanca during Operation Torch in 1942, and soon established [0] as an effective commander by rapidly rehabilitating the demoralized II Corps.
