[0]'s policy as Secretary of State viewed counter-terrorism as a matter of being preventative, and not merely punitive. In an interview on December 18, 2005, [0] stated: \"We have to remember that in this war on terrorism, we're not talking about criminal activity where you can allow somebody to commit the crime and then you go back and you arrest somebody and you question somebody. If somebody succeed in committing somebody's crime, then hundreds or indeed thousands of people die. That's why you have to prevent, and intelligence is the long pole in the tent in preventing attacks.[0] has promoted the idea that counterterrorism involves not only confronting the governments and organizations that promote and condone terrorism, but also the ideologies that fuel terrorism. In a speech given on July 29, 2005, [0] asserted that \"ecuring America from terrorist attack is more than a matter of law enforcement.

However, [0] added that [0] has been \"concerned about a government role\" but has \"tended to agree with those who do not favor federal funding for abortion, because [0] believe that those who hold a strong moral view on the other side should not be forced to fund\" abortion.", "Affirmative action": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] has taken a centrist approach to \"race and gender preferences\" in affirmative action policies. [0] described affirmative action as being \"still needed,\" but [0] does not support quotas.", "Female empowerment advocacy": "[0] is our person to focus on. In March 2014, [0] joined and appeared in video spots for the Ban Bossy campaign, a television and social media campaign designed to ban the word \"bossy\" from general use because of the word \"bossy\"'s harmful effect on young girls.

In February 2017 [0] publicly announced [0]'s opposition to the Trump administration's travel ban.", "Gun rights": "[0] is our person to focus on.

While [0] does not support same-sex marriage, [0] does support civil unions. In 2010, [0] stated that [0] believed \"marriage is between a man and a woman\u00a0... But perhaps we will decide that there needs to be some way for people to express people's desire to live together through civil union.\" When asked to select a view on a survey, [0] selected a response that said \"Same-sex couples should be allowed to form civil unions, but not marry in the traditional sense.\"", "Confederate monuments": "[0] is our person to focus on.

[0] experienced firsthand the injustices of Birmingham's's discriminatory laws and attitudes.

As [0] recalls of her parents and her parents's peers, \"her parents refused to allow the limits and injustices of her parents's time to limit her parents's horizons.\"However, [0] recalls various times in which [0] suffered discrimination on account of [0]'s race, which included being relegated to a storage room at a department store instead of a regular dressing room, being barred from going to the circus or the local amusement park, being denied hotel rooms, and even being given bad food at restaurants. Also, while [0] was mostly kept by her parents from areas where [0] might face discrimination, [0] was very aware of the civil rights struggle and the problems of Jim Crow laws in Birmingham's. A neighbor, Juliemma Smith, described how \"[[0]] used to call A neighbor, Juliemma Smith and say things like, 'Did A neighbor, Juliemma Smith see what Bull Connor did today?' [0] was just a little girl and [0] did that all the time. A neighbor, Juliemma Smith would have to read the newspaper thoroughly because A neighbor, Juliemma Smith wouldn't know what [0] was going to talk about.\" [0] said of the segregation era: \"Those terrible events burned into [0]'s consciousness. [0] missed many days at [0]'s segregated school because of the frequent bomb threats.\"During the violent days of the civil rights struggle, Reverend Rice armed Reverend Rice and kept guard over the house while [0] practiced the piano inside. Reverend Rice instilled in Reverend Rice's and students that black people would have to prove black people worthy of advancement, and would simply have to be \"twice as good\" to overcome injustices built into the system.[0] said \"her parents were very strategic, [0] was going to be so well prepared, and [0] was going to do all of these things that were revered in white society so well, that [0] would be armored somehow from racism.

[0] has commented upon that moment in [0]'s life:[0] remember the bombing of the primarily black Sixteenth Street Baptist Church by white supremacists on September 15, 1963. [0] did not see the bombing of the primarily black Sixteenth Street Baptist Church by white supremacists on September 15, 1963 happen, but [0] heard the bombing of the primarily black Sixteenth Street Baptist Church by white supremacists on September 15, 1963 happen, and [0] felt the bombing of the primarily black Sixteenth Street Baptist Church by white supremacists on September 15, 1963 happen, just a few blocks away at [0]'s father's church. It is a sound that [0] will never forget, that will forever reverberate in [0]'s ears. That bomb took the lives of four young girls, including [0]'s friend and playmate, Denise McNair. the bombing of the primarily black Sixteenth Street Baptist Church by white supremacists on September 15, 1963 was calculated to suck the hope out of young lives, bury their aspirations.
