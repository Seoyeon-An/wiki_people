[0] is one of three Formula One drivers from Brazil to win the Formula One World Drivers' Championship and won 41 Grands Prix and 65 pole positions, with 65 pole positions being the record until 2006. [0] died in an accident while leading the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix, driving for the Williams team.[0] began [0]'s motorsport career in karting, moved up to open-wheel racing in 1981 and won the 1983 British Formula Three Championship. [0] made [0]'s Formula One debut with Toleman-Hart in 1984, before moving to Lotus-Renault the following year and winning six Grands Prix over the next three seasons.

[0] was born at 2:35\u00a0a.m. (05:35 GMT) on Monday, 21 March 1960, in the Pro-Matre Maternity Hospital of Santana, a neighbourhood of S\u00e3o Paulo. The middle child of a wealthy Brazilian family, [0] was born to landowner and factory owner Milton Guirado da Silva and his wife Neide Senna da Silva; [0] had an older sister, Viviane, and a younger brother, Leonardo. [0] was left-handed.[better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] his wife Neide Senna da Silva was the granddaughter of Italian immigrants, while landowner and factory owner Milton Guirado da Silva was born to a Spanish mother (from T\u00edjola, Province of Almer\u00eda) and a Brazilian father from S\u00e3o Paulo.The house where Senna spent the first four years of his life belonged to his wife Neide Senna da Silva's father, Jo\u00e3o Senna. The house where Senna spent the first four years of his life was located on the corner of Avenida Aviador Guilherme with Avenida Gil Santos Dumont, less than 100 meters from Campo de Marte, a large area where a wealthy Brazilian family operated the Aeronautics Material park and an airport. [0] was highly athletic, excelling in gymnastics and other sports, and developed an interest in cars and motor racing at the age of four. However, as a small boy, [0] had poor motor coordination and had trouble climbing stairways by the age of three. An electroencephalogram (EEG) was unremarkable (i.e. showed no abnormalities). landowner and factory owner Milton Guirado da Silva and his wife Neide Senna da Silva nicknamed [0] \"Beco\".[page\u00a0needed] At the age of seven, [0] first learned to drive a Jeep around a wealthy Brazilian family's farm and also how to change gears without using a clutch.[0] attended Colegio Rio Branco in the S\u00e3o Paulo neighbourhood of Higien\u00f3polis and graduated in 1977 with a grade 5 in physics along with other grades in mathematics, chemistry, and English. [0] later enrolled in a college that specialised in business administration, but dropped out after three months. Overall, [0]'s grades amounted up to 68%.[page\u00a0needed]Senna's first kart was built by landowner and factory owner Milton Guirado da Silva using a small 1-HP lawnmower engine. [0] started racing at Interlagos and entered a karting competition at the age of 13.[timestamp\u00a0needed] [0] started his first race on pole position, facing rivals who were some years older than [0]; despite started, [0] managed to lead most of his first race before retiring after colliding with a rival. landowner and factory owner Milton Guirado da Silva supported landowner and factory owner Milton Guirado da Silva's and Lucio Pascal Gascon soon managed the developing talent.[timestamp\u00a0needed]Senna went on to win the South American Kart Championship in 1977. [0] contested the Karting World Championship each year from 1978 to 1982, finishing runner-up in 1979 and 1980. In 1978, [0] was the teammate of Terry Fullerton, from whom [0] later felt was the rival [0] got the most satisfaction racing against also because of the lack of money and politics at that level.In 1981, [0] moved to Eaton near Norwich in England to begin single-seater racing, winning the RAC and Townsend Thoresen Formula Ford 1600 Championships 1981 with the Van Diemen team.[citation needed]Despite winning, [0] initially did not believe [0] would continue in motorsport. At the end of 1981, under pressure from landowner and factory owner Milton Guirado da Silva and his wife Neide Senna da Silva to take up a role in the family business, [0] announced [0]'s retirement from Formula Ford and returned to Brazil.[page\u00a0needed] Before leaving England, however, [0] was offered a drive with a Formula Ford 2000 team for \u00a310,000. Back in Brazil, [0] decided to take a drive with a Formula Ford 2000 team and returned to live in England. As da Silva is the most common Brazilian surname, [0] adopted his wife Neide Senna da Silva's maiden name, Senna. [0] went on to win the 1982 British and European Formula Ford 2000 championships. For 1982, [0] arrived with sponsorship from Banerj and Pool.[page\u00a0needed]In 1983, [0] drove in the British Formula Three Championship for the West Surrey Racing team. [0] dominated the first half of the British Formula Three Championship until Martin Brundle, driving a similar car for Eddie Jordan Racing, closed the gap in the second part of the British Formula Three Championship. [0] won the British Formula Three Championship at the final round after a closely fought and, at times, acrimonious battle with the Briton. In November 1983, [0] also triumphed at the inaugural Macau Formula 3 Grand Prix with Teddy Yip's Toyota-powered Theodore Racing Team.[page\u00a0needed]Senna was managed for most of [0]'s career by Armando Teixeira, who was assisted by Domingo Piedade."}, "Formula One career": {"Toleman (1984)": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 1983, [0] tested for Formula One teams Williams, McLaren, Brabham, and Toleman. Peter Warr of Lotus, Ron Dennis of McLaren, and Bernie Ecclestone of Brabham made offers for testing in 1984 and presented long-term contracts that tied [0] to driving later on. During [0]'s test for Williams at the 3.149-km (1.957-mi) Donington Park circuit, [0] completed 40 laps and was quicker than the other drivers, including Williams's reigning World Champion Keke Rosberg. Neither Williams or McLaren had a vacancy for 1984. Both Williams boss Frank Williams and McLaren boss Ron Dennis noted that [0] insisted that [0] got to run Both Williams boss Frank Williams and McLaren boss Ron Dennis's cars before anyone else (other than Both Williams boss Frank Williams and McLaren boss Ron Dennis's regular drivers such as Williams's reigning World Champion Keke Rosberg) so that [0] would have the best chance of a good showing by having a fresh car.Peter Warr of Lotus actually wanted to replace Nigel Mansell with [0] at Lotus, but Lotus's British-based title sponsor, Imperial Tobacco (John Player & Sons), wanted a British driver. [0], however, was determined to drive 1984 and certainly on [0]'s own terms. [0]'s test for Brabham occurred at Circuit Paul Ricard in November 1983. [0] impressed Brabham Brabham and was linked to their second seat. However, Brabham's main sponsor, Italian dairy company Parmalat, wanted an Italian driver. their second seat was eventually shared by brothers Teo and Corrado Fabi, while Piquet convinced Bernie Ecclestone of Brabham to sign Bernie Ecclestone of Brabham's friend Roberto Moreno as the test driver.Consequently, [0] joined Toleman. Venezuelan Johnny Cecotto, a former Grand Prix motorcycle racing world champion, was [0]'s teammate.In 1984, [0] hired Nuno Cobra to assess [0]'s physical condition due to [0]'s concern over [0]'s low weight.[0] made [0]'s debut at the Brazilian Grand Prix in Rio de Janeiro, where [0] qualified 17th, but retired when the Hart 415T turbocharger failed on lap 8. [0] scored [0]'s first World Championship point when [0] finished 6th in [0]'s second race at the South African Grand Prix at Kyalami with severe cramp in [0]'s neck and shoulders, and replicated finished two weeks later at the Belgian Grand Prix.A combination of tyre issues and a fuel-pressure problem resulted in [0]'s failure to qualify for the San Marino Grand Prix, the only time qualify happened during [0]'s career. Toleman decided not to run both cars during Friday qualifying at Imola due to a dispute with tyre supplier Pirelli (Toleman were in the process of switching from tyre supplier Pirelli to Michelin). [0] then suffered a fuel-pressure problem in the wet Saturday session at Tosa (the furthest point on the circuit from the pits) and did not have enough time for a fuel-pressure problem to be fixed to allow [0] to make the grid. [0]'s best result of the season came at the Monaco Grand Prix, the first wet-weather race of the season. Qualifying 13th on the grid, [0] made steady progress in climbing through the field, passing Niki Lauda for second on lap 19. [0] quickly began to cut the gap to race leader Alain Prost, but before [0] could attack race leader Alain Prost, the Monaco Grand Prix, the first wet-weather race of the season was stopped on lap 31 for safety reasons, as the rain had grown even heavier. At the time the Monaco Grand Prix, the first wet-weather race of the season was stopped, [0] was catching race leader Alain Prost by about 4 seconds per lap (while the Tyrrell-Ford of Stefan Bellof was catching both at the same rate, although Stefan Bellof was later disqualified due to weight restrictions broken by Tyrrell).Senna was renowned throughout [0]'s career for [0]'s capacity to provide very specific technical details about the performance of [0]'s cars and track conditions long before the advent of telemetry; this skill led Senna's first F1 race engineer, Pat Symonds, to regard the Dallas Grand Prix in the United States as the initial highlight of [0]'s debut season, instead of the Monaco Grand Prix, the first wet-weather race of the season. Senna's first F1 race engineer, Pat Symonds recalled in an interview: The car was reasonably competitive there, so we expected to have a good race, but [0] spun early in the Dallas Grand Prix in the United States. [0] then found [0]'s way back through the field in a quite effective way and we were looking for a pretty good finish, but then [0] hit the wall, damaged the rear wheel and the driveshaft and retired, which was a real shame. The real significance of retired was that when [0] came back to the pits [0] told [0] what happened and said \"[0]'m sure that the wall moved!\" And even though [0]'ve heard every excuse every driver has ever made, [0] certainly hadn't heard of that one! But Ayrton being Ayrton, with [0]'s incredible belief in [0], the absolute conviction, [0] then talked [0] into going with [0] after the Dallas Grand Prix in the United States to have a look at the place where [0] had crashed. And [0] was absolutely right, which was the amazing thing! Dallas being a street circuit, the track was surrounded by concrete blocks and what had happened \u2013 we could see happened from the tyre marks \u2013 was that someone had hit at the far end of the concrete block and hit made the concrete block swivel slightly, so that the leading edge of the concrete block was standing out by a few millimetres. And [0] was driving with such precision that a few millimetres were the difference between hitting the wall and not hitting the wall. While [0] had been, at first, annoyed that we had retired from the Dallas Grand Prix in the United States through a driver error, when [0] saw what had happened, when [0] saw how [0] had been driving, that increased [0]'s respect for [0] by quite a lot. That season, [0] took two more podium finishes\u2014third at the British and Portuguese Grands Prix\u2014and placed 9th in the Drivers' Championship with 13 points overall. [0] did not take part in the Italian Grand Prix after [0] was suspended by Toleman for being in breach of his contract by entering talks with Lotus for 1984 without informing Toleman first. Although [0] did have a \u00a3100,000 buyout clause in his contract, Toleman had to be informed before discussions with another team started. [0] became the first driver Lotus had signed not personally chosen by team founder Colin Chapman, who had died in 1982.[citation needed]At the end of That season, [0] had developed Bell's palsy, possibly from a virus. One side of [0]'s face had become completely paralysed; Sid Watkins gave [0] steroids to preserve the possibility of recovery.", "Lotus (1985\u20131987)": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was partnered in [0]'s first year at Lotus-Renault by Italian driver Elio de Angelis. [0] had dominated testing times at Rio, although [0] retired with electrical issues during the race weekend. Although the Renault-powered Lotus 97T was quick and nimble, particularly on tight and bumpy circuits and perhaps had the best suspension of any car that year, the Renault-powered Lotus 97T was unreliable and [0] made a few mistakes out of inexperience. At the second round of the season, the Portuguese Grand Prix, [0] took the first pole position of his Formula 1 career. [0] converted the first pole position of his Formula 1 career into [0]'s first victory in the race, which was held in very wet conditions, winning by over a minute from Michele Alboreto in the Ferrari and lapping everyone up to and including 3rd placed Patrick Tambay. the race, which was held in very wet conditions was the first 'Grand Slam' of Senna's career, as [0] also set the fastest lap of the race, which was held in very wet conditions. [0] would later argue it was the best drive of Senna's career, an opinion shared by race engineer Steve Hallam, who recognised [0]'s \"truly special\" talent.[0] led at the San Marino, Monaco, British and German Grands Prix but retired from the San Marino, Monaco, British and German Grands Prix either from engine failure or running out of fuel, and [0] had a huge accident at the French Grand Prix at the Circuit Paul Ricard's fastest corner after an engine failure in the middle of the Circuit Paul Ricard's fastest corner. [0] did not finish in the points again until coming second at the Austrian Grand Prix, despite taking pole three more times in the intervening period. ([0]'s determination to take pole at Monaco had infuriated Michele Alboreto in the Ferrari and Niki Lauda; [0] had set a fast time early and was accused of deliberately baulking the other drivers by running more laps than necessary, a charge [0] rejected, though the accusations continued in Canada when drivers accused [0] of running on the racing line when on [0]'s slow down lap forcing others on qualifiers to move off line and lose time). Two more podiums followed in the Netherlands and Italy, before [0] added [0]'s second victory in wet-dry conditions, at the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps in Belgium. [0]'s relationship with Italian driver Elio de Angelis soured over the season, as both drivers demanded top driver status within Lotus-Renault and, after spending six years at Lotus-Renault, Italian driver Elio de Angelis departed for Brabham at the end of the season, convinced that Lotus-Renault were becoming focused around [0]. both drivers Italian driver Elio de Angelis finished the season 4th and 5th respectively in the driver rankings, separated by five points. In terms of qualifying, however, [0] had begun to establish [0] as the quickest in the field: [0]'s tally of seven poles the season was far more than that of any of the other drivers (Lotus-Renault's V6 qualifying engines were reported to be producing over 1,000\u00a0bhp (746\u00a0kW; 1,014\u00a0PS)).De Angelis was replaced at Lotus-Renault by Scotland's Johnny Dumfries after [0] vetoed Derek Warwick from joining Lotus-Renault, saying that Lotus-Renault could not run competitive cars for two top drivers at the same time. [0] allegedly pushed for [0]'s former flatmate and fellow Brazilian Maur\u00edcio Gugelmin to join Lotus-Renault as a pure number two driver, but Lotus-Renault's major sponsor John Player & Sons (JPS) insisted on a British driver, which led to the signing of Scotland's Johnny Dumfries. [0] later admitted \"It was bad, bad. Until then [0] had a good relationship with Derek Warwick.\" [0] started the season well, coming second in Brazil behind the Williams-Honda of fellow countryman Nelson Piquet, and winning the Spanish Grand Prix by just 0.014s from Piquet's teammate Nigel Mansell in one of the closest finishes in Formula One history to find [0] leading the World Championship after two races. Although the Renault-powered Lotus 97T was like the 97T which came before the Renault-powered Lotus 97T, a quick car with superiority on tight, bumpy circuits but plagued with poor reliability, particularly in the second half of the season the Renault-powered Lotus 97T saw [0] drift behind the the Williams-Honda of fellow countryman Nelson Piquet pairing of Piquet's teammate Nigel Mansell and fellow countryman Nelson Piquet as well as defending and eventual champion, Alain Prost. Nonetheless, [0] was once more the top qualifier with eight poles, with a further six podium finishes included another win at the Detroit Grand Prix, thus finishing the season fourth in the driver's standings again, with a total of 55 points. The 1986 F1 cars were the most powerful cars in history, with the Renault-powered Lotus 97T producing over 1,300\u00a0bhp (969\u00a0kW; 1,318\u00a0PS) in qualifying and 850\u00a0bhp (634\u00a0kW; 862\u00a0PS) in the race.After winning the Spanish Grand Prix from Frenchmen Prost and Jacques Laffite\u2060\u2009\u2014\u2009which took place one day after Brazil was eliminated from the 1986 FIFA World Cup by France\u2060\u2009\u2014\u2009[0] asked a trackside supporter for the Brazilian flag and [0] drove one lap waving the Brazilian flag. Thereafter, [0] repeated drove every time [0] won a race. During an interview on American television, [0] used English curse words to express [0]'s frustration at having to go into the pits earlier than expected due to a deflating rear tire. [0] also had a brief foray into rallying when [0] was invited by British magazine Cars & Car Conversions to try out a Vauxhall Nova, an MG Metro 6R4, a Ford Sierra RS Cosworth and a Ford Escort on a stretch of land closed to the public.Lotus-Renault had a new engine deal in 1987, running the same turbocharged Honda V6 engines as the Williams-Honda of fellow countryman Nelson Piquet had used to win the previous year's Constructors' Championship, and with them came a new teammate, 34-year-old Japanese driver, Satoru Nakajima, who was a test driver employed directly by Honda. Lotus-Renault guaranteed [0] contractually preferential treatment over a new teammate, 34-year-old Japanese driver, Satoru Nakajima, who was a test driver employed directly by Honda in the allocation of equipment. [0] started 1987 with mixed fortunes: a podium at the San Marino Grand Prix was tempered by controversy at the following race at Spa-Francorchamps, where [0] collided with Piquet's teammate Nigel Mansell, and afterward in the pits an irate Mansell grabbed [0] by the throat and had to be restrained by Lotus-Renault mechanics. [0] then won two races in a row, which helped [0] take the lead in the World Championship: the ensuing Monaco Grand Prix (the first of [0]'s record six victories at the Principality) and the Spanish Grand Prix.As the World Championship progressed, however, it became evident that the the Williams-Honda of fellow countryman Nelson Piquet cars had the advantage over the rest of the field, the gap between the Honda-engined teams made most obvious at the British Grand Prix, where Piquet's teammate Nigel Mansell and fellow countryman Nelson Piquet in the superior the Williams-Honda of fellow countryman Nelson Piquet cars lapped the Lotuses of [0] and a new teammate, 34-year-old Japanese driver, Satoru Nakajima, who was a test driver employed directly by Honda who finished 3rd and 4th respectively. [0] became dissatisfied with [0]'s chances at Lotus-Renault and at Monza it was announced that [0] would be joining McLaren for 1988. [0] was fined $15,000 for punching a corner marshal after a corner marshal refused to push his stalled car in Mexico then finished 1987 strongly, coming second in the final two races in Japan and Australia, however post-race scrutineering at the final race found the brake ducts of his stalled car to be wider than permitted by the rules and [0] was disqualified, bringing [0]'s last and most successful season with Lotus-Renault to a sour end. [0] was classified third in the final standings, with 57 points, six podium finishes and only one pole position. 1987 marked a turning point in [0]'s career as, throughout 1987, [0] built a deep relationship with Honda, which paid big dividends, as McLaren had secured the Williams-Honda of fellow countryman Nelson Piquet's supply of Honda's V6 turbo engines for 1988.", "McLaren (1988\u20131993)": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 1988, due to the relationship [0] had built up with Honda throughout the 1987 season with Lotus, and with the approval of McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost, [0] joined McLaren's. The foundation for a fierce competition between Senna and Prost McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost was laid, culminating in a number of dramatic race incidents between Senna and Prost over the next five years. However, Senna and Prost also quickly realized, despite their personal rivalry, Senna and Prost had to work together, especially in testing, to keep ahead of Senna and Prost's main opposition from Ferrari, Williams, Benetton and Lotus.One notable incident of 1988 was at the Monaco Grand Prix, where [0] out-qualified McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost by 1.4 seconds and led for most of the race before crashing on lap 67. Instead of returning to the pit lane, [0] was so distressed by [0]'s that [0] went back to his apartment and did not contact McLaren's until [0] walked into the pit garage as McLaren's were packing up later that night. After team manager Jo Ramirez called [0] through his apartment's cleaner hours after [0] had crashed, [0] was still devastated by [0]'s . As the television cameras had not captured [0]'s , team boss Ron Dennis did not know what had caused [0]'s DNF until then, though McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost speculated that judging from the tyre marks, it appeared as though [0] had clipped the inside barrier at Portier, which pitched [0] into the outside guard rail. At the Portuguese Grand Prix, McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost made a slightly faster start than [0], but McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost, as McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost would a number of times, dived into the fast first corner ahead. McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost responded and went to pass [0] at the end of the first lap. [0] swerved to block McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost, forcing McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost to nearly run into the pit wall at 290\u00a0km/h (180\u00a0mph). McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost kept McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost's foot down and soon edged [0] into the first corner and started pulling away. McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost, was angered by [0]'s manoeuvre, and [0] got away with a warning from the FIA. At the post-race team debrief, McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost voiced McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost's anger at the move which prompted [0] to apologize to McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost for the incident. Ultimately, Senna and Prost won 15 of 16 races in the dominant McLaren MP4/4 in 1988 with [0] coming out on top, winning [0]'s first Formula One world championship title by taking eight wins to McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost's seven. McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost scored more points over the season, but three of McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost's second places were dropped, as only the 11 best scores counted, meaning that [0] bested McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost by three points.However, the biggest incident of 1988 happened at the Italian Grand Prix at Monza. With two laps remaining, [0] held a five-second lead over the Ferraris of Gerhard Berger and Michele Alboreto, who were closing in on McLaren's (McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost had earlier retired with a badly misfiring engine). Going into the Rettifilo chicane, [0] closed on the Williams of Jean-Louis Schlesser (standing in for the unwell Nigel Mansell). Jean-Louis Schlesser (standing in for the unwell Nigel Mansell) steered wide, attempting to give [0] room to lap Jean-Louis Schlesser (standing in for the unwell Nigel Mansell), losing then regaining control to avoid going into the sand trap, and the two collided; Senna's car was beached on top of a curb and had stalled. Ferrari went on to finish 1\u20132, the first in an Italian Grand Prix since the death of McLaren's's founder Enzo Ferrari. the Italian Grand Prix at Monza proved to be the only race McLaren's did not win in 1988.[citation needed]During 1988, [0] rewrote the record books. [0]'s eight wins beat the old record of seven jointly held by Jim Clark (1963) and McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost (1984). [0]'s 13 pole positions also beat the record of nine held by Nelson Piquet (1984).[citation needed]The following year, their personal rivalry McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost intensified into numerous battles on the track and a psychological war off it.[page\u00a0needed] Some controversy also arose after the French GP press conference when team boss Ron Dennis declared that team boss Ron Dennis found consistent differences between the Honda engines from McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost and [0], to the detriment of McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost. Tension and mistrust between Senna and Prost increased when [0] overtook McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost at the restart of the San Marino Grand Prix, overtook McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost ([0] denied the existence of any agreement, though McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost's story was backed up by John Hogan of McLaren's's major sponsor, Marlboro). A discussion between Senna and Prost and team boss Ron Dennis during a test session at the Pembrey circuit in Wales served to effectively confirm Senna and Prost's personal animosity to team boss Ron Dennis and McLaren's. [0] took an early lead in the championship with victories in San Marino, Monaco, and Mexico. [0] also led every lap of San Marino, Monaco, and Mexico, a feat unequalled until Sebastian Vettel replicated led in 2012. [0] also managed to win in Germany, Belgium, and Spain. However, unreliability in four consecutive races in Phoenix, Canada, France and Britain, and further unreliability in Italy, together with collisions in Brazil and Portugal, swung the championship in McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost's favour.McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost took the 1989 world title after a collision with [0] at the Suzuka Circuit in Japan, the penultimate race of the season, which [0] needed to win to remain in contention for the championship. McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost had managed to leave the grid faster than [0] by removing the gurney flap from McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost's , which was unbeknownst to [0]. This reduction in aerodynamic downforce made McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost's faster on the straights, but slower through corners\u2014a clever choice to make it even harder for [0] to pass on a circuit already difficult on which to pass. On lap 46, [0] had finally come next to McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost and attempted a pass on the inside at the tight last chicane. McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost turned right into the tight last chicane, cutting [0] off and tangling wheels with [0]. The collision caused both McLarens to slide to a standstill into the escape road ahead. McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost abandoned the race at that point, whereas [0] urged marshals for a push-start, which [0] received, then proceeding with the race after a pit stop to replace the damaged nose on Senna's car. [0] took the lead from the Benetton of Alessandro Nannini and went on to claim victory, only to be disqualified following a stewards meeting after the race. [0] was disqualified for receiving a push start, cutting the tight last chicane after The collisionMcLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost, and for crossing into the pit lane entry which was not part of the track. A large fine and temporary suspension of [0]'s FIA Super License followed in the winter of 1989, and [0] engaged in public criticism of the FIA and its then-president, Jean-Marie Balestre, whom he blamed for his disqualification in Japan. [0] claimed that its then-president, Jean-Marie Balestre, whom he blamed for his disqualification in Japan had forced the race stewards to disqualify [0] so McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost could win the championship, though the race stewards denied that its then-president, Jean-Marie Balestre, whom he blamed for his disqualification in Japan forced the race stewards's , claiming that its then-president, Jean-Marie Balestre, whom he blamed for his disqualification in Japan was not present when their decision was made. [0] finished the season second with six wins and one second place. McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost left McLaren's for Ferrari the following year. McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost had burned bridges even with team boss Ron Dennis after a trophy-related incident in Italy.In 1990, [0] took a commanding lead in the championship with six wins, two second-places, and three thirds. With McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost gone to Ferrari, [0] also had a new teammate in Austrian driver and friend Gerhard Berger. Among [0]'s victories were the opening round on the wide streets of Phoenix, in which [0] diced for the lead for several laps with Jean Alesi's Tyrrell before coming out on top, and in Germany, where [0] fought Benetton driver Alessandro Nannini throughout the race for the win. [0] won six races, including another Monaco win, and as the season reached the season's final quarter, however, McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost's rose to the challenge with five wins, including a crucial victory in Spain where McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost and teammate Nigel Mansell finished 1\u20132 for McLaren's. [0] had gone out with a damaged radiator, and the gap between Senna and Prost McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost was now reduced to nine points with two races left.As part of Japanese publisher Shueisha's's sponsorship of McLaren's, [0] collaborated with Akira Toriyama, the creator of Dragon Ball, on artwork for Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump featuring McLaren's-themed illustrations of Dragon Ball characters. [0] was also featured in GP Boy, a two-volume manga published in Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump to commemorate Japanese publisher Shueisha's's sponsorship.At the penultimate round of the championship in Japan at Suzuka, where Senna and Prost collided the previous yearMcLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost , [0] took pole ahead of McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost. Before qualifying, [0] had sought assurances from the FIA to move pole position left onto the clean side of the racetrack, but after qualifying, its then-president, Jean-Marie Balestre, whom he blamed for his disqualification in Japan denied [0]'s , leaving [0] to start on the dirty right side, thus favouring McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost on the left. In addition, as revealed by F1 journalist Maurice Hamilton, the FIA had warned that crossing the yellow line of the pit exit on the right to better position oneself at the first corner would not have been appropriate, further infuriating [0]. At the beginning of the race, McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost pulled ahead of Senna, who immediately tried to repass McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost at the first corner. While McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost turned in, [0] kept [0]'s foot on the accelerator and Senna and Prost collided at 270\u00a0km/h (170\u00a0mph) and went off the track, went through the gravel trap and slammed into the tire barrier, making [0] world champion.Following collided, Jackie Stewart interviewed [0] at the subsequent race in Australia (where [0] won pole and led for 61 laps before gearbox trouble forced [0] to slide off into a tyre barrier) and brought up a number of controversial collisions in which [0] had been involved over the last few years, stating that [0] had made more contact with other cars and drivers in the last four years than all the champions before [0]. [0] questioned how someone like Jackie StewartJackie Stewart , could ask questions like Jackie Stewart did, knowing the pressure under which drivers raced and famously said: \"Being a racing driver means you are racing with other people, and if you no longer go for a gap that exists, you are no longer a racing driver.\"A year later, after taking [0]'s third world championship, [0] admitted that [0] had deliberately crashed into McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost at the previous year's Japanese Grand Prix, and [0] then explained to the press [0]'s actions and motives at Suzuka, where Senna and Prost collided the previous year 1990. [0] maintained that prior to qualifying fastest, [0] had sought and received assurances from race officials that pole position would be changed to the left, clean side of the racetrack (where the racing line was), only to find changed reversed after McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost had taken pole. [0] said that [0] was not going to accept what [0] saw as unfair decision-making by the FIA, including [0]'s 1989 disqualification and the incorrect pole position in 1990. [0] stated that no matter what happened, [0] would not yield the tight last chicane and that McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost taking McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost's normal racing line would result in an accident. McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost later went on record criticising [0]'s actions as \"disgusting\", saying that McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost seriously considered retiring from the sport after The collision. During an interview with Eurosport at the Australian Grand Prix McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost revealed that McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost had seen the Honda engine telemetry at Suzuka Suzuka, where Senna and Prost collided the previous year and that the Honda engine telemetry at Suzuka showed that [0] had kept [0]'s foot absolutely flat through the tight last chicane when [0] had hit McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost\u200a\u2014\u200a[0] had not even taken [0]'s foot off the accelerator to change down to 4th for the tight last chicane, strongly intimating that [0] had taken McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost out on purpose.In 1991, [0] became the youngest ever three-time world champion, taking seven wins and increasing [0]'s pole position record to 60 from 127 events. McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost, because of the downturn in performance at Ferrari, the likes of which littered McLaren's's history, was no longer a serious competitor. In preseason testing, [0] made public misgivings about Senna's car's competitiveness with the new Honda V12, stating that the new Honda V12 was not as powerful as the prior year's V10. [0] won the first four races in Phoenix, Brazil, Imola and Monaco as [0]'s rivals struggled to match [0]'s pace and reliability. By midseason, Nigel Mansell in the Adrian Newey designed Williams-Renault was able to put up a challenge later in the season, having only scored six points by the time [0] had 40 points. Before the Portuguese Grand Prix, [0] was injured in a jet-skiing accident near S\u00e3o Paulo for which [0] required stitches on the back of [0]'s head. During qualifying for the Portuguese Grand Prix, [0] attempted to take the banked 180-degree Peraltada corner (Mexico City circuit's fastest corner) faster than normal, ending up spinning off the track and rolling over Senna's car after crashing into a tyre barrier. At the British Grand Prix at Silverstone, Senna's car had come to a halt on the final lap, but [0] was not left stranded out on the track, as Nigel Mansell in the Adrian Newey designed Williams-Renault pulled over on Nigel Mansell in the Adrian Newey designed Williams-Renault's parade lap and allowed [0] to ride on the Williams side-pod back to the pits. [0] then had an enormous accident during testing at the very fast Hockenheim circuit in Germany where Senna's car flew 15 feet into the air after a tyre failure, and turned over several times upon coming down onto the racetrack. Senna's car was destroyed and [0] had to spend the night in hospital in nearby Mannheim. While still able to compete in the German Grand Prix at the Hockenheim circuit soon thereafter, at the German Grand Prix at the Hockenheim circuit [0] ran out of fuel mere laps before the end. At the Spanish Grand Prix, Senna and Prost Nigel Mansell in the Adrian Newey designed Williams-Renault went wheel-to-wheel with only centimetres to spare, at over 320\u00a0km/h (200\u00a0mph) down the main straight, a race which the Briton eventually won.[citation needed]Though [0]'s consistency, Senna's car's competitiveness, and Williams's unreliability at the beginning of the season gave [0] an early advantage, [0] insisted that Honda step up Honda's engine development program and demanded further improvements to the MP4/6 before it was too late. These modifications, including modifications introduced at Hungary and variable inlet trumpets introduced at Belgium enabled [0] to make a late-season push, and [0] won three more races to secure the championship, which was settled in Japan when Nigel Mansell in the Adrian Newey designed Williams-Renault, went off at the first corner while running third and beached Nigel Mansell in the Adrian Newey designed Williams-Renault's in the gravel trap. [0] finished second, handing the victory to Austrian driver and friend Gerhard Berger at the last corner as a thank-you gesture for Austrian driver and friend Gerhard Berger's support over the season. [0] was planning to move to Williams for the 1992 season, but Honda's CEO, Nobuhiko Kawamoto, personally requested that [0] remain at McLaren's, which [0] did out of a sense of loyalty; in addition to McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost's recommendation, Honda had played an important part in bringing [0] with Honda to McLaren.[page\u00a0needed]That year, as had been the case in 1988 and 1990, [0] won the \"International Racing Driver Award\" granted by British magazine Autosport annually. the \"International Racing Driver Award\" granted by British magazine Autosport annually was presented by Stirling Moss and [0] was interviewed on stage by Formula 1 commentator Murray Walker. During interviewed, [0] confirmed that at the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale du Sport Automobile (FISA) gala dinner in Paris the day before, under the auspices of Jackie Stewart, [0] had given one of [0]'s helmets to [0]'s renowned foe, Jean-Marie Balestre, because of the sincere atmosphere that presented itself and as an insulting psychological gesture.In 1990, Senna's determination to win manifested Senna's determination to win in dismay at McLaren's's inability to challenge Williams's all-conquering FW14B car. Williams's all-conquering FW14B car, thanks in part to Williams's all-conquering FW14B car's aerodynamic-enhancing active suspension and powerful Renault V10 engine was much faster than any other car 1990. McLaren's new car for the season had several shortcomings. A delay occurred in getting McLaren's new car for the season running (McLaren's new car for the season was McLaren's's first car with a semi-automatic gearbox and McLaren's new car for the season debuted in the third race of the season, the Brazilian Grand Prix) and in addition to lacking active suspension, McLaren's new car for the season suffered from reliability issues and was unpredictable in fast corners, while McLaren's new car for the season's Honda V12 engine was no longer the most powerful on the circuit. During practice for the second race of the season in Mexico on a badly maintained and extremely bumpy circuit Senna and other drivers were heavily critical of, Senna's car hit a bump at one of a badly maintained and extremely bumpy circuit Senna and other drivers were heavily critical of's Esses corners that caused a loss of downforce and a hard crash into a concrete retaining wall. [0] had to be extricated from Senna's car by circuit doctors while wearing a neck brace; although [0] raced the next day, [0] had to retire from the second race of the season in Mexico due to gearbox failure. [0] scored wins in Monaco, Hungary, and Italy 1990. During qualifying for the Spanish Grand Prix, French driver \u00c9rik Comas crashed heavily and [0] was the first to arrive at the scene. [0] could hear the stricken car's engine revving at max RPM, and [0] exited Senna's car and ran across the track to help French driver \u00c9rik Comas and shut off the stricken car's engine, disregarding [0]'s own safety in an effort to aid a fellow driver. [0] later visited Comas in the hospital. [0]'s actions won universal praise from within Formula 1 and seemed to soften [0]'s hard-nosed image. [0] finished fourth overall in the championship, behind the Williams duo of Nigel Mansell in the Adrian Newey designed Williams-Renault and Riccardo Patrese, and Benetton's Michael Schumacher.[0]'s relationship with Benetton's Michael Schumacher was never a good one, possibly because [0] saw Benetton's Michael Schumacher as a threat to [0]'s supremacy in Formula 1. At the previous year's Japanese Grand Prix, Benetton's Michael Schumacher accused [0] of \"playing around\" while attempting to overtake Senna, who had a problem with [0]'s engine--a fact that Benetton's Michael Schumacher was apparently unaware of at the time. At the French Grand Prix, Benetton's Michael Schumacher collided with [0], resulting in [0]'s retirement. [0] later confronted Benetton's Michael Schumacher. At a test session for the third race of the season, the Brazilian Grand Prix, Senna and Prost Benetton's Michael Schumacher had a confrontation in the pits, with [0] grabbing Benetton's Michael Schumacher by the collar and accusing Benetton's Michael Schumacher of endangering [0] by blocking [0] on the track.Questions about [0]'s intentions for the upcoming 1993 season lingered throughout 1990, as [0] did not have a contract with any team by the end of that year. Ferrari had offered [0] a contract which Senna discussed with Niki Lauda, but decided to decline a contract which Senna discussed with Niki Lauda. [0] felt the McLaren's cars were becoming less competitive than in previous years, especially given Honda's decision to abandon Formula 1 at the end of that year due to economic issues and McLaren's's lack of active suspension relating to rival Williams.Given this scenario, [0] secured an IndyCar testing session with the support of compatriot and Penske driver, Emerson Fittipaldi. In December 1990, in fact, [0] visited Firebird International Raceway in Chandler, Arizona near Phoenix in the United States to test a 1992 Penske PC-21 CART Indianapolis car. Unlike the more advanced Formula 1 cars, a 1992 Penske PC-21 CART Indianapolis car was powered by a turbo Chevrolet-Ilmor V8, had a traditional transmission with clutch pedal and iron brakes, and was markedly heavier due to a 1992 Penske PC-21 CART Indianapolis car's bigger physical size in comparison to a smaller Formula 1 car; IndyCar teams were run with significantly smaller budgets than Formula 1 teams and did not have to make IndyCar teams's own cars. To familiarise [0], [0] initially ran 14 relatively slow laps before completing a further 10 laps on the same tyres and setting a best time of 49.09 seconds. By comparison, compatriot and Penske driver, Emerson Fittipaldi had set a best time of 49.70 seconds, which compatriot and Penske driver, Emerson Fittipaldi later improved to 48.5 seconds, only by using the new 1993 Penske PC-22 at compatriot and Penske driver, Emerson Fittipaldi's disposal during an IndyCar testing session. In a 2018 interview, compatriot and Penske driver, Emerson Fittipaldi revealed that Penske boss Roger Penske was ready to enter a third car for [0] to drive at the 1993 Indianapolis 500 - one of the most prestigious and important races in the world and a race that defending champion Mansell was competing at (who had left Formula 1 for CART) - but when team boss Ron Dennis found out enter was a very serious deal team boss Ron Dennis promptly banned [0] from competing at Indianapolis.For 1993, attempts were made by team boss Ron Dennis to secure a supply of the dominant Renault V10 engines that Williams had found great success with. When attempts failed, [0] went to Williams Williams and sought to take one of Williams's two open rides, as defending champion Mansell joined the IndyCar Series for 1993 and longtime second driver Riccardo Patrese left to drive at Benetton alongside Michael Schumacher. However, despite [0] going so far as to be willing to forfeit [0]'s annual salary just to drive one of Williams's Renaults, this too would fail. McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost was returning to Formula 1 for the first time since the penultimate race of the 1991 season (McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost had been fired by Ferrari prior to the end of 1991, received a massive severance package as part of a non-compete clause, and took leave for the 1992 season) and filled one of the vacant Williams seats. McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost's contract included a caveat that McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost had veto power over who he would team with in the other car for 1993McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost ; since McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost still had ill will toward McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost's McLaren's , McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost used veto power over who he would team with in the other car for 1993 to freeze out [0] and force [0] into what was now a lame-duck season at McLaren's. Faced with this, during the post-race press conference of the 1990 Portuguese Grand Prix at the Estoril Circuit, [0] called McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost a coward, leading to some commentators stating that what McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost had done was no different from [0] vetoing Derek Warwick from joining Lotus in 1986, but some commentators did not take into account that [0]'s chances of winning the championship were much higher in 1993.By this time, McLaren's was forced to take a customer supply of Ford V8 engines, which were two specifications behind that of Ford's then factory team, Benetton. McLaren's hoped to make up for the inferior horsepower with mechanical sophistication, including an effective active suspension system \u2013 though an effective active suspension system an effective active suspension system proved difficult at times, especially for new teammate Michael Andretti. With hoped, team boss Ron Dennis finally persuaded [0] to stay with McLaren's. [0], however, agreed to do so only for the first race in South Africa, where [0] would assess whether McLaren's's equipment was competitive enough for [0] to put in a good season. After driving McLaren's's 1993 car, the McLaren MP4/8, [0] concluded McLaren's new car for the season had surprising potential, albeit with a Ford V8 engine down on power relative to McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost's and less so on Benetton's factory V8. [0] thus extended [0]'s deal with McLaren's on a race-by-race basis instead of a full-year contract, ending up staying for the whole of 1993 in any event. Reportedly, this engagement was on a $1 million per race basis, and, despite midseason testing with a Lamborghini V12 proving encouraging, with McLaren's then signing an engine supply deal with Peugeot for the 1994 season, it all proved insufficient to continue to retain [0] past 1993.[citation needed]In the opening race in South Africa, [0] finished in second place after surviving a collision with Michael Schumacher. [0] won in changing conditions in Brazil and Donington. Donington has often been regarded as one of [0]'s greatest victories, in the process setting a record for the fastest lap in an F1 race driving through the then speed-unrestricted pit lane. In cold, wet, rainy conditions typical of England in April [0] was fifth at the first corner and led the race at the end of the first lap going on to lap all but second place in a race where up to seven pit stops were required by some drivers for rain or slick tyres. [0] then scored a second-place finish in Spain and a record-breaking sixth win at Monaco, breaking Graham Hill's record of five. After Monaco, the sixth race of the 1992 season, [0] unexpectedly led the championship from McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost in Williams. As the 1992 season progressed, McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost asserted the superiority of Alain Prost and Damon Hill's Williams cars, while [0] suffered mechanical failures in Imola, Canada, Britain, Hungary, and Portugal, where McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost took McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost's 4th world championship, losing apparently none of the skill McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost was not able to use during McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost's 1990 sabbatical. [0] won the penultimate race of the season in Japan, which was marked by an incident involving Jordan's rookie Eddie Irvine, twice unlapping himself against Senna. Immediately after the penultimate race of the season in Japan, which was marked by an incident involving Jordan's rookie Eddie Irvine, twice unlapping himself against Senna, [0] angrily stormed into Jordan's's garage and said to Jordan's rookie Eddie Irvine \"Jordan's rookie Eddie Irvine're driving like a f***ing idiot! Jordan's rookie Eddie Irvine're not a racing driver, Jordan's rookie Eddie Irvine're a f***ing idiot!\u201d before punching Jordan's rookie Eddie Irvine in the side of the head. Following that incident, the stewards gave [0] a two race suspended ban for 1993. However, after a discussion between [0] and the president of the FIA, a compromise was reached by removing a two race suspended ban, considering the exemplary attitude of [0] towards [0]'s fellow drivers. removing created some polemic back at the time, both amongst drivers and in the press, considering that during the entirety of the 1993 season, McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost was under threat of a four-race ban for using words to criticize the president of the FIA, thus seemingly implying that punching a fellow driver in the face was viewed as a lesser transgression than criticizing the FIA season concluded in Australia, with [0]'s 41st and last Formula 1 career win, as well as the last win for an active-suspension F1 car (ironically, [0] had the first victory for a car with this technology in Monaco 1987). The win in Adelaide was an emotional one due to [0] ending [0]'s successful career with McLaren's and defeating McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost, for the last time. Because of McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost's imminent retirement from Formula 1, [0] surprised the Formula 1 community by openly welcoming McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost on the top step of the podium, which many considered a sign of pacification between Senna and Prost. Overall, [0] finished the championship second to McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost.", "Williams (1994)": "[0] is our person to focus on. For 1994, [0] was able to finally join the Williams team after Prost retired and was reportedly paid a $20\u00a0million salary. [0] was assigned car number 2, with teammate Damon Hill running car number 0 due to Prost Prost retiring. With [0]'s arrival, a new sponsor came as well. Rothmans International came aboard as the primary backer for the Williams team, with [0] being one of the Williams team's first drivers in the familiar white and navy livery.[citation needed]Rule changes for 1994 had banned active suspension, traction control, and ABS. During preseason testing, the new Williams FW16 car exhibited none of the superiority of the FW15C and FW14B cars that preceded the new Williams FW16 car, and [0] found [0] in close running with the Benetton B194 of Michael Schumacher. [0] expressed [0]'s discomfort with the handling of the new Williams FW16 car, stating, \"[0] have a very negative feeling about driving the car and driving it on the limit and so on\u00a0... Some of a very negative feeling about driving the car and driving it on the limit and so on is down to the lack of electronic change. Also, the new Williams FW16 car has the new Williams FW16 car's own characteristics which [0]'m not fully confident in yet.\" [0] further added, \"1994's going to be a season with lots of accidents, and [0]'ll risk saying that the Williams team'll be lucky if something really serious doesn't happen.\"The first race of 1994 was at Interlagos in Brazil, where [0] took pole position. [0] took an early lead, but the Benetton B194 of Michael Schumacher was never far behind. Michael Schumacher took the race lead after passing [0] in the pits. While trying for a win, Michael Schumacher pushed too hard and spun the new Williams FW16 car coming out of Jun\u00e7\u00e3o corner on lap 56, stalling the new Williams FW16 car and retiring from the race. The second race was the inaugural Pacific Grand Prix at Aida, where [0] again placed the new Williams FW16 car on the pole. However, after being beaten to the first corner by Michael Schumacher, [0] was hit from behind in the first corner by Mika H\u00e4kkinen and [0]'s race came to a definitive end when, while spinning backwards into the first corner's gravel trap, the Ferrari driven by Nicola Larini T-boned the Williams team. Both drivers retired with front-suspension damage. teammate Damon Hill also retired with transmission problems, while Michael Schumacher took the victory again.It was [0]'s worst start to a Formula One season, failing to finish or score points in the first two races, despite taking pole position the first two races. Michael Schumacher was leading [0] in the Drivers' Championship by 20 points. On the occasion of the 20th anniversary of Senna's death, Ferrari president Luca Cordero di Montezemolo revealed that, on 27 April 1994, Ferrari president Luca Cordero di Montezemolo had held discussions at Ferrari president Luca Cordero di Montezemolo's home in Bologna with [0] about a future the Ferrari driven by Nicola Larini engagement.1994 was the subject of sweeping rule changes, most notably banning the use of electronic \"driver aids\" such as active suspension, anti-lock brakes, traction control and launch control. From the start, suspicion of foul play mainly involving the Benetton team was said to have troubled [0]. For example, instead of returning to the pit area after [0]'s first lap retirement at the Pacific Grand Prix, [0] opted to stand near the first corner and watch the cars complete the Pacific Grand Prix to see if [0] could detect whether any now banned traction control system was being used. [0] returned to the Williams pits after the Pacific Grand Prix, suspicious that the the Benetton team car was illegal. Indeed, in an interview for the 20th anniversary of Senna's death, teammate Damon Hill, revealed that [0] had \"concluded that there was, what [0] regarded, as unusual noises from the engine\" with \"special tweak\" giving the Benetton team an advantage.1994 ended at the Australian Grand Prix in Adelaide, where the first-corner chicane at the Adelaide Street Circuit was renamed the \"[0] Chicane\". Michael Schumacher went on to win the driver's world championship title controversially after a collision that forced Michael Schumacher's retirement and that of teammate Damon Hill. At the official FIA conference after the Australian Grand Prix in Adelaide, Michael Schumacher dedicated the driver's world championship title to [0].", "": ""}, "Death": {"": "Aryton Senna is our person to focus on. The 1994 San Marino Grand Prix was held on the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari circuit located in Imola, Italy, between 28 April and 1 May 1994. The European leg of the F1 season, starting at [0], was traditionally considered the beginning of The 1994 San Marino Grand Prix. Aryton Sennathe F1 season, declared that the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari circuit located in Imola, Italy was where Aryton Senna's season would start, with 14 races, as opposed to 16, in which to win the title. Williams brought modified FW16s to [0] in an attempt to improve the car's handling. During the afternoon qualifying session, Senna's compatriot and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Rubens Barrichello was involved in a serious accident when Senna's compatriot and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Rubens Barrichello's became airborne at the Variante Bassa chicane and hit the tyre-wall and fence. Senna's compatriot and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Rubens Barrichello suffered a broken nose and arm, and withdrew from The 1994 San Marino Grand Prix. Senna's compatriot and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Rubens Barrichello reported that Aryton Senna was the first person Senna's compatriot and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Rubens Barrichello saw upon regaining consciousness.During Saturday qualifying, Austrian rookie Roland Ratzenberger was killed after the front wing of his Simtek-Ford broke entering the 310\u00a0km/h (190\u00a0mph) Villeneuve corner, sending his Simtek-Ford into the concrete retaining wall at high speed. Aryton Senna immediately visited the accident scene and medical centre. There Aryton Senna was met by FIA Medical Chief Professor Sid Watkins, who suggested to Aryton Senna that Aryton Senna should retire from racing and take up fishing (a hobby they both shared), to which Aryton Senna replied that Aryton Senna could not stop racing. Aryton Senna was later called in front of the stewards for commandeering an official car and climbing the medical centre fence, and a row ensued, although Aryton Senna was not punished. Aryton Senna spent Aryton Senna's final morning on Sunday talking to former teammate and rival Alain Prost to discuss the re-establishment of the Grand Prix Drivers' Association, a driver's union, with the aim of improving safety in F1. former teammate and rival Alain Prost had retired from F1 at the end of the 1993 season and was now a media presenter. As the most senior driver in competition, Aryton Senna offered to take the role of leader, starting from the next race in Monaco. During the drivers' briefing, concerns had been raised about the mainly promotional use of a Porsche 911 lead car for the warm-up lap, with organizers agreeing to abandon the practice.At the start of The 1994 San Marino Grand Prix, Aryton Senna retained the lead from his chief rival Michael Schumacher, but proceedings were soon interrupted by a startline accident. JJ Lehto's Benetton-Ford stalled and was hit by the Lotus-Mugen Honda of Pedro Lamy. A wheel and debris landed in the main grandstand, injuring eight fans and a police officer. The safety car, a sporty version of the Opel Vectra medium family saloon, was deployed for several laps. However, The safety car, a sporty version of the Opel Vectra medium family saloon,'s lack of speed proved detrimental to the racers, as the slower pace allowed the tyres of the Formula One cars to cool, thus decreasing the tyres of the Formula One cars's pressure. Aryton Senna pulled alongside The safety car, a sporty version of the Opel Vectra medium family saloon, and gestured to the driver, Max Angelelli, to increase Aryton Senna's speed. On lap 6, The 1994 San Marino Grand Prix resumed and Aryton Senna immediately set a quick pace, completing the third-fastest lap of The 1994 San Marino Grand Prix, followed by his chief rival Michael Schumacher needed]As Aryton Senna rounded the high-speed Tamburello corner on lap 7, his car left the racing line at around 307\u00a0km/h (191\u00a0mph), ran in a straight line off the track, and hit the concrete retaining wall at around 233\u00a0km/h (145\u00a0mph), after what telemetry showed to be an application of the brakes for around two seconds. The red flag was shown as a consequence of hit. Within two minutes of crashing, Aryton Senna was extracted from his car by Watkins and Watkins's medical team, including intensive care anaesthetist Giovanni Gordini. The initial treatment took place by the side of his car, with Aryton Senna having a weak heartbeat and significant blood loss from Aryton Senna's temporal artery being ruptured. At this point, Aryton Senna had already lost around 4.5 litres of blood, constituting 90% of Aryton Senna's blood volume. Because of Aryton Senna's grave neurological condition, Watkins performed an on-site tracheotomy and requested the immediate airlifting of Aryton Senna to Bologna's Maggiore Hospital under the supervision of Gordini.[citation needed]At 18:40 (16:40 GMT), the head of Bologna's Maggiore Hospital's emergency department, Maria Teresa Watkins made the announcement that Aryton Senna had died, but said the official time of death under Italian law was 14:17 (12:17 GMT), which is when Aryton Senna impacted the concrete retaining wall and Aryton Senna's brain stopped functioning. Watkins later said that as soon as Watkins saw Aryton Senna's fully dilated pupils, Watkins knew that Aryton Senna's brainstem was inactive and that Aryton Senna would not survive. The right-front wheel and suspension are believed to have been sent back into the cockpit, striking Aryton Senna on the right side of his helmet, forcing Aryton Senna's head back against the headrest. A piece of upright attached to the wheel had partially penetrated his helmet and made a large indentation in Aryton Senna's forehead. In addition, it appeared that a jagged piece of the upright assembly had penetrated the helmet visor just above Aryton Senna's right eye. Aryton Senna sustained fatal skull fractures, brain injuries and a ruptured temporal artery, a major blood vessel supplying the face and scalp. According to Watkins, any one of these three injuries would likely have killed Aryton Senna.It was later revealed that when the medical staff examined Aryton Senna's vehicle, a furled Austrian flag was discovered\u2014Aryton Senna had intended to raise a furled Austrian flag in honour of Austrian rookie Roland Ratzenberger after The 1994 San Marino Grand Prix. Photographs of Senna being treated on the track by emergency medical personnel were taken by Aryton Senna's friend and Autosprint's picture editor, Angelo Orsi. Out of respect, Photographs of Senna being treated on the track by emergency medical personnel have never been made officially public.", "Funeral": "[0] is our person to focus on. Senna's death was considered by many of [0]'s Brazilian fans to be a national tragedy, and the Government of Brazil declared three days of national mourning. The Italian Air Force offered to fly the coffin back to the Government of Brazil, but the Senna family wished that the coffin return home in a Brazilian plane. Contrary to airline policy and out of respect, the coffin was allowed to be flown back to the Government of Brazil in the passenger cabin of a VARIG McDonnell-Douglas MD-11 airliner, accompanied by his distraught younger brother, Leonardo, and close friends. a VARIG McDonnell-Douglas MD-11 airliner was escorted by fighter jets into S\u00e3o Paulo\u2013Guarulhos International Airport on 4 May 1994, where a VARIG McDonnell-Douglas MD-11 airliner was met by the Mayor of S\u00e3o Paulo, Paulo Maluf, and S\u00e3o Paulo's governor, Luiz Ant\u00f4nio Fleury. the coffin was carried by soldiers from the Air Force Police to a fire engine, where eight cadets from the Military Police Academy mounted guard as a VARIG McDonnell-Douglas MD-11 airliner carried the coffin on the 20-mile (32.2\u00a0km) journey into S\u00e3o Paulo. Leading the motorcade were 17 police motorbikes, and 2,500 policemen lined the route to keep the crowds at bay.Over half a million people flocked to the streets of S\u00e3o Paulo to offer [0] Over half a million people's salute, the motorcade. Over 200,000 people filed past as the coffin lay in state at the Legislative Assembly building in Ibirapuera Park. After the public viewing, a 21-gun salute was fired by the 2nd Artillery Brigade and seven Brazilian Air Force jets flew in a diamond formation as the motorcade made the motorcade's way to Morumbi Cemetery. Many prominent motor-racing figures attended [0]'s state funeral, which took place on 5 May, such as team managers Ken Tyrrell, Peter Collins, Ron Dennis, and Frank Williams, and driver Jackie Stewart. The pallbearers included drivers: Gerhard Berger, Michele Alboreto, Alain Prost, Thierry Boutsen, Damon Hill, Rubens Barrichello, Roberto Moreno, Derek Warwick, Maur\u00edcio Gugelmin, Hans Stuck, Johnny Herbert, Pedro Lamy, Maurizio Sala, Raul Boesel, Emerson Fittipaldi, Wilson Fittipaldi, and Christian Fittipaldi. Neither Sid Watkins nor Jo Ram\u00edrez, the McLaren team coordinator, could bear to attend because Sid Watkins nor Jo Ram\u00edrez, the McLaren team coordinator, were so grief-stricken. the Senna family did not allow FOM president Bernie Ecclestone, a friend of Senna's, to attend the motorcade, after an altercation between FOM president Bernie Ecclestone, a friend of Senna's, and his distraught younger brother, Leonardo at Imola regarding FOM president Bernie Ecclestone, a friend of Senna's,'s misconstrued reaction to the news of Senna's death and the fact that the race had not been abandoned after [0]'s accident. FIA President Max Mosley instead attended the funeral of Ratzenberger on 7 May, in Salzburg, Austria. FIA President Max Mosley said in a press conference 10 years later, \"FIA President Max Mosley went to Ratzenberger's funeral because everyone went to [0]'s. FIA President Max Mosley thought it was important that somebody went to [0].\" [0]'s grave bears the epitaph \"Nada pode me separar do amor de Deus\", which means \"Nothing can separate me from the love of God\" (a reference to Romans 8:38\u201339).A testament to the adulation [0] inspired among fans worldwide was the scene at the Tokyo headquarters of Honda, where Honda cars were typically displayed after each race. Upon Senna's death, so many floral tributes were received, so many floral tributes overwhelmed the large exhibition lobby. This was despite the fact [0] no longer drove for a Honda team. [0] had a special relationship with company founder Soichiro Honda[better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] and was beloved in Japan, where [0] achieved a near-mythic status.

Italian law requires that accidents resulting in [0] must be investigated for any criminal culpability, with the associated scene of [0] secured and the activities that led to [0], suspended forthwith. Aryton Senna's death was thus the subject of criminal proceedings in Italy, which saw key Williams team members investigated and charged with manslaughter.

The responsibility of badly designed and badly executed modifications falls on Patrick Head, culpable of omitted control\". Patrick Head, culpable of omitted control, however, was never arrested because the Italian statute of limitation for manslaughter is 7 years and 6 months, and the final verdict was pronounced 13 years after the accident.The criminal charges focused on the car's steering column, which was found to have sheared off at a point where a modification had been made. the prosecution alleged that the car's steering column, which was found to have sheared off at a point where a modification had been made had failed, causing the accident, and the Williams team conceded to a steering column failure, but only as caused by the impact at the Tamburello corner. Aryton Senna had not liked the position of the car's's steering wheel relative to the seating position and had asked for the seating position to be changed. Patrick Head, culpable of omitted control and Adrian Newey satisfied Aryton Senna's by having the car's steering column, which was found to have sheared off at a point where a modification had been made cut and extended with a smaller-diameter piece of tubing, which was welded together with reinforcing plates. extended was carried out in this manner as there was no time to manufacture a new longer steering column in time for the race."}, "Motorsport career outside Formula One": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on.
