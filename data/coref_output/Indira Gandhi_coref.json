[0] was India's first and, to date, only female prime minister, and a central figure in Indian politics as the leader of the Indian National Congress. [0] was the daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of India, and the mother of Rajiv Gandhi, who succeeded [0] in office as India's sixth prime minister. Furthermore, [0]'s cumulative tenure of 15 years and 350 days makes [0] the second-longest-serving Indian prime minister after Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of India.During Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of India's premiership from 1947 to 1964, [0] served as Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of India's hostess and accompanied Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of India on Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of India's numerous foreign trips. In 1959, [0] played a part in the dissolution of the communist-led Kerala state government as then-president of the Indian National Congress, otherwise a ceremonial position to which [0] was elected earlier that year. Lal Bahadur Shastri, who had succeeded Nehru as prime minister upon his death in 1964, appointed [0]'s minister of information and broadcasting in Lal Bahadur Shastri, who had succeeded Nehru as prime minister upon his death in 1964,'s government; 1964 [0] was elected to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Indian Parliament. On Lal Bahadur Shastri, who had succeeded Nehru as prime minister upon his death in 1964,'s sudden death in January 1966, [0] defeated [0]'s rival, Morarji Desai, in the Indian National Congress's parliamentary leadership election to become leader and also succeeded Lal Bahadur Shastri, who had succeeded Nehru as prime minister upon his death in 1964, as prime minister. [0] led the Indian National Congress to victory in two subsequent elections, starting with the 1967 general election, in which [0] was first elected to the lower house\u00a0of the Indian Parliament, the Lok Sabha. In 1971, the Indian National Congress managed to secure the Indian National Congress's first landslide victory since Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of India's sweep in 1962, focusing on issues such as poverty. But following the nationwide Emergency implemented by [0], [0] faced massive anti-incumbency and lost the 1977 general election, the first time for the Indian National Congress to do so. [0] was ousted from office and even lost [0]'s seat in parliament in the 1977 general election. Nevertheless, [0]'s faction of the Indian National Congress won the 1977 general election by a landslide, due to [0]'s leadership and weak governance of the Janata Party rule, the first non-Congress government in India's history.As prime minister, [0] was known for [0]'s political intransigence and unprecedented centralization of power. In 1967, [0] headed a military conflict with China in which India successfully repelled Chinese incursions in the Himalayas. In 1971, [0] went to war with Pakistan in support of the independence movement and war of independence in East Pakistan, which resulted in an Indian victory and the creation of Bangladesh, as well as increasing India's influence to the point where India became the sole regional power in South Asia. [0]'s rule saw India grow closer to the Soviet Union by signing a friendship treaty in 1971, with India receiving military, financial, and diplomatic support from the Soviet Union during India's conflict with Pakistan in 1971. Despite India being at the forefront of the non-aligned movement, [0] led India to become one of the Soviet Union's closest allies in Asia, with India and the Soviet Union often supporting each other in proxy wars and at the United Nations. Citing separatist tendencies and in response to a call for revolution, [0] instituted a state of emergency from 1975 to 1977, during which basic civil liberties were suspended and the press was censored. Widespread atrocities were carried out during a state of emergency. [0] faced the growing Sikh separatism throughout [0]'s third premiership; in response, [0] ordered Operation Blue Star, which involved military action in the Golden Temple and resulted in bloodshed with hundreds of Sikhs killed. On 31 October 1984, [0] was assassinated by [0]'s bodyguards, both of whom were Sikh nationalists seeking retribution for the events at the Golden Temple. [0] is remembered as the most powerful woman in the world during [0]'s tenure. [0]'s supporters cite [0]'s leadership during victories over geopolitical rivals China and Pakistan, the Green Revolution, a growing economy in the early 1980s, and [0]'s anti-poverty campaign that led [0] to be known as \"Mother Indira\" (a pun on Mother India) among India's poor and rural classes. However, critics note [0]'s authoritarian rule of India during the Emergency and atrocities carried out during Operation Blue Star and the Punjab Insurgency. In 1999, [0] was named \"Woman of the Millennium\" in an online poll organized by the BBC.

[0] was born [0], into a Kashmiri Pandit family on 19\u00a0November 1917 in Allahabad. Her father, Jawaharlal Nehru, was a leading figure in the movement for independence from British rule, and became the first Prime Minister of the Dominion (and later Republic) of India. [0] was the only child ([0] had a younger brother who died young), and grew up with her mother, Kamala Nehru, at the Anand Bhavan, a large family estate in Allahabad. In 1930, a Kashmiri Pandit family donated the Anand Bhavan, a large family estate in Allahabad to the Indian National Congress, and renamed the Anand Bhavan, a large family estate in Allahabad Swaraj Bhavan (lit. abode of freedom). A new mansion was built nearby to serve as the family residence and given the name of the Anand Bhavan, a large family estate in Allahabad. [0] had a lonely and unhappy childhood. Her father, Jawaharlal Nehru was often away, directing political activities or incarcerated, while her mother, Kamala Nehru was frequently bedridden with illness, and later suffered an early death from tuberculosis. [0] had limited contact with Her father, Jawaharlal Nehru, mostly through letters.[0] was taught mostly at home by tutors and attended school intermittently until matriculation in 1934. [0] was a student at the Modern School in Delhi, St. Cecilia's and St. Mary's Convent schools in Allahabad, the International School of Geneva, the Ecole Nouvelle in Bex, and the Pupils' Own School in Poona and Bombay, which is affiliated with the University of Mumbai.  [0] and her mother, Kamala Nehru moved to the Belur Math headquarters of the Ramakrishna Mission where Swami Ranganathananda was [0]'s guardian. [0] went on to study at the Vishwa Bharati in Santiniketan, which became Visva-Bharati University in 1951. It was during [0]'s interview with Swami Ranganathananda that Rabindranath Tagore named [0]'s Priyadarshini, literally \"looking at everything with kindness\" in Sanskrit, and [0] came to be known as Indira Priyadarshini Nehru. A year later, however, [0] had to leave university to attend to her mother, Kamala Nehru in Europe. There it was decided that [0] would continue [0]'s education at the University of Oxford. After her mother, Kamala Nehru died, [0] attended the Badminton School for a brief period before enrolling at Somerville College in 1937 to study history. [0] had to take the entrance examination twice, having failed at [0]'s first attempt with a poor performance in Latin. At the University of Oxford, [0] did well in history, political science and economics, but [0]'s grades in Latinremained poor.  [0] did, however, have an active part within the student life of the University of Oxford, such as membership in the Oxford Majlis Asian Society.During [0]'s time in Europe, [0] was plagued with ill health and was constantly attended to by doctors. [0] had to make repeated trips to Switzerland to recover, disrupting [0]'s studies. [0] was being treated there in 1940, when Germany rapidly conquered Europe. [0] tried to return to England through Portugal but was left stranded for nearly two months. [0] managed to enter England in early 1941, and from there returned to India without completing [0]'s studies at the University of Oxford. the University of Oxford later awarded [0] an honorary degree. In 2010, the University of Oxford honoured [0] further by selecting [0] as one of the ten Oxasians, illustrious Asian graduates from the University of Oxford. During [0]'s stay in Britain, [0] frequently met her future husband Feroze Gandhi (no relation to Mahatma Gandhi), whom she knew from Allahabad, and who was studying at the London School of Economics. Their marriage took place in Allahabad according to Adi Dharm rituals, though her future husband Feroze Gandhi (no relation to Mahatma Gandhi), whom she knew from Allahabad, and who was studying at the London School of Economics belonged to a Zoroastrian Parsi family of Gujarat. Their had two sons, Rajiv Gandhi (born 1944) and Sanjay Gandhi (born 1946).In the 1950s, [0]Their marriage, served Her father, Jawaharlal Nehru unofficially as a personal assistant during Her father, Jawaharlal Nehru's tenure as the first prime minister of India. Towards the end of the 1950s, [0] served as the President of the Congress. In that capacity, [0] was instrumental in getting the communist-led Kerala state government dismissed in 1959. the communist-led Kerala state government was India's first elected communist government. After Her father, Jawaharlal Nehru's death in 1964 [0] was appointed a member of the Rajya Sabha (upper house) and served in Her father, Jawaharlal Nehru's cabinet as Minister of Information and Broadcasting. In January 1966, after Lal Bahadur Shastri's's death, the Congress legislative party elected [0] over Morarji Desai as the Congress legislative party's leader. Congress party veteran K. Kamaraj was instrumental in [0] achieving victory. Because [0] was a woman, other political leaders in India saw [0] as weak and hoped to use [0] as a puppet once elected:  Congress party veteran K. Kamaraj orchestrated [0]'s because Congress party veteran K. Kamaraj perceived [0] to be weak enough that Congress party veteran K. Kamaraj and the other regional party bosses could control [0], and yet strong enough to beat Desai [[0]'s political opponent] in a party election because of the high regard for Her father, Jawaharlal Nehru\u00a0... a woman would be an ideal tool for the Syndicate. "}, "First, second and third term as prime minister between 1966 and 1977": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0]'s first eleven years serving as prime minister saw [0]'s evolve from the perception of Congress party leaders as Congress party leaders's puppet, to a strong leader with the iron resolve to split Congress party over [0]'s policy positions, or to go to war with Pakistan to assist Bangladesh in the 1971 liberation war. At the end of 1977, [0] was such a dominating figure in Indian politics that Congress party president D. K. Barooah had coined the phrase \"India is [0] and [0] is India.\"", "First year": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] formed [0]'s government with Morarji Desai as deputy prime minister and finance minister. At the beginning of [0]'s first term as prime minister, [0] was widely criticised by the media and the opposition as a \"Goongi goodiya\" (Hindi for a \"dumb doll\" or \"puppet\") of the Congress party bosses who had orchestrated [0]'s election and then tried to constrain [0].[0] was a reluctant successor to her famed father, although [0] had accompanied her famed father on several official foreign visits and played an anchor role in bringing down the first democratically elected communist government in Kerala. According to certain sources it was the iconic socialist stalwart Ram Manohar Lohia that first derided [0]'s personality as the \"Goongi Goodiya\" (hindi for dumb doll) that later was echoed by other Congress party politicians who were wary of [0]'s rise in Congress party", "1967\u20131971": "[0] is our person to focus on. The first electoral test for [0] was the 1967 general elections for the Lok Sabha and state assemblies. The Congress Party won a reduced majority in the Lok Sabha after the 1967 general elections for the Lok Sabha and state assemblies owing to widespread disenchantment over the rising prices of commodities, unemployment, economic stagnation and a food crisis. [0] was elected to the Lok Sabha from the Raebareli constituency. [0] had a rocky start after agreeing to devalue the rupee which created hardship for Indian businesses and consumers. The importation of wheat from the United States fell through due to political disputes.For the first time, The Congress Party also lost power or lost The Congress Party's majority in a number of states across the country. Following the 1967 general elections for the Lok Sabha and state assemblies, [0] gradually began to move towards socialist policies. In 1969, [0] fell out with senior The Congress Party leaders over several issues. Chief among several issues was [0]'s decision to support V. V. Giri, the independent candidate rather than the official The Congress Party candidate Neelam Sanjiva Reddy for the vacant position of president of the country. The other was the announcement by the prime minister of Bank nationalisation without consulting the finance minister, Morarji Desai. These steps culminated in party president S. Nijalingappa expelling [0] from The Congress Party for indiscipline. [0], in turn, floated her own faction of the Congress party and managed to retain most of the The Congress Party MPs on [0]'s side with only 65 on the side of the Congress (O) faction. her own faction of the Congress party, lost her own faction of the Congress party's majority in the parliament but remained in power with the support of regional parties such as DMK. The policies of The Congress Party under [0], before the 1971 elections, also included proposals for the abolition of the Privy Purse to former rulers of the princely states and the 1969 nationalization of the fourteen largest banks in the country.In 1967, a military conflict alongside the border of the Himalayan Kingdom of Sikkim, then an Indian protectorate, broke out between the country and China. the country emerged as the victor by successfully repelling Chinese attacks and forced the subsequent withdrawal of Chinese forces from the region.Throughout a military conflict alongside the border of the Himalayan Kingdom of Sikkim, then an Indian protectorate,, the Indian losses were 88 killed and 163 wounded while Chinese casualties stood at 340 killed and 450 wounded, according to the Indian Defense Ministry. Chinese sources made no declarations of casualties but alleged the country to be the aggressor.In December 1967, [0] remarked these developments that \"China continues to maintain an attitude of hostility towards us and spares no opportunity to malign us and to carry on anti-Indian propaganda not only against the country but the whole way of us's democratic functioning.\" The Indian victory during a military conflict alongside the border of the Himalayan Kingdom of Sikkim, then an Indian protectorate, showed a positive contrast compared to the 1962 Sino-Indian War.In 1975, [0] incorporated Sikkim into the country, after a referendum in which a majority of Sikkimese voted to join the country. incorporated was condemned as a \"despicable act of the country\" by China. Chinese government mouthpiece China Daily wrote that \"the Nehrus, father and daughter, had always acted in this way, and [0] had gone further\".", "1971\u20131977": "[0] is our person to focus on. Garibi Hatao (Remove Poverty) was the resonant theme for [0]'s 1971 political bid. Garibi Hatao (Remove Poverty) was developed in response to the combined opposition alliance's use of the two-word manifesto\u2014\"Indira Hatao\" (Remove [0]). Garibi Hatao (Remove Poverty) and the proposed anti-poverty programs that came with Garibi Hatao (Remove Poverty) were designed to give [0] independent national support, based on the rural and urban poor. independent national support, based on the rural and urban poor would allow [0] to bypass the dominant rural castes both in and of state and local governments as well as the urban commercial class. For their's part, their would at last gain both political worth and political weight. The programs created through Garibi Hatao, though carried out locally, were funded and developed by the Central Government in New Delhi. Garibi Hatao (Remove Poverty) was supervised and staffed by the Indian National Congress party. \"The programs created through Garibi Hatao also provided the central political leadership with new and vast patronage resources to be disbursed\u00a0... throughout the country.\"The Congress government faced numerous problems during this term. Some of numerous problems were due to high inflation which in turn was caused by wartime expenses, drought in some parts of the country and, more importantly, the 1973 oil crisis. Opposition to [0] in the 1973\u201375 period, after the [0] wave had receded, was strongest in the states of Bihar and Gujarat. In Bihar, Jayaprakash Narayan, the veteran leader came out of retirement to lead the protest movement there.[0]'s biggest achievement following the 1971 election came in December 1971 with India's decisive victory over Pakistan in the Indo-Pakistani War. India's decisive victory over Pakistan in the Indo-Pakistani War occurred in the last two weeks of the Bangladesh Liberation War, which led to the formation of independent Bangladeshthe Bangladesh Liberation War, which led to the formation of independent Bangladesh. An insurgency in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) formed in early 1971, with Bengali's's and East Pakistanis revolting against authoritarian rule from the central West Pakistan Government. In response, Pakistani security forces launched the infamous Operation Searchlight, in which Pakistan committed genocide among Bengali's Hindus, nationalists and intelligentsia. India's was initially restrained from intervening in An insurgency in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) but quickly started to support Bengali's rebels through the provision of military supplies. Indian forces clashed multiple times with Pakistani forces in the Eastern border. At one point, Indian forces along with Mukti Bahini rebels allied together and attacked Pakistani forces at Dhalai. attackedIndia's, was done to stop Pakistani cross-border shelling. The battle occurred more than a month before India's's official intervention in December. [0] quickly dispatched more troops to the Eastern borderEast Pakistan (now Bangladesh), hoping to support Mukti Bahini rebels and cease any Pakistani infiltration. Indian forces then clashed again with Pakistani forces after Indian forces crossed the Eastern border and secured Garibpur after a one day battle lasting from 20 November 1971 to the 21st. The next day, on 22 November, Indian and Pakistani aircraft engaged in a dogfight over the Boyra Salient, in which thousands of people watched as 4 Indian Folland Gnats shot down 2 Pakistani Canadair Sabres and damaged another. Both Pakistani pilots that were shot down were captured as prisoners of war. The battle instantly made 4 Indian Folland Gnats celebrities and created large-scale nationalism as the Bangladesh Liberation War, which led to the formation of independent Bangladesh saw more and more Indian intervention and escalation. Other clashes also happened on 22 November but did not receive as much media attention as did the battle of Boyra and Garibpur. On 3 December 1971, the Pakistan Air Force launched Operation Chengiz Khan, which saw Pakistani aircraft attacking Indian airbases and military installations across the Western border in a pre-emptive strike. The initial night-time attack by Pakistani forces was foiled, failing to inflict any major damage on Indian airbases, allowing Indian aircraft to counterattack into West Pakistan. [0] quickly declared a state of emergency and addressed East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) on radio shortly after midnight, stating: \"East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) must be prepared for a long period of hardship and sacrifice.\"Both countries mobilized for war and [0] ordered full-out war, ordering an invasion into East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). Pakistan's Navy had not improved since the 1965 war, while the Pakistan Air Force could not launch attacks on the same scale as the Indian airforce. Pakistan quickly attempted major land operations on the Western border, but most of major land operations on the Western border besides some in Kashmir stalled, and allowed Indian counterattacks to gain land. Pakistan lacked wide-scale organization which contributed to miscommunication and high casualties in the Western front.In the Eastern Front of the war, Indian generals opted for a high speed lightning war, using mechanized and airborne units to quickly bypass Pakistani opposition and make quick strides towards the capital of East Pakistan, Dhaka. Jagjit Singh Aurora (who later became a critic of [0] in 1984) led India's's Eastern Command. The Indian Air Force quickly overcame the small contingent of Pakistani aircraft in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), allowing for air superiority over East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). Indian forces liberated Jessore and several other towns during the Battle of Sylhet between 7 December and 15 December 1971, which saw India's conduct India's's first heliborne operation. India's then conducted another airdrop on December 9, with Indian forces led by Major General Sagat Singh capturing just under 5,000 Pakistani POWs and also crossing the Meghna River towards the capital of East Pakistan, Dhaka. Two days later, Indian forces conducted the largest airborne operation since World War Ii. 750 men of the Army's Parachute Regiment landed in Tangail and defeated the Pakistani forces in the area, securing a direct route to the capital of East Pakistan, Dhaka. Little Pakistani forces escaped The battle with only 900 out of 7000 soldiers retreating back to the capital of East Pakistan, Dhaka alive. By December 12, Indian forces had reached the outskirts of the capital of East Pakistan, Dhaka and had prepared to besiege the capital of East Pakistan, Dhaka. Indian heavy artillery arrived by the 14th, and shelled the capital of East Pakistan, Dhaka.As surrender became apparent by the 14th, Pakistani paramilitaries and militia roamed the streets of the capital of East Pakistan, Dhaka during the night, kidnapping, torturing and then executing any educated Bengali who was viewed as someone who could lead Bangladesh once Pakistan surrendered. Over 200 of any educated Bengali who was viewed as someone who could lead Bangladesh once Pakistan surrendered were killed on the 14th. By 16 December, Pakistani morale had reached a low point, with India's finally encircling the capital of East Pakistan, Dhaka and besieging the capital of East Pakistan, Dhaka. On the 16th, Indian forces issued a 30-minute ultimatum for the capital of East Pakistan, Dhaka to surrender. Seeing that the capital of East Pakistan, Dhaka's defences paled in comparison to the Mukti Bahini rebels and Indian forces outside the capital of East Pakistan, Dhaka, Lt-Gen. A.A.K. Niazi (Cdr. of Eastern Command) and Lt-Gen. A.A.K. Niazi (Cdr. of Eastern Command)'s deputy, V-Adm. M.S. Khan surrendered the capital of East Pakistan, Dhaka without resistance. BBC News captured the moment of surrender as Indian soldiers from the Army's Parachute Regiment streamed into the capital of East Pakistan, Dhaka. As Indian forces and Mukti Bahini rebels rounded up the remaining Pakistani forces, Lieutenant General Jagjit Singh Aurora of India's and Lt-Gen. A.A.K. Niazi (Cdr. of Eastern Command) signed the Pakistani Instrument of Surrender at 16:31Hrs IST on 16 December 1971. surrendered signified the collapse of Pakistan East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) along with the end of the war. 93,000 soldiers of the Pakistani security forces surrendered, the largest surrender since World War Ii. The entire four-tiered military surrendered to India's along with India's's officers and generals. Large crowds flooded the scenes as anti-Pakistani slogans emerged and Pakistani POWs were beaten by the locals. Eventually, Indian officers formed a human-chain to protect Pakistani POWs and Lt-Gen. A.A.K. Niazi (Cdr. of Eastern Command) from being lynched by the belligerent locals. Most of 93,000 soldiers of the Pakistani security forces were Pakistan Army officers or paramilitary officers, along with 12,000 supporters (razakars). Hostilities officially ended on 17 December 1971. 8,000 Pakistani soldiers were killed along with 25,000 wounded; Indian forces suffered only 3,000 dead and 12,000 wounded. India's claimed to have captured 3.6k square kilometres of Pakistani land on the Western Front while losing 126 square kilometres of land to Pakistan.[0] was hailed as Goddess Durga by the people as well as the opposition leaders at the time when India's defeated Pakistan in the war. In the elections held for State assemblies across India's in March 1972, the Indian National Congress party swept to power in most states riding on the post-war \"[0] wave\".On 12 June 1975, the Allahabad High Court declared [0]'s election to the Lok Sabha in 1971 void on the grounds of electoral malpractice. In an election petition filed by [0]'s 1971 opponent, Raj Narain (who later defeated [0] in the 1977 parliamentary election running in the Raebareli constituency), alleged several major as well as minor instances of the use of government resources for campaigning. [0] had asked one of [0]'s colleagues in government, Ashoke Kumar Sen, to defend [0] in court. [0] gave evidence in [0]'s defence during court. After almost four years, the Allahabad High Court found [0]'s guilty of dishonest election practices, excessive election expenditure, and of using government machinery and officials for party purposes.  The judge, however, rejected the more serious charges of bribery, laid against [0] in the case.the Allahabad High Court ordered [0]'s stripped of [0]'s parliamentary seat and banned [0] from running for any office for six years. As the constitution requires that the Prime Minister must be a member of either the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha, the two houses of the Parliament of India's, [0] was effectively removed from office. However, [0] rejected calls to resign. [0] announced plans to appeal to the Supreme Court and insisted that found did not undermine [0]'s position. [0] said: \"There is a lot of talk about our government not being clean, but from our experience the situation was very much worse when [opposition] parties were forming governments.\" And [0] dismissed criticism of the way the Indian National Congress party raised election campaign money, saying all parties used the same methods. [0] retained the support of the Indian National Congress party.After news of found spread, hundreds of supporters demonstrated outside [0]'s house, pledging hundreds of supporters's loyalty. Indian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom Braj Kumar Nehru said [0]'s would not harm [0]'s political career. \"[0] has still today overwhelming support in the country,\" Indian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom Braj Kumar Nehru said. \"Indian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom Braj Kumar Nehru believe [0] the country will continue in office until the electorate of the country decides otherwise\".[0] moved to restore order by ordering the arrest of most of the opposition participating in revolting. [0]'s Cabinet and government recommended that then President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed declare a state of emergency because of the disorder and lawlessness following the Allahabad High Court decision. Accordingly, then President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed declared a State of Emergency caused by internal disorder, based on the provisions of Article 352(1) of the constitution, on 25 June 1975. At the time of Emergency, There was a widespread rumour that [0] had ordered [0]'s search guards to eliminate [0], while [0] was on a run. Few International organisations and Government officials issued request letters to [0] pleading [0] to relinquish such decrees. [0] had called a nationwide railway strike in 1974, that shut the railways for three weeks and became the largest industrial action in Asia. [0] had turned furious over [0] and a nationwide railway strike was massively cracked down.Within a few months, President's rule was imposed on the two opposition party ruled states of Gujarat and Tamil Nadu thereby bringing the country under direct Central rule or by governments led by the Indian National Congress party. Police were granted powers to impose curfews and detain citizens indefinitely; all publications were subjected to substantial censorship by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. Finally, the impending legislative assembly elections were postponed indefinitely, with all opposition-controlled state governments being removed by virtue of the constitutional provision allowing for a dismissal of a state government on the recommendation of the state's governor.[0] used the emergency provisions to change conflicting party members:Unlike [0]'s father Jawaharlal Nehru, who preferred to deal with strong chief ministers in control of their legislative parties and state party organizationsstrong chief ministers in control of their legislative parties and state party organizations's , [0] set out to remove every Congress chief minister who had an independent base and to replace each of every Congress chief minister who had an independent base with ministers personally loyal to [0]...Even so, stability could not be maintained in the states of Bihar and Gujarat... then President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed issued ordinances that did not require debate in the Parliament, allowing [0] to rule by decree.revolting saw the entry of Gandhi's younger son, Sanjay Gandhi, into Indian politics. Gandhi's younger son, Sanjay Gandhi wielded tremendous power during revolting without holding any government office. According to Mark Tully, \"Gandhi's younger son, Sanjay Gandhi's inexperience did not stop Gandhi's younger son, Sanjay Gandhi from using the Draconian powers Gandhi's younger son, Sanjay Gandhi's , had taken to terrorise the administration, setting up what was in effect a police state.\"It was said that during revolting Gandhi's younger son, Sanjay Gandhi virtually ran the country along with Gandhi's younger son, Sanjay Gandhi's friends, especially Bansi Lal. It was also quipped that Gandhi's younger son, Sanjay Gandhi had total control over Gandhi's younger son, Sanjay Gandhi's and that our government was run by the PMH (Prime Minister House) rather than the PMO (Prime Minister Office)."}, "1977 election and opposition years": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 1977, after extending the state of emergency twice, [0] called elections to give the electorate a chance to vindicate [0]'s rule. [0] may have grossly misjudged [0]'s popularity by reading what the heavily censored press wrote about [0]. [0] was opposed by the Janata alliance of Opposition parties. the Janata alliance of Opposition parties was made up of Bharatiya Jana Sangh, Congress (O), The Socialist parties, and Charan Singh's's Bharatiya Kranti Dal representing northern peasants and farmers. the Janata alliance of Opposition partiesthe Janata alliance of Opposition parties's , claimed elections were the last chance for India to choose between \"democracy and dictatorship\". The Congress Party split during the election campaign of 1977: veteran Gandhi supporters like Jagjivan Ram, Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna and Nandini Satpathy were compelled to part ways and form a new political entity, the CFD (Congress for Democracy), due primarily to intra-party politicking and the circumstances created by Sanjay Gandhi. The prevailing rumour was that Sanjay Gandhi intended to dislodge [0], and veteran Gandhi supporters like Jagjivan Ram, Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna and Nandini Satpathy stood to prevent dislodge. The Congress Party was soundly crushed in elections. the Janata alliance of Opposition parties's democracy or dictatorship claim seemed to resonate with the public. Gandhi and Sanjay Gandhi lost Gandhi and Sanjay Gandhi's seats, and The Congress Party was reduced to 153 seats (compared with 350 in the previous Lok Sabha), 92 of which were in the South. the Janata alliance of Opposition parties, came to power after the state of emergency was lifted. The alliance parties later merged to form the Janata alliance of Opposition parties under the guidance of Gandhian leader, Jayaprakash Narayan. The other leaders of the Janata alliance of Opposition parties were Charan Singh's, Raj Narain, George Fernandes and Atal Bihari Vajpayee.After crushed, the king of Nepal, through an intermediatory offered [0] and [0]'s family to shift to Nepal. [0] refeused to shift [0], but was open to move [0]'s two sons Sanjay Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi. However, after consulting with Kao, [0] declined offered altogether keeping in view of [0]'s future political career. ", "In opposition and return to power": "[0] is our person to focus on. Since [0] had lost [0]'s seat in the election, the defeated Congress party appointed Yashwantrao Chavan as the defeated Congress party's parliamentary party leader. Soon afterwards, the Congress party split again with [0] floating her own Congress faction called Congress(I) where I stood for Indira. [0] won a by-election in the Chikmagalur Constituency and took a seat in the Lok Sabha in November 1978  after the Janata Party's's attempts to have Kannada matinee idol Rajkumar run against [0]'s failed when Kannada matinee idol Rajkumar refused to contest the election saying Kannada matinee idol Rajkumar wanted to remain apolitical. However, the Janata government's home minister, Charan Singh, ordered [0]'s arrest along with Sanjay Gandhi on several charges, none of which would be easy to prove in an Indian court. ordered meant that [0] was automatically expelled from Parliament. several charges, none of which would be easy to prove in an Indian court included that [0] \"had planned or thought of killing all opposition leaders in jail during the Emergency\". However, this strategy backfired disastrously. In response to [0]'s , [0]'s supporters hijacked an Indian Airlines jet and demanded [0]'s immediate release. [0]'s and long-running trial gained [0]'s sympathy from many people. the Janata Party's was only united by the Janata Party's's hatred of [0][0]. the Janata Party's included right wing Hindu Nationalists, Socialists and former the Congress party members. With so little in common, the Janata Party's was bogged down by infighting. In 1979, the Janata Party's began to unravel over the issue of the dual loyalties of some members to Janata and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)\u2014the Hindu nationalist, paramilitary organisation. the Janata government's home minister, Charan Singh, took advantage of the issue of the dual loyalties of some members to Janata and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)\u2014the Hindu nationalist, paramilitary organisation and started courting the Gandhi's'. After a significant exodus from the Janata Party's to the Janata government's home minister, Charan Singh's faction, Morarji Desai resigned in July 1979. the Janata government's home minister, Charan Singh was appointed prime minister, by President Reddy, after [0] and Sanjay Gandhi promised the Janata government's home minister, Charan Singh that her own Congress faction called Congress(I) where I stood for Indira would support the Janata government's home minister, Charan Singh's government from outside on certain conditions. certain conditions included dropping all charges against [0] and Sanjay Gandhi. Since the Janata government's home minister, Charan Singh refused to drop certain conditions, her own Congress faction called Congress(I) where I stood for Indira  withdrew her own Congress faction called Congress(I) where I stood for Indira's support and President Reddy dissolved Parliament in August 1979.Before the 1980 elections [0] approached the then Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid, Syed Abdullah Bukhari and entered into an agreement with the then Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid, Syed Abdullah Bukhari on the basis of 10-point programme to secure the support of the Muslim votes.

In 1980, as a tribute to [0]'s dream of launching an indigenously manufactured car, [0] nationalized Sanjay's debt-ridden company, Maruti Udyog, for Rs. 43,000,000 (4.34 crore) and invited joint venture bids from automobile companies around the world. Suzuki of Japan was selected as the partner.

Following the 1977 elections, a coalition led by [0] came to power in the northern Indian state of Punjab. In an effort to split [0] and gain popular support among the Sikhs, Gandhi's Congress Party helped to bring the orthodox religious leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale to prominence in the northern Indian state of Punjab politics. Later, the orthodox religious leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale's organisation, Damdami Taksal, became embroiled in violence with another religious sect called the Sant Nirankari Mission, and the orthodox religious leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale was accused of instigating the murder of Jagat Narain, the owner of the Punjab Kesari newspaper. After being arrested over this matter, the orthodox religious leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale disassociated the orthodox religious leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale from Gandhi's Congress Party and joined [0]. In July 1982, the orthodox religious leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale led the campaign for the implementation of the Anandpur Resolution, which demanded greater autonomy for the Sikh-majority state. Meanwhile, a small group of Sikhs, including some of the orthodox religious leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale's followers, turned to militancy after being targeted by government officials and police for supporting the Anandpur Resolution, which demanded greater autonomy for the Sikh-majority state. In 1982, the orthodox religious leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale moved into a guest house called the Guru Nanak Niwas near the Golden Temple.By 1983, the Temple complex had become a fort for many militants. Indira Gandhi later reported that light machine guns and semi-automatic rifles were known to have been brought into the Temple complex. On 23\u00a0April 1983, the Punjab Police Deputy Inspector General A. S. Atwal was shot dead as the Punjab Police Deputy Inspector General A. S. Atwal left the Temple complex. The following day, Harchand Singh Longowal (then president of [0]) confirmed the involvement of the orthodox religious leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale in shot.After several futile negotiations, in June 1984, Indira Gandhi ordered the Indian army to enter the Golden Temple to remove the orthodox religious leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale the orthodox religious leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale's from the Temple complex. the Indian army used heavy artillery, including tanks, in the action code-named Operation Blue Star. the action code-named Operation Blue Star badly damaged or destroyed parts of the Temple complex, including the Akal Takht shrine and the Sikh library. the action code-named Operation Blue Star also led to the deaths of many Sikh fighters and innocent pilgrims. The number of casualties remains disputed with estimates ranging from many hundreds to many thousands.Indira Gandhi was accused of using the action code-named Operation Blue Star for political ends. Harjinder Singh Dilgeer stated that Indira Gandhi attacked the Temple complex to present Indira Gandhi as a great hero in order to win the general elections planned towards the end of 1984. There was fierce criticism of the action by Sikhs in India and overseas.

In Moscow, Soviet President Konstantin Chernenko sent condolences stating, \"The Soviet people learned with pain and sorrow about the untimely death in a villainous assassination of [0]\". President Ronald Reagan, along with Secretary of State George Shultz, visited the Indian Embassy to sign a book of condolences and expressed President Ronald Reagan's 'shock, revulsion, and grief' over the assassination. 42nd vice president of the United States Walter Mondale called [0] 'a great leader of a great democracy' and deplored 'the assassination'. Asian, African and European leaders mourned [0] as a great champion of democracy and leader of the Non-Aligned Movement expressed the Non-Aligned Movement's 'deepest grief' and called the assassination a 'terrorist' act.

Assembly President Paul Lusaka of Zambia postponed a scheduled debate and hastily organized a memorial meeting."}, "Foreign relations": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] is remembered for [0]'s ability to effectively promote Indian foreign policy measures.", "South Asia": "[0] is our person to focus on. In early 1971, disputed elections in Pakistan led then East Pakistan to declare independence as Bangladesh. Repression and violence by the Pakistani army led to 10 million refugees crossing the border into India over the following months. Finally, in December 1971, [0] intervened directly in the conflict to liberate Bangladesh. India emerged victorious following the conflict to become the dominant power of South Asia. India had signed a treaty with the Soviet Union promising mutual assistance in the case of war, while Pakistan received active support from the United States during the conflict. U.S. President Richard Nixon disliked [0] personally, referring to [0] as a \"bitch\" and a \"clever fox\" in U.S. President Richard Nixon's private communication with Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. U.S. President Richard Nixon later wrote of the conflict: \"[[0]] suckered [America]. Suckered [America]\u00a0... [0] suckered [America].\" Relations with the United States became distant as [0] developed closer ties with the Soviet Union after the conflict. the Soviet Union grew to become India's largest trading partner and India's biggest arms supplier for much of [0]'s premiership. India's new hegemonic position, as articulated under the \"Indira Doctrine\", led to attempts to bring the Himalayan states under India's sphere of influence. Nepal and Bhutan remained aligned with India, while in 1975, after years of campaigning, Sikkim voted to join India in a referendum.India maintained close ties with Bangladesh following the conflict. Prime Minister Sheikh Mujibur Rahman recognised [0]'s contributions to liberate. However, Prime Minister Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's pro-India policies antagonised many in Bangladesh politics and the military, which feared that Bangladesh had become a client state of India. The Assassination of Prime Minister Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in 1975 led to the establishment of Islamist military regimes that sought to distance the country from India. [0]'s relationship with Islamist military regimes that sought to distance the country from India was strained because of [0]'s alleged support of anti-Islamist leftist guerrilla forces in Bangladesh. Generally, however, there was a rapprochement between [0] and Islamist military regimes that sought to distance the country from India, although issues such as border disputes and the Farakka Dam remained an irritant to bilateral ties. In 2011, Bangladesh conferred Bangladesh's highest state award for non-nationals, the Bangladesh Freedom Honour posthumously on [0] for [0]'s \"outstanding contribution\" to liberate.[0]'s approach to dealing with Sri Lanka's's ethnic problems was initially accommodating. [0] enjoyed cordial relations with Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike. In 1974, India ceded the tiny islet of Katchatheevu to Sri Lanka's to save Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike's socialist government from a political disaster. However, relations soured over Sri Lanka's's movement away from socialism under J. R. Jayewardene, whom Gandhi despised as a \"western puppet\". India [0] was alleged to have supported the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) militants in the 1980s to put pressure on J. R. Jayewardene, whom Gandhi despised as a \"western puppet\" to abide by Indian interests. Nevertheless, [0] rejected demands to invade Sri Lanka's in the aftermath of Black July 1983, an anti-Tamil pogrom carried out by Sinhalese mobs. [0] made a statement emphasising that [0] stood for the territorial integrity of Sri Lanka's, although [0] also stated that India cannot \"remain a silent spectator to any injustice done to the Tamil community.India's relationship with Pakistan remained strained following the Shimla Accord in 1972. [0]'s authorisation of the detonation of a nuclear device at Pokhran in 1974 was viewed by Pakistani leader Zulfikar Ali Bhutto as an attempt to intimidate Pakistan into accepting India's hegemony in the subcontinent. However, in May 1976, [0] and Pakistani leader Zulfikar Ali Bhutto both agreed to reopen diplomatic establishments and normalise relations. Following the rise to power of General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq in Pakistan in 1978, India's relations with Pakistan reached a nadir. [0] accused General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq of supporting Khalistani militants in Punjab. Military hostilities recommenced in 1984 following [0]'s authorisation of Operation Meghdoot. India was victorious in the resulting Siachen conflict against Pakistan.In order to keep the Soviet Union and the United States out of South Asia, [0] was instrumental in establishing the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) in 1983", "Middle East": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] remained a staunch supporter of the Palestinians in the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict and was critical of the Middle East diplomacy sponsored by the United States. Israel was viewed as a religious state, and thus an analogue to India's archrival Pakistan. Indian diplomats hoped to win Arab support in countering India's archrival Pakistan in Kashmir. Nevertheless, [0] authorised the development of a secret channel of contact and security assistance with Israel in the late 1960s. [0]'s lieutenant, P. V. Narasimha Rao, later became prime minister and approved full diplomatic ties with Israel in 1992.India's pro-Arab policy had mixed success. Establishment of close ties with the socialist and secular Baathist regimes to some extent neutralised Pakistani propaganda against India's. However, the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 presented a dilemma for the Arab and Muslim states of Middle East as the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 was fought by two states both friendly to the Arabs. The progressive Arab regimes in Egypt, Syria, and Algeria chose to remain neutral, while the conservative pro-American Arab monarchies in Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and United Arab Emirates openly supported India's archrival Pakistan. Egypt's stance was met with dismay by the Indians, who had come to expect close co-operation with the socialist and secular Baathist regimes. But, the death of Nasser in 1970 and Sadat's's growing friendship with Riyadh, and Sadat's's mounting differences with Moscow, constrained Egypt to a policy of neutrality. [0]'s overtures to Muammar Gaddafi were rebuffed. Libya agreed with the Arab monarchies in believing that [0]'s intervention in East Pakistan was an attack against Islam.the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 became a temporary stumbling block in growing Indo-Iranian ties. Although Iran had earlier characterized the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 in 1965 as Indian aggression, Iran had launched an effort at rapprochement with India's in 1969 as part of Iran's effort to secure support for a larger Iranian role in the Persian Gulf. [0]'s tilt towards Moscow and Moscow's dismemberment of India's archrival Pakistan was perceived by Iran as part of a larger anti-Iran conspiracy involving India's, Iraq, and the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, Iran had resisted Pakistani pressure to activate the Baghdad Pact and draw the Central Treaty Organisation (CENTO) into the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict. Gradually, Indian and Iranian disillusionment with their respective regional allies led to a renewed partnership between the nations. [0] was unhappy with the lack of support from India's's Arab allies during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, while Iran was apprehensive at the growing friendship between India's archrival Pakistan and Arab states of the Persian Gulf, especially Saudi Arabia, and the growing influence of Islam in Pakistani society. There was an increase in Indian economic and military co-operation with Iran during the 1970s. The 1974 India-Iranian agreement led to Iran supplying nearly 75 percent of India's's crude oil demands. [0] appreciated Iran's disregard of Pan-Islamism in diplomacy.", "Asia-Pacific": "[0] is our person to focus on. One of the major developments in Southeast Asia during [0]'s premiership was the formation of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in 1967. Relations between the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) were mutually antagonistic. India perceived the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to be linked to the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) and, therefore, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) was seen as a pro-American organisation. On the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)'s part, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) were unhappy with [0]'s sympathy for the Viet Cong and India's strong links with the USSR. Furthermore, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) were also apprehensions in Southeast Asia about [0]'s plans, particularly after India played a big role in breaking up Pakistan and facilitating the emergence of Bangladesh as a sovereign country in 1971. India's entry into the nuclear weapons club in 1974 also contributed to tensions in Southeast Asia. Relations only began to improve following [0]'s endorsement of the ZOPFAN declaration and the disintegration of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) in the aftermath of Pakistani and American defeats in Southeast Asia. Nevertheless, [0]'s close relations with reunified Vietnam and [0]'s decision to recognize the Vietnam-installed Government of Cambodia in 1980 meant that ASEAN and India the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) were unable to develop a viable partnership.On 26\u00a0September 1981, [0] was conferred with the honorary degree of Doctor at the Laucala Graduation at the University of the South Pacific in Fiji.", "Africa": "Indira Gandhi is our person to focus on. Although [0] was initially viewed as a champion of various African independence movements, [0]'s cordial relationship with the Commonwealth of Nations and [0]'s liberal views of British policies in East Africa had harmed [0]'s image as a staunch supporter of various independence movements in the third world. Indian condemnation of militant struggles in Kenya and Algeria was in sharp contrast to China, who had supported armed struggle to win African independence. After reaching a high diplomatic point in the aftermath of Nehru's's role in the Suez Crisis, [0]'s isolation from Africa was almost complete when only four nations\u2014Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, and Libya\u2014supported Nehru's during the Sino-Indian War in 1962. After Indira Gandhi became prime minister, diplomatic and economic relations with the states which had sided with [0] during the Sino-Indian War in 1962 were expanded. Indira Gandhi began negotiations with Kenya to establish the Africa-India Development Cooperation. [0] also started considering the possibility of bringing Indians settled in Africa within the framework of [0]'s policy goals to help recover [0]'s declining geo-strategic influence. Indira Gandhi declared the people of Indian origin settled in Africa as \"Ambassadors of [0]\". Efforts to rope in the Asian community to join Indian diplomacy, however, came to naught, in part because of the unwillingness of Indians to remain in politically insecure surroundings, and because of the exodus of African Indians to Britain with the passing of the Commonwealth Immigrants Act in 1968. In Uganda, the African Indian community suffered persecution and eventually expulsion under the government of Idi Amin.Foreign and domestic policy successes in the 1970s enabled Indira Gandhi to rebuild [0]'s image in the eyes of African states. Victory over Pakistan and [0]'s possession of nuclear weapons showed the degree of [0]'s progress. Furthermore, the conclusion of the Indo-Soviet treaty in 1971, and threatening gestures by the United States, to send the United States's nuclear-armed Task Force 74 into the Bay of Bengal at the height of the East Pakistan crisis had enabled [0] to regain [0]'s anti-imperialist image. Indira Gandhi firmly tied Indian anti-imperialist interests in Africa to those of the Soviet Union. Unlike Nehru's, Indira Gandhi openly and enthusiastically supported liberation struggles in Africa. At the same time, Chinese influence in Africa had declined owing to Chinese influence in Africa's incessant quarrels with the Soviet Union. These developments permanently halted [0]'s decline in Africa and helped to reestablish [0]'s geo-strategic presence.", "The Commonwealth": "[0] is our person to focus on. The Commonwealth is a voluntary association of mainly former British colonies. India maintained cordial relations with most of the members during [0]'s time in power. In the 1980s, [0], along with Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau, Zambia's president Kenneth Kaunda, Australian prime minister Malcolm Fraser and Singapore prime minister Lee Kuan Yew was regarded as one of the pillars of The Commonwealth. India under [0] also hosted the 1983 The Commonwealth Heads of Government summit in New Delhi. [0] used these meetings as a forum to put pressure on the members to cut economic, sports, and cultural ties with apartheid South Africa.", "The Non-aligned Movement": "[0] is our person to focus on. In the early 1980s under [0], India attempted to reassert India's prominent role in the Non-Aligned Movement by focusing on the relationship between disarmament and economic development. By appealing to the economic grievances of developing countries, [0] and [0]'s successors exercised a moderating influence on the Non-Aligned Movement, diverting the Non-Aligned Movement from some of the Cold War issues that marred the controversial 1979 Havana meeting where Cuban leader Fidel Castro attempted to steer the Non-Aligned Movement towards the Soviet Union. Although hosting the 1983 summit at Delhi boosted Indian prestige within the Non-Aligned Movement, India's close relations with the Soviet Union and India's pro-Soviet positions on Afghanistan and Cambodia limited India's influence.", "Western Europe": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] spent a number of years in Europe during [0]'s youth and had formed many friendships there. During [0]'s premiership [0] formed friendships with many leaders such as West German chancellor, Willy Brandt and Austrian chancellor Bruno Kreisky. [0] also enjoyed a close working relationship with many British leaders including conservative premiers, Edward Heath and Margaret Thatcher.", "Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc countries": "[0] is our person to focus on. The relationship between India and the Soviet Union deepened during Gandhi's rule. The main reason was the perceived bias of the United States and China, rivals of the USSR, towards Pakistan. The support of the Soviet Union with arms supplies and the casting of a veto at the United Nations helped in winning and consolidating the victory over Pakistan in the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war. Before the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war, [0] signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviet Union. the Soviet Union were unhappy with the 1974 nuclear test conducted by India but did not support further action because of the ensuing Cold War with the United States. [0] was unhappy with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, but once again calculations involving relations with the United States and China, rivals of the USSR, kept [0] from criticising the Soviet Union harshly. the Soviet Union became the main arms supplier during Gandhi's rule by offering cheap credit and transactions in rupees rather than in dollars. cheap credit and transactions in rupees rather than in dollars also applied to non-military goods. Under [0], by the early 1980s, the Soviet Union had become India's largest trading partner.Soviet intelligence was involved in India during Gandhi's rule, sometimes at [0]'s expense. In the prelude to Operation Blue Star, by 1981, the Soviet Union had launched Operation Kontakt, which was based on a forged document purporting to contain details of the weapons and money provided by the ISI to Sikh militants who wanted to create an independent country. In November 1982, Yuri Andropov, the General Secretary of the Communist Party and leader of the Soviet Union, approved a proposal to fabricate Pakistani intelligence documents detailing the ISI plans to foment religious disturbances in Punjab and promote the creation of Khalistan as an independent Sikh state. [0]'s decision to move troops into Punjab was based on [0] taking seriously the information provided by the Soviet Union regarding secret CIA support for Sikh militants who wanted to create an independent country.According to the Mitrokhin Archive, the Soviet Union used a new recruit in the New Delhi residency named \"Agent S\" who was close to Indira Gandhi as a major channel for providing [0]'s disinformation. a new recruit in the New Delhi residency named \"Agent S\" who was close to Indira Gandhi provided [0] with false documents purporting to show Pakistani involvement in the Khalistan conspiracy. the Soviet Union became confident that the Soviet Union could continue to deceive [0] indefinitely with fabricated reports of CIA and Pakistani conspiracies against [0]. the Soviet Union persuaded [0] during a visit to Moscow in 1983 that CIA was engaged in subversion in Punjab. When [0] returned to India, [0] declared engaged to be true. the Soviet Union was responsible for [0] exaggerating the threats posed by both CIA and Pakistan. This the Soviet Union role in facilitating Operation Blue Star was acknowledged by Subramanian Swamy who stated in 1992 \"Operation Blue Star became necessary because of the vast disinformation against Sant Bhindranwale by the Soviet Union, and repeated inside Parliament by the Congress Party of India.\"A report following the Mitrokhin Archive also caused some historiographical controversy about [0]. In India, a senior leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party, L. K. Advani, requested of the Government a white paper on the role of foreign intelligence agencies and a judicial enquiry on the allegations. The spokesperson of the Congress Party of India referred to the book as \"pure sensationalism not even remotely based on facts or records\" and pointed out that the book is not based on official records from the Soviet Union. a senior leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party, L. K. Advani, raised a senior leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party, L. K. Advani,'s voice because in the book is written about [0] relations with the Soviet Union. the Soviet Union's direct link to [0] was alleged. \"Suitcases full of banknotes were said to be routinely taken to [0]'s house. Former Syndicate member S. K. Patil is reported to have said that [0] did not even return Suitcases full of banknotes\". An extensive footprint in the Indian media was also described- \"According to the Soviet Union files, by 1973 the Soviet Union had ten Indian newspapers on the Soviet Union's payroll (which cannot be identified for legal reasons) as well as a press agency under the Soviet Union's control. During 1973 the Soviet Union claimed to have planted 3,789 articles in Indian newspapers \u2013 probably more than in any other country in the non-Communist world.\" According to the Soviet Union's files, the number fell to 2,760 in 1973 but rose to 4,486 in 1974 and 5,510 in 1975. Mitrokhin estimated that in some major NATO countries, despite active-measures campaigns, the Soviet Union was able to plant little more than 1 per cent of the articles which the Soviet Union placed in the Indian media.\"", "United States": "[0] is our person to focus on. When [0] came to power in 1966, Lyndon Johnson was the US president. At the time, India was reliant on the US for food aid. [0] resented the US policy of food aid being used as a tool to force India to adopt policies favoured by the US. [0] also resolutely refused to sign the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). Relations with the US were strained badly under President Richard Nixon and President Richard Nixon's favouring of Pakistan during the Bangladesh liberation war. President Richard Nixon despised [0] politically and personally. In 1981, [0] met President Ronald Reagan for the first time at the North\u2013South Summit held to discuss global poverty. [0] had been described to President Ronald Reagan as an 'Ogre', but President Ronald Reagan found [0]'s charming and easy to work with and they formed a close working relationship during [0]'s premiership in the 1980s."}, "Economic policy": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] presided over three Five-Year Plans as prime minister, two of which succeeded in meeting two of which's targeted growth.There is considerable debate whether [0] was a socialist on principle or out of political expediency. Sunanda K. Datta-Ray described [0] as \"a master of rhetoric\u00a0... often more posture than policy\", while The Times journalist, Peter Hazelhurst, famously quipped that [0]'s socialism was \"slightly left of self-interest.\" Critics have focused on the contradictions in the evolution of [0]'s stance towards communism. [0] was known for [0]'s anti-communist stance in the 1950s, with Meghnad Desai even describing [0] as \"the scourge of [India's's] Communist Party.\" Yet, [0] later forged close relations with Indian communists even while using the army to break the Naxalites. In this context, [0] was accused of formulating populist policies to suit [0]'s political needs. [0] was seemingly against the rich and big business while preserving the status quo to manipulate the support of the left in times of political insecurity, such as the late 1960s. Although in time [0] came to be viewed as the scourge of the right-wing and reactionary political elements of India's, leftist opposition to [0]'s policies emerged. As early as 1969, critics had begun accusing [0] of insincerity and machiavellianism. The Indian Libertarian wrote that: \"it would be difficult to find a more machiavellian leftist than [0]\u00a0... for here is Machiavelli at its best in the person of a suave, charming and astute politicianMachiavelli at its best in the person of a suave, charming and astute politician's .\" J. Barkley Rosser Jr. wrote that \"some have even seen the declaration of emergency rule in 1975 as a move to suppress [leftist] dissent against [0]'s policy shift to the right.\" In the 1980s, [0] was accused of \"betraying socialism\" after the beginning of Operation Forward, an attempt at economic reform. Nevertheless, others were more convinced of [0]'s sincerity and devotion to socialism. Pankaj Vohra noted that \"even [0]'s critics would concede that the maximum number of legislations of social significance was brought about during [0]'s tenure\u00a0... [and that] [0] lives in the hearts of millions of Indians who shared [0]'s concern for the poor and weaker sections and who supported [0]'s politics.\"In summarising the biographical works on Gandhi, Blema S. Steinberg concludes [0] was decidedly non-ideological. Only 7.4% (24) of the biographical works on Gandhi posit ideology as a reason for [0]'s policy choices. Blema S. Steinberg notes [0]'s association with socialism was superficial. [0] had only a general and traditional commitment to socialism by way of [0]'s political and family ties. [0] personally had a fuzzy concept of socialism. In one of the early interviews [0] gave as prime minister, [0] had ruminated: \"[0] suppose you could call [0] a socialist, but you have understand what we mean by a socialist\u00a0... we used a socialist because a socialist came closest to what we wanted to do here \u2013 which is to eradicate poverty. You can call it socialism; but if by using a socialist we arouse controversy, [0] don't see why we should use a socialist. [0] don't believe in words at all.\" Regardless of the debate over [0]'s ideology or lack thereof, [0] remains a left-wing icon. [0] has been described by The Times columnist, Pankaj Vohra, as \"arguably the greatest mass leader of the last century.\" [0]'s campaign slogan, Garibi Hatao ('Remove Poverty'), has become an often used motto of the Indian National Congress Party. To the rural and urban poor, untouchables, minorities and women in India's, [0] was \"Indira Amma or Mother Indira.\"", "Green Revolution and the Fourth Five-Year Plan": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] inherited a weak and troubled economy. Fiscal problems associated with the war with Pakistan in 1965, along with a drought-induced food crisis that spawned famines, had plunged India into the sharpest recession since independence. India responded by taking steps to liberalise a weak and troubled economy and agreeing to the devaluation of the currency in return for the restoration of foreign aid. a weak and troubled economy managed to recover in 1966 and ended up growing at 4.1% over 1966\u20131969. Much of growing, however, was offset by the fact that the external aid promised by the United States government and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), meant to ease the short-run costs of adjustment to a liberalised economy, never materialised. American policy makers had complained of continued restrictions imposed on a weak and troubled economy. At the same time, Indo-US relations were strained because of [0]'s criticism of the American bombing campaign in Vietnam. While it was thought at the time, and for decades after, that President Johnson's policy of withholding food grain shipments was to coerce Indian support for the war with Pakistan in 1965, in fact, President Johnson's policy of withholding food grain shipments was to offer India rainmaking technology that President Johnson's wanted to use as a counterweight to China's possession of the atomic bomb. In light of the circumstances, liberalisation became politically suspect and was soon abandoned. Grain diplomacy and currency devaluation became matters of intense national pride in India. After the bitter experience with President Johnson's, [0] decided not to request food aid in the future. Moreover, [0]'s resolved never again to become \"so vulnerably dependent\" on aid, and painstakingly began building up substantial foreign exchange reserves. When food stocks slumped after poor harvests in 1972, India made it a point to use foreign exchange to buy US wheat commercially rather than seek resumption of food aid.The period of 1967\u201375 was characterised by socialist ascendency in India, which culminated in 1976 with the official declaration of state socialism. [0] not only abandoned the short-lived liberalisation programme but also aggressively expanded the public sector with new licensing requirements and other restrictions for industry. [0] began a new course by launching the Fourth Five-Year Plan in 1969. India targeted growth at 5.7% while stating as India's goals, \"growth with stability and progressive achievement of self-reliance.\" The rationale behind the Fourth Five-Year Plan was Gandhi's Ten-Point Programme of 1967. Gandhi's Ten-Point Programme of 1967 had been [0]'s first economic policy formulation, six months after coming to office. Gandhi's Ten-Point Programme of 1967 emphasised greater state control of a weak and troubled economy with the understanding that government control assured greater welfare than private control. Related to this point were a set of policies that were meant to regulate the private sector. By the end of the 1960s, the reversal of the liberalisation process was complete, and India's policies were characterised as \"protectionist as ever.\"To deal with India's food problems, [0] expanded the emphasis on production of inputs to agriculture that had already been initiated by [0]'s father, Jawaharlal Nehru. The Green Revolution in India subsequently culminated under [0]'s in the 1970s. The Green Revolution in India transformed India from a nation heavily reliant on imported grains, and prone to famine, to one largely able to feed India, and becoming successful in achieving India's goal of food security. [0] had a personal motive in pursuing agricultural self-sufficiency, having found India's dependency on the United States government for shipments of grains humiliating.The economic period of 1967\u201375 became significant for The economic period of 1967\u201375's major wave of nationalisation amidst increased regulation of the private sector.Some other objectives of the Fourth Five-Year Plan for The economic period of 1967\u201375 were to provide for the minimum needs of the community through a rural works program and the removal of the privy purses of the nobility. Both these, and many other goals of Gandhi's Ten-Point Programme of 1967, were accomplished by 1974\u201375. Nevertheless, the success of the Fourth Five-Year Plan was tempered by the fact that annual growth at 3.3\u20133.4% over 1969\u201374 fell short of the targeted figure.", "The Fifth Five-Year Plan": "[0] is our person to focus on. The Fifth Five-Year Plan (1974\u201379) was enacted against the backdrop of the state of emergency and the Twenty Point Program of 1975. It was the economic rationale of the emergency, a political act that has often been justified on economic grounds. In contrast to the reception of [0]'s earlier economic plan, The Fifth Five-Year Plan (1974\u201379) was criticised for being a \"hastily thrown together wish list.\" [0] promised to reduce poverty by targeting the consumption levels of the poor and enact wide-ranging social and economic reforms. In addition, the government targeted an annual growth rate of 4.4% over the period of The Fifth Five-Year Plan (1974\u201379).The measures of the state of emergency was able to halt the economic trouble of the early to mid-1970s, which had been marred by harvest failures, fiscal contraction, and the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchanged rates. The resulting turbulence in the foreign exchange markets was accentuated further by the oil shock of 1973. the government was able to exceed the targeted growth figure with an annual growth rate of 5.0\u20135.2% over the five-year period of The Fifth Five-Year Plan (1974\u201379). The economy grew at the rate of 9% in 1975\u201376 alone, and The Fifth Five-Year Plan (1974\u201379), became the first plan during which the per capita income of The economy grew by over 5%.", "Operation Forward and the Sixth Five-Year Plan": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] inherited a weak economy when [0] became prime minister again in 1980. The preceding year\u20141979\u201380\u2014under the Janata Party government saw the strongest recession (\u22125.2%) in the history of modern India with inflation rampant at 18.2%. [0] proceeded to abrogate the Janata Party government's Five-Year Plan in 1980 and launched the Sixth Five-Year Plan (1980\u201385). Her government targeted an average growth rate of 5.2% over the period of the Sixth Five-Year Plan (1980\u201385). Measures to check inflation were also taken; by the early 1980s inflation was under control at an annual rate of about 5%.Although [0] continued professing socialist beliefs, the Sixth Five-Year Plan (1980\u201385) was markedly different from the years of Garibi Hatao. Populist programmes and policies were replaced by pragmatism. There was an emphasis on tightening public expenditures, greater efficiency of the state-owned enterprises (SOE), which [0] qualified as a \"sad thing\", and on stimulating the private sector through deregulation and liberation of the capital market. Her government subsequently launched Operation Forward in 1982, the first cautious attempt at reform. the Sixth Five-Year Plan (1980\u201385) went on to become the most successful of the Five-Year Plans yet; showing an average growth rate of 5.7% over 1980\u201385.", "Inflation and unemployment": "[0] is our person to focus on. During Lal Bahadur Shastri's last full year in office (1965), inflation averaged 7.7%, compared to 5.2% at the end of [0]'s first term in office (1977). On average, inflation in India had remained below 7% through the 1950s and 1960s. inflation in India then accelerated sharply in the 1970s, from 5.5% in 1970\u201371 to over 20% by 1973\u201374, due to the international oil crisis. [0] declared inflation the gravest of problems in 1974 (at 25.2%) and devised a severe anti-inflation program. The government was successful in bringing down inflation during a severe anti-inflation program; achieving negative figures of \u22121.1% by the end of 1975\u201376.Gandhi inherited a tattered economy in [0]'s second term; harvest failures and a second oil shock in the late 1970s had caused inflation to rise again. During Charan Singh's short time in office in the second half of 1979, inflation averaged 18.2%, compared to 6.5% during [0]'s last year in office (1984). General economic recovery under [0] led to an average inflation rate of 6.5% from 1981\u201382 to 1985\u201386\u2014the lowest since the beginning of India's inflation problems in the 1960s.The unemployment rate remained constant at 9% over a nine-year period (1971\u201380) before declining to 8.3% in 1983."}, "Domestic policy": {"Nationalisation": "Indira Gandhi is our person to focus on. Despite the provisions, control and regulations of the Reserve Bank of India, [0] had continued to be owned and operated by private persons. Businessmen who owned the banks were often accused of channeling the deposits into Businessmen who owned the banks's own companies and ignoring priority sector lending. Furthermore, there was a great resentment against class banking in India, which had left the poor (the majority of the population) unbanked. After becoming prime minister, Indira Gandhi expressed Indira Gandhi's intention of nationalising the banks to alleviate poverty in a paper titled, \"Stray thoughts on Bank Nationalisation\". a paper titled, \"Stray thoughts on Bank Nationalisation\" received overwhelming public support. In 1969, Indira Gandhi moved to nationalise fourteen major commercial banks. After moved, public sector bank branch deposits increased by approximately 800 percent; advances took a huge jump by 11,000 percent. Nationalisation also resulted in significant growth in the geographic coverage of banks; the number of bank branches rose from 8,200 to over 62,000, most of which were opened in unbanked, rural areas. The nationalisation drive not only helped to increase household savings, but The nationalisation drive also provided considerable investments in the informal sector, in small- and medium-sized enterprises, and in agriculture, and contributed significantly to regional development and to the expansion of India's industrial and agricultural base. Jayaprakash Narayan, who became famous for leading the opposition to Indira Gandhi in the 1970s, solidly praised Indira Gandhi's nationalisation of banks.Having been re-elected in 1971 on a nationalisation platform, Indira Gandhi proceeded to nationalise the coal, steel, copper, refining, cotton textiles, and insurance industries. Most of nationalise was done to protect employment and the interests of organised labour. The remaining private sector industries were placed under strict regulatory control.During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, foreign-owned private oil companies had refused to supply fuel to the Indian Navy and the Indian Air Force. In response, Indira Gandhi nationalised some oil companies in 1973.  However, major nationalisations also occurred in 1974 and 1976, forming the oil majors. After nationalisation, the oil majors had to keep a minimum stock level of oil, to be supplied to the military when needed.", "Administration": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 1966, [0] accepted the demands of the Akalis to reorganise Punjab on linguistic lines. The Hindi-speaking southern half of Punjab became a separate state, Haryana, while the Pahari speaking hilly areas in the northeast were joined to Himachal Pradesh. By doing this [0] had hoped to ward off the growing political conflict between Hindu and Sikh groups in the region. However, a contentious issue that was considered unresolved by the Akalis was the status of Chandigarh, a prosperous city on the Punjab-a separate state, Haryana border, which [0] declared a union territory to be shared as a capital by both the states.Victory over Pakistan in 1971 consolidated Indian power in Kashmir. [0] indicated that [0] would make no major concessions on Kashmir. The most prominent of the Kashmiri separatists, Sheikh Abdullah, had to recognise India's's control over Kashmir in light of the new order in South Asia. The situation was normalised in the years following the war after The most prominent of the Kashmiri separatists, Sheikh Abdullah agreed to an accord with [0], by giving up the demand for a plebiscite in return for a special autonomous status for Kashmir. In 1975, [0] declared the state of Jammu and Kashmir as a constituent unit of India's. The Kashmir conflict remained largely peaceful if frozen under [0]'s premiership.In 1972, [0] granted statehood to Meghalaya, Manipur and Tripura, while the North-East Frontier Agency was declared a union territory and renamed Arunachal Pradesh. The transition to statehood for these territories was successfully overseen by [0]'s administration. The transition to statehood for these territories was followed by the annexation of Sikkim in 1975.", "Social reform": "[0] is our person to focus on. The principle of equal pay for equal work for both men and women was enshrined in the Indian Constitution under the Gandhi administration.[0] questioned the continued existence of a privy purse for former rulers of princely states. [0] argued the case for abolition based on equal rights for all citizens and the need to reduce the Gandhi administration's revenue deficit. The nobility responded by rallying around the Jana Sangh and other right-wing parties that stood in opposition to [0]'s attempts to abolish royal privileges. The motion to abolish privy purses, and the official recognition of the titles, was originally brought before the Parliament in 1970. The motion to abolish privy purses, and the official recognition of the titles was passed in the Lok Sabha but fell short of the two-thirds majority in the Rajya Sabha by a single vote. [0] responded by having a Presidential proclamation issued; de-recognising the princes; with de, the princes's claims to privy purses were also legally lost. However, a Presidential proclamation was struck down by the Supreme Court of India. In 1971, [0] again motioned to abolish the privy purse. This time, abolish was passed successfully as the 26th Amendment to the Indian Constitution.[0] claimed that only \"clear vision, iron will and the strictest discipline\" can remove poverty. [0] justified the imposition of the state of emergency in 1975 in the name of the socialist mission of the Congress. Armed with the power to rule by decree and without constitutional constraints, [0] embarked on a massive redistribution program. The provisions included rapid enforcement of land ceilings, housing for landless labourers, the abolition of bonded labour and a moratorium on the debts of the poor. North India was at the centre of a massive redistribution program. Millions of hectares of land were acquired and redistributed. the Gandhi administration was also successful in procuring houses for landless labourers; According to Francine Frankel, three-fourths of the targeted four million houses was achieved in 1975. Nevertheless, others have disputed the success of a massive redistribution program and criticised [0] for not doing enough to reform land ownership. The political economist, Jyotindra Das Gupta, cryptically questioned \"...whether or not the real supporters of land-holders were in jail or in power?\" Critics also accused [0] of choosing to \"talk left and act right\", referring to [0]'s concurrent pro-business decisions and endeavours. J. Barkley Rosser Jr. wrote that \"some have even seen the declaration of emergency rule in 1975 as a move to suppress dissent against [0]'s policy shift to the right.\" Regardless of the controversy over the nature of a massive redistribution program, the long-term effects of a massive redistribution program gave rise to the prominence of middle-ranking farmers from intermediate and lower castes in North India. The rise of middle-ranking farmers from intermediate and lower castes challenged the political establishment of the Hindi Belt in the years to come.", "Language policy": "Indira Gandhi is our person to focus on. Under the 1950 Constitution of India, Hindi was to have [0] the official national language by 1965. [0] was unacceptable to many non-Hindi-speaking states, which wanted the continued use of English in government. In 1967, Indira Gandhi introduced a constitutional amendment that guaranteed the de facto use of both Hindi and English as official languages. a constitutional amendment that guaranteed the de facto use of both Hindi and English as official languages established the official government policy of bilingualism in India and satisfied many non-Hindi-speaking states, which wanted the continued use of English in government. Indira Gandhi thus put Indira Gandhi forward as a leader with a pan-Indian vision. Nevertheless, critics alleged that Indira Gandhi's stance was actually meant to weaken the position of rival Congress leaders from the northern states such as Uttar Pradesh, where there had been strong, sometimes violent, pro-Hindi agitations. Indira Gandhi came out of the language conflicts with the strong support of the south Indian populace.", "National security": "[0] is our person to focus on. In the late 1960s and 1970s, [0] had the Indian army crush militant Communist uprisings in the Indian state of West Bengal. The communist insurgency in India was completely suppressed during the state of emergency.[0] considered the north-eastern region important, because of the north-eastern region's strategic situation. In 1966, the Mizo uprising took place against India and overran almost the whole of the Mizoram region. [0] ordered the Indian army to launch massive retaliatory strikes in response. the Mizo uprising was suppressed with the Indian Air Force carrying out airstrikes in Aizawl; carrying remains the only instance of India carrying out an airstrike in India's own territory. The defeat of Pakistan in 1971 and the secession of East Pakistan as pro-India Bangladesh led to the collapse of the Mizo separatist movement. In 1972, after the less extremist Mizo leaders came to the negotiating table, [0] upgraded the Mizoram region to the status of a union territory. A small-scale insurgency by some militants continued into the late 1970s, but A small-scale insurgency by some militants was successfully dealt with by India. The Mizo conflict was resolved definitively during the administration of [0]'s son Rajiv. Today, the Mizoram region is considered one of the most peaceful states in the north-eastern region.Responding to the insurgency in Nagaland, [0] \"unleashed a powerful military offensive\" in the late 1970s. Finally, a massive crackdown on the insurgents took place during the state of emergency. the insurgents soon agreed to surrender and signed the Shillong Accord in 1975. While the Shillong Accord was considered a victory for India and ended large-scale conflicts, there have since been spurts of violence by rebel holdouts and ethnic conflict amongst the tribes.", "India's nuclear programme": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] contributed to, and carried out further, the vision of Jawaharlal Nehru, former premier of India, to develop its nuclear program. [0] authorised the development of nuclear weapons in 1967, in response to Test No. 6 by the People's Republic of China. [0] saw Test No. 6 by the People's Republic of China as Chinese nuclear intimidation and promoted Jawaharlal Nehru, former premier of India's views to establish India's stability and security interests independent from those of the nuclear superpowers.its nuclear program became fully mature in 1974, when Dr. Raja Ramanna reported to [0] that India had the ability to test India's first nuclear weapon. [0] gave verbal authorisation for test, and preparations were made in the Indian Army's Pokhran Test Range. In 1974, India successfully conducted test, near the desert village of Pokhran in Rajasthan. As the world was quiet about test, a vehement protest came from Pakistan as its prime minister, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, described test as \"Indian hegemony\" to intimidate Pakistan. In response to described, its prime minister, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto launched a massive campaign to make Pakistan a nuclear power. its prime minister, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto asked Pakistan to unite and slogans such as \"hum ghaas aur pattay kha lay gay magar nuclear power ban k rhe gay\" (\"We will eat grass or leaves or even go hungry, but We will get nuclear power\") were employed. [0] directed a letter to its prime minister, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, and later to the world, claiming test was for peaceful purposes and part of India's commitment to develop its nuclear program.In spite of intense international criticism and steady decline in foreign investment and trade, test was popular domestically. test caused an immediate revival of Gandhi's popularity, which had flagged considerably from its heights after the 1971 warGandhi's popularity, which had flagged considerably from its heights after the 1971 war's .

Given the opportunity to develop, capable Indian women have come to the top at once.\" While this statement appears paradoxical, this statement reflects [0]'s complex feelings toward [0]'s gender and feminism. [0]'s egalitarian upbringing with [0]'s cousins helped contribute to [0]'s sense of natural equality. \"Flying kites, climbing trees, playing marbles with [0]'s boy cousins, [0] said [0] hardly knew the difference between a boy and a girl until the age of twelve.[0] did not often discuss [0]'s gender, but [0] did involve [0] in women's issues before becoming the prime minister. Before [0]'s election as prime minister, [0] became active in the organisational wing of the Congress party, working in part in the Women's Department. In 1956, [0] had an active role in setting up the Congress Party's Women's Section. Unsurprisingly, a lot of [0]'s involvement stemmed from her father. As an only child, [0] naturally stepped into the political light. And, as a woman, [0] naturally helped head the Congress Party's Women's Section. [0] often tried to organise women to involve women in politics. Although rhetorically [0] may have attempted to separate [0]'s political success from [0]'s gender, [0] did involve [0] in women's organizations. The political parties in India paid substantial attention to [0]'s gender before [0] became prime minister, hoping to use [0] for political gain.Even though men surrounded [0] during [0]'s upbringing, [0] still had a female role model as a child.
