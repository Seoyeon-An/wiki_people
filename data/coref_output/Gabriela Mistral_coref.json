Shortly after, [0]'s second love married someone else. These heartbreaks were reflected in [0]'s early poetry and gained recognition with [0]'s first published literary work in 1914, Sonetos de la muerte (\"Sonnets on Death\"). To protect [0]'s job as a teacher, [0] used a pen name, fearing the consequences of revealing [0]'s true identity. [0] won first prize in the national literary contest Juegos Florales held in Santiago, the capital of Chile. Exploring themes of death and life more broadly than previous Latin American poets, [0] expanded [0]'s poetic horizons. While [0] had passionate friendships with both men and women, which influenced [0]'s writing, [0] kept [0]'s emotional life private.Since June 1908, [0] had been using a pen name for most of [0]'s writing. After winning the national literary contest Juegos Florales held in Santiago, the capital of Chile, [0] rarely used [0] given name, Lucila Godoy, for [0]'s publications.

During [0]'s adolescence, the scarcity of trained teachers, especially in rural areas, allowed anyone willing to work to find employment as a teacher. However, [0] faced challenges in accessing good schools due to [0]'s lack of political and social connections. In 1907, [0] was rejected from the Normal School without explanation, which [0] later attributed to the Normal School's chaplain, Father Ignacio Munizaga, who was aware of [0]'s publications advocating for educational reform and increased access to schools for all social classes.Although [0]'s formal education ended in 1900, [0] secured teaching positions with the help of [0]'s older sister, Emelina, who had likewise begun as a teacher's aide and was responsible for much of [0]'s early education. Through [0]'s publications in local and national newspapers and magazines, as well as [0]'s willingness to relocate, [0] advanced from one teaching position to another.

There, [0] contributed to Mexico's plan to reform libraries and schools and establish a national education system.
