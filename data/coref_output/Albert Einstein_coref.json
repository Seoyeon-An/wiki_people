Best known for developing the theory of relativity, [0] also made important contributions to quantum mechanics, and was thus a central figure in the revolutionary reshaping of the scientific understanding of nature that modern physics accomplished in the first decades of the twentieth century. [0]'s mass\u2013energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been called \"the world's most famous equation\". [0] received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for [0]'s services to theoretical physics, and especially for [0]'s discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His work is also known for His work's influence on the philosophy of science. In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal Physics World, [0] was ranked the greatest physicist of all time. [0]'s intellectual achievements and originality have made the word Einstein broadly synonymous with genius.In 1905, a year sometimes described as [0]'s annus mirabilis (miracle year), [0] published four groundbreaking papers. four groundbreaking papers outlined a theory of the photoelectric effect, explained Brownian motion, introduced his special theory of relativity\u2014a theory which addressed the inability of classical mechanics to account satisfactorily for the behavior of the electromagnetic field\u2014and demonstrated that if his special theory of relativity\u2014a theory which addressed the inability of classical mechanics to account satisfactorily for the behavior of the electromagnetic field is correct, mass and energy are equivalent to each other. In 1915, [0] proposed a general theory of relativity that extended his system of mechanics to incorporate gravitation. A cosmological paper that [0] published the following year laid out the implications of a general theory of relativity that extended his system of mechanics to incorporate gravitation for the modeling of the structure and evolution of the universe as a whole. The middle part of [0]'s career also saw [0] making important contributions to statistical mechanics and quantum theory. Especially notable was [0]'s work on the quantum physics of radiation, in which light consists of particles, subsequently called photons.For much of the last phase of his academic life, [0] worked on two endeavors that proved ultimately unsuccessful. Firstly, [0] fought a long rearguard action against quantum theory's introduction of fundamental randomness into science's picture of the world, objecting that \"God does not play dice\". Secondly, [0] attempted to devise a unified field theory by generalizing [0]'s geometric theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism too. As a result, [0] became increasingly isolated from the mainstream of modern physics.Born in the German Empire, [0] moved to Switzerland in 1895, forsaking [0]'s German citizenship (as a subject of the Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg)[note 1] the following year. In 1897, at the age of seventeen, [0] enrolled in the mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Swiss Federal polytechnic school in Z\u00fcrich, graduating in 1900. In 1901, [0] acquired Swiss citizenship, which [0] kept for the rest of his academic life. In 1903, [0] secured a permanent position at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern. In 1905, [0] submitted a successful PhD dissertation to the Swiss Federal polytechnic school in Z\u00fcrich. In 1914, [0] moved to Berlin in order to join the Prussian Academy of Sciences and the Humboldt University of Berlin. In 1917, [0] became director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics; [0] also became a German citizen again, this time as a subject of the Kingdom of Prussia.[note 1] In 1933, while [0] was visiting the United States, Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany. Horrified by the Nazi \"war of extermination\" against [0]'s fellow Jews, [0] decided to remain in the United States, and was granted American citizenship in 1940. On the eve of World War II, [0] endorsed a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt alerting President Franklin D. Roosevelt to the potential German nuclear weapons program and recommending that the United States begin similar research. [0] supported the Allies but generally viewed the idea of nuclear weapons with great dismay."}, "Life and career": {"Childhood, youth and education": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was born in Ulm, in the Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg in the German Empire, on 14 March 1879. His parents, secular Ashkenazi Jews, were Hermann Einstein, a salesman and engineer, and Pauline Koch. In 1880, the family moved to Munich, where Hermann Einstein, a salesman and engineer, and [0]'s uncle Jakob founded Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie, a company that manufactured electrical equipment based on direct current.[0] attended a Catholic elementary school in Ulm, in the Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg in the German Empire, from the age of five. When [0] was eight, [0] was transferred to the Luitpold-Gymnasium (now known as the Albert-Einstein-Gymnasium) where [0] received advanced primary and then secondary school education.In 1894, His parents, secular Ashkenazi Jews,'s tendered for a contract to install electric lighting in Ulm, in the Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg in the German Empire,, but without success\u2014Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie lacked the capital that would have been required to update Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie's technology from direct current to the more efficient, alternating current alternative. The failure of Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie's forced Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie to sell Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie's Ulm, in the Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg in the German Empire, factory and search for new opportunities elsewhere. the family moved to Italy, first to Milan and a few months later to Pavia, where they settled in Palazzo Cornazzani. [0] stayed behind in Ulm, in the Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg in the German Empire, in order to finish [0]'s schooling. Hermann Einstein, a salesman and engineer, wanted [0] to study electrical engineering, but [0] was a fractious pupil who found the Luitpold-Gymnasium (now known as the Albert-Einstein-Gymnasium)'s regimen and teaching methods far from congenial. [0] later wrote that the Luitpold-Gymnasium (now known as the Albert-Einstein-Gymnasium)'s policy of strict rote learning was harmful to creativity. At the end of December 1894, a letter from a doctor persuaded the Luitpold-Gymnasium (now known as the Albert-Einstein-Gymnasium)'s authorities to release [0] from the Luitpold-Gymnasium (now known as the Albert-Einstein-Gymnasium)'s care, and [0] joined the family in Pavia, where they settled in Palazzo Cornazzani. While in Italy as a teenager, [0] wrote an essay entitled \"On the Investigation of the State of the Ether in a Magnetic Field\".[0] excelled at physics and mathematics from an early age, and soon acquired the mathematical expertise normally only found in a child several years [0]'s senior. [0] began teaching [0] algebra, calculus and Euclidean geometry when [0] was twelve; [0] made such rapid progress that [0] discovered an original proof of the Pythagorean theorem before [0]'s thirteenth birthday. A family tutor, Max Talmud, said that only a short time after A family tutor, Max Talmud, had given [0] a geometry textbook, [0] \"had worked through a geometry textbook. [0] thereupon devoted [0] to higher mathematics\u00a0... Soon the flight of [0]'s mathematical genius was so high A family tutor, Max Talmud, could not follow.\" [0] recorded that [0] had \"mastered integral and differential calculus\" while still just fourteen. [0]'s love of algebra and geometry was so great that at twelve, [0] was already confident that nature could be understood as a \"mathematical structure\".At thirteen, when [0]'s range of enthusiasms had broadened to include music and philosophy, [0] was introduced to Kant's's Critique of Pure Reason. Kant's became [0]'s favorite philosopher; according to A family tutor, Max Talmud,, \"At the time [0] was still a child, only thirteen years old, yet Kant's's works, incomprehensible to ordinary mortals, seemed to be clear to [0].\"In 1895, at the age of sixteen, [0] sat the entrance examination for the Federal polytechnic school (later the Eidgen\u00f6ssische Technische Hochschule, ETH) in Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland. [0] failed to reach the required standard in the general part of the entrance examination for the Federal polytechnic school (later the Eidgen\u00f6ssische Technische Hochschule, ETH) in Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland, but performed with distinction in physics and mathematics. On the advice of the Federal polytechnic school (later the Eidgen\u00f6ssische Technische Hochschule, ETH) in Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland's principal, [0] completed [0]'s secondary education at the Argovian cantonal school (a gymnasium) in Aarau, Switzerland, graduating in 1896. While lodging in Aarau, Switzerland with the family of Jost Winteler, [0] fell in love with Winteler's daughter, Marie. ([0]'s sister, Maja, later married Jost Winteler's son Paul.)In January 1896, with Hermann Einstein, a salesman and engineer,'s approval, [0] renounced [0]'s citizenship of the Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg in the German Empire in order to avoid conscription into military service. The Matura (graduation for the successful completion of higher secondary schooling) awarded to [0] in the September of 1896 acknowledged [0] to have performed well across most of the curriculum, allotting [0] a top grade of 6 for history, physics, algebra, geometry, and descriptive geometry. At seventeen, [0] enrolled in the four-year mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Federal polytechnic school (later the Eidgen\u00f6ssische Technische Hochschule, ETH) in Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland. Winteler's daughter, Marie took up a teaching post in Olsberg, Switzerland.The five other the Federal polytechnic school (later the Eidgen\u00f6ssische Technische Hochschule, ETH) in Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland freshmen following the same course as [0] included just one woman, a twenty year old Serbian, Mileva Mari\u0107. Over the next few years, the pair spent many hours discussing the pair's shared interests and learning about topics in physics that the Federal polytechnic school (later the Eidgen\u00f6ssische Technische Hochschule, ETH) in Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland's lectures did not cover. In [0]'s letters to just one woman, a twenty year old Serbian, Mileva Mari\u0107, [0] confessed that exploring science with just one woman, a twenty year old Serbian, Mileva Mari\u0107 by [0]'s side was much more enjoyable than reading a textbook in solitude. Eventually the pair became not only friends but also lovers.Historians of physics are divided on the question of the extent to which just one woman, a twenty year old Serbian, Mileva Mari\u0107 contributed to the insights of [0]'s annus mirabilis publications. There is at least some evidence that [0] was influenced by just one woman, a twenty year old Serbian, Mileva Mari\u0107's scientific ideas, but there are scholars who doubt whether just one woman, a twenty year old Serbian, Mileva Mari\u0107's impact on [0]'s thought was of any great significance at all.", "Marriages, relationships and children": "[0] is our person to focus on. Correspondence between Einstein and Mari\u0107, discovered and published in 1987, revealed that in early 1902, while Mari\u0107 was visiting Mari\u0107's parents in Novi Sad, Mari\u0107 gave birth to a daughter, Lieserl. When Mari\u0107 returned to Switzerland returned was without a daughter, Lieserl. A letter of [0]'s that [0] wrote in September 1903 suggests that a daughter, Lieserl was either given up for adoption or died of scarlet fever in infancy.Einstein and Mari\u0107 married in January 1903. In May 1904, their son Hans Albert was born in Bern, Switzerland. Their son Eduard was born in Z\u00fcrich in July 1910. In letters that [0] wrote to Marie Winteler in the months before Their son Eduard's arrival, [0] described [0]'s love for [0]'s as \"misguided\" and mourned the \"missed life\" that [0] imagined [0] would have enjoyed if [0] had married Marie Winteler instead: \"[0] think of Marie Winteler in heartfelt love every spare minute and am so unhappy as only a man can be.\"In 1912, [0] entered into a relationship with Elsa L\u00f6wenthal, who was both his first cousin on his mother's side and his second cousin on his father's's. When Mari\u0107 learned of [0]'s infidelity soon after moving to Berlin with [0] in April 1914, Mari\u0107 returned to Z\u00fcrich, taking their son Hans Albert and Their son Eduard with Mari\u0107. Einstein and Mari\u0107 were granted a divorce on 14 February 1919 on the grounds of having lived apart for five years. As part of a divorce, [0] agreed that if [0] were to win a Nobel Prize, [0] would give the money that [0] received to Mari\u0107; Mari\u0107 had to wait only two years before Mari\u0107's foresight in extracting this promise from [0] was rewarded.[0] married Elsa L\u00f6wenthal, who was both his first cousin on his mother's side and his second cousin on his father's in 1919. In 1923, [0] began a relationship with a secretary named Betty Neumann, the niece of [0]'s close friend Hans M\u00fchsam. Elsa L\u00f6wenthal, who was both his first cousin on his mother's side and his second cousin on his father's nevertheless remained loyal to [0], accompanying [0] when [0] emigrated to the United States in 1933. In 1935, Elsa L\u00f6wenthal, who was both his first cousin on his mother's side and his second cousin on his father's was diagnosed with heart and kidney problems. Elsa L\u00f6wenthal, who was both his first cousin on his mother's side and his second cousin on his father's died in December 1936.A volume of [0]'s letters released by Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 2006 added further names to the catalog of women with whom [0] was romantically involved. further names included Margarete Lebach (a blonde Austrian), Estella Katzenellenbogen (the rich owner of a florist business), Toni Mendel (a wealthy Jewish widow) and Ethel Michanowski (a Berlin socialite), with whom [0] spent time and from whom [0] accepted gifts while married to Elsa L\u00f6wenthal, who was both his first cousin on his mother's side and his second cousin on his father's. After being widowed, [0] was briefly in a relationship with Margarita Konenkova, thought by some to be a Russian spy; Margarita Konenkova, thought by some to be a Russian spy's husband, the Russian sculptor Sergei Konenkov, created the bronze bust of [0] at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton.[failed verification]Following an episode of acute mental illness at about the age of twenty, Their son Eduard was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Their son Eduard spent the remainder of Their son Eduard's life either in the care of Their son Eduard's or in temporary confinement in an asylum. After his mother's death, Their son Eduard was committed permanently to Burgh\u00f6lzli, the Psychiatric University Hospital in Z\u00fcrich.", "1902\u20131909: Assistant at the Swiss Patent Office": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] graduated from the Federal polytechnic school in 1900, duly certified as competent to teach mathematics and physics. [0]'s successful acquisition of Swiss citizenship in February 1901 was not followed by the usual sequel of conscription; the Swiss authorities deemed [0] medically unfit for military service. [0] found that Swiss schools too appeared to have no use for [0], failing to offer [0] a teaching position despite the almost two years that [0] spent applying for one. Eventually it was with the help of Marcel Grossmann's father that [0] secured a post in Bern at the Swiss Patent Office, as an assistant examiner \u2013 level III.Patent applications that landed on [0]'s desk for [0]'s evaluation included ideas for a gravel sorter and an electric typewriter. His employers were pleased enough with [0]'s work to make [0]'s position permanent in 1903, although His employers did not think that [0] should be promoted until [0] had \"fully mastered machine technology\". It is conceivable that [0]'s labors at the Swiss Patent Office had a bearing on [0]'s development of [0]'s special theory of relativity. [0] arrived at [0]'s revolutionary ideas about space, time and light through thought experiments about the transmission of signals and the synchronization of clocks, matters which also figured in some of the inventions submitted to [0] for assessment.In 1902, Einstein and some friends whom he had met in Bern formed a group that held regular meetings to discuss science and philosophy. Einstein and some friends whom he had met in Bern's choice of a name for a group that held regular meetings to discuss science and philosophy, the Olympia Academy, was an ironic comment upon a group that held regular meetings to discuss science and philosophy's far from Olympian status. Sometimes Einstein and some friends whom he had met in Bern were joined by Mari\u0107, who limited her participation in their proceedings to careful listeningMari\u0107, who limited her participation in their proceedings to careful listening's . The thinkers whose works Einstein and some friends whom he had met in Bern reflected upon included Henri Poincar\u00e9, Ernst Mach and David Hume, all of whom significantly influenced [0]'s own subsequent ideas and beliefs.", "1900\u20131905: First scientific papers": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0]'s first paper, \"Folgerungen aus den Capillarit\u00e4tserscheinungen\" (\"Conclusions drawn from the phenomena of capillarity\"), in which [0] proposed a model of intermolecular attraction that [0] afterwards disavowed as worthless, was published in the journal Annalen der Physik in 1900. His 24-page doctoral dissertation also addressed a topic in molecular physics. Titled \"Eine neue Bestimmung der Molek\u00fcldimensionen\" (\"A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions\") and dedicated to [0]'s friend Marcel Grossman, His 24-page doctoral dissertation was completed on 30 April 1905 and approved by Professor Alfred Kleiner of the University of Zurich three months later. ([0] was formally awarded [0]'s PhD on 15 January 1906.) Four other pieces of work that [0] completed in 1905\u2014[0]'s famous papers on the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, [0]'s special theory of relativity and the equivalence of mass and energy\u2014have led to 1905's being celebrated as an annus mirabilis for physics almost as wonderful as 1666 (the year in which Isaac Newton experienced Isaac Newton's greatest epiphanies). The publications deeply impressed [0]'s contemporaries.", "1908\u20131933: Early academic career": "[0] is our person to focus on. Einstein's sabbatical as a civil servant approached Einstein's sabbatical as a civil servant's end in 1908, when [0] secured a junior teaching position at the University of Bern. In 1909, a lecture on relativistic electrodynamics that [0] gave at the University of Zurich, much admired by Alfred Kleiner, led to the University of Zurich's luring [0] away from the University of Bern with a newly created associate professorship. Promotion to a full professorship followed in April 1911, when [0] accepted a chair at the German Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague, a move which required [0] to become an Austrian citizen of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. [0]'s time in Prague saw [0] producing eleven research papers.In July 1912, [0] returned to the University of Zurich to take up a chair in theoretical physics. [0]'s teaching activities there centred on thermodynamics and analytical mechanics, and [0]'s research interests included the molecular theory of heat, continuum mechanics and the development of a relativistic theory of gravitation. In [0]'s work on a relativistic theory of gravitation, [0] was assisted by [0]'s friend, Marcel Grossmann, whose knowledge of the kind of mathematics required was greater than [0]'s own.In the spring of 1913, two German visitors, Max Planck and Walther Nernst, called upon [0] in the University of Zurich in the hope of persuading [0] to relocate to Berlin. two German visitors, Max Planck and Walther Nernst, offered [0] membership of the Prussian Academy of Sciences, the directorship of the planned Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics and a chair at the Humboldt University of Berlin that would allow him to pursue his research supported by a professorial salary but with no teaching duties to burden him. two German visitors, Max Planck and Walther Nernst,'s was all the more appealing to [0] because Berlin happened to be the home of [0]'s latest girlfriend, Elsa L\u00f6wenthal. [0] duly joined the Prussian Academy of Sciences on 24July 1913, and moved into an apartment in the Berlin district of Dahlem on 1 April 1914. [0] was installed in a chair at the Humboldt University of Berlin that would allow him to pursue his research supported by a professorial salary but with no teaching duties to burden him shortly thereafter.The outbreak of the First World War in July 1914 marked the beginning of [0]'s gradual estrangement from the nation of [0]'s birth. When the \"Manifesto of the Ninety-Three\" was published in October 1914\u2014a document signed by a host of prominent German thinkers that justified Germany's belligerence\u2014[0] was one of the few German intellectuals to distance [0] from the \"Manifesto of the Ninety-Three\" and sign the alternative, eirenic \"Manifesto to the Europeans\" instead. But this expression of [0]'s doubts about German policy did not prevent [0] from being elected to a two-year term as president of the German Physical Society in 1916. And when the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics opened the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics's doors the following year\u2014the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics's foundation delayed because of the First World War\u2014[0] was appointed the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics's first director, just as Max Planck and Walther Nernst had promised.[0] was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1920, and a Foreign Member of the Royal Society in 1921. In 1922, [0] was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for [0]'s services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for [0]'s discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\". At this point some physicists still regarded the general theory of relativity sceptically, and the Nobel citation the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics displayed a degree of doubt even about the work on photoelectricity that the Nobel citation acknowledged: the Nobel citation did not assent to [0]'s notion of the particulate nature of light, which only won over the entire scientific community when S. N. Bose derived the Max Planck spectrum in 1924. 1922, [0] was elected an International Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Britain's closest equivalent of the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics, the Royal Society's Copley Medal, was not hung around [0]'s neck until 1925. [0] was elected an International Member of the American Philosophical Society in [0] resigned from the Prussian Academy of Sciences in March 1933. [0]'s accomplishments in Berlin had included the completion of the general theory of relativity, proving the [0]\u2013de Haas effect, contributing to the quantum theory of radiation, and the development of Bose\u2013[0] statistics.", "1919: Putting general relativity to the test": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 1907, [0] reached a milestone on [0]'s long journey from [0]'s special theory of relativity to a new idea of gravitation with the formulation of [0]'s equivalence principle, which asserts that an observer in an infinitesimally small box falling freely in a gravitational field would be unable to find any evidence that a gravitational field exists. In 1911, [0] used the principle to estimate the amount by which a ray of light from a distant star would be bent by the gravitational pull of the Sun as a ray of light from a distant star passed close to the Sun's photosphere (that is, the Sun's apparent surface). [0] reworked [0]'s in 1913, having now found a way to model gravitation with the Riemann curvature tensor of a non-Euclidean four-dimensional spacetime. By the fall of 1915, [0]'s reimagining of the mathematics of gravitation in terms of Riemannian geometry was complete, and [0] applied his new theory not just to the behavior of the Sun as a gravitational lens but also to another astronomical phenomenon, the precession of the perihelion of Mercury (a slow drift in the point in Mercury's elliptical orbit at which Mercury approaches the Sun most closely). A total eclipse of the Sun that took place on 29 May 1919 provided an opportunity to put his new theory to the test, and observations performed by Sir Arthur Eddington yielded results that were consistent with [0]'s calculations. Sir Arthur Eddington's work was reported at length in newspapers around the world. On 7 November 1919, for example, the leading British newspaper, The Times, printed a banner headline that read: \"Revolution in Science\u00a0\u2013 New Theory of the Universe\u00a0\u2013 Newtonian Ideas Overthrown\".", "1921\u20131923: Coming to terms with fame": "[0] is our person to focus on. With Eddington's eclipse observations widely reported not just in academic journals but by the popular press as well, [0] became \"perhaps the world's's first celebrity scientist\", a genius who had shattered a paradigm that had been basic to physicists' understanding of the universe since the seventeenth century.[0] began [0]'s new life as an intellectual icon in America, where [0] arrived on 2 April 1921. [0] was welcomed to New York City by Mayor John Francis Hylan, and then spent three weeks giving lectures and attending receptions. [0] spoke several times at Columbia University and Princeton, and in Washington, [0] visited the White House with representatives of the National Academy of Sciences. [0] returned to Europe via London, where he was the guest of the philosopher and statesman Viscount Haldane. [0] used [0]'s time in London, where he was the guest of the philosopher and statesman Viscount Haldane to meet several people prominent in British scientific, political or intellectual life, and to deliver a lecture at King's College. In July 1921, [0] published an essay, \"[0]'s First Impression of the U.S.A.\", in which [0] sought to sketch the American character, much as had Alexis de Tocqueville in Democracy in the U.S.A. (1835). [0] wrote of [0]'s transatlantic hosts in highly approving terms: \"What strikes a visitor is the joyous, positive attitude to life ... The American is friendly, self-confident, optimistic, and without envy.\"In 1922, [0]'s travels were to the old world rather than the new. [0] devoted six months to a tour of Asia that saw [0] speaking in Japan, Singapore and Sri Lanka (then known as Ceylon). After [0]'s first public lecture in Tokyo, [0] met Emperor Yoshihito and Emperor Yoshihito's wife at the Imperial Palace, with thousands of spectators thronging the streets in the hope of catching a glimpse of [0]. (In a letter to [0]'s sons, [0] wrote that Japanese people seemed to [0] to be generally modest, intelligent and considerate, and to have a true appreciation of art. But [0]'s picture of Japanese people in his diary was less flattering: \"[the] intellectual needs of Japan seem to be weaker than Japanese people's artistic ones \u2013 natural disposition?\" his diary also contains views of China and India which were uncomplimentary. Of Chinese people, [0] wrote that \"even the children are spiritless and look obtuse... It would be a pity if Chinese people supplant all other races. For the likes of us the mere thought is unspeakably dreary\".) [0] was greeted with even greater enthusiasm on the last leg of [0]'s tour, in which [0] spent twelve days in Mandatory Palestine, newly entrusted to British rule by the League of Nations in the aftermath of the First World War. Sir Herbert Samuel, the British High Commissioner, welcomed [0] with a degree of ceremony normally only accorded to a visiting head of state, including a cannon salute. One reception held in [0]'s honor was stormed by people determined to hear him speak: [0] told people determined to hear him speak that [0] was happy that Jews were beginning to be recognized as a force in the world's.[0]'s decision to tour the eastern hemisphere in 1922 meant that [0] was unable to go to Stockholm in the December of 1922 to participate in the Nobel prize ceremony. [0]'s place at the traditional Nobel banquet was taken by a German diplomat, who gave a speech praising [0] not only as a physicist but also as a campaigner for peace. A two week visit to Spain that [0] undertook in 1923 saw [0] collecting another award, a membership of the Spanish Academy of Sciences signified by a diploma handed to [0] by King Alfonso XIII.

From 1922 until 1932, with the exception of a few months in 1923 and 1924, [0] was a member of the Geneva-based International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation of the League of Nations, a group set up by the League of Nations to encourage scientists, artists, scholars, teachers and other people engaged in the life of the mind to work more closely with scientists, artists, scholars, teachers and other people engaged in the life of the mind's counterparts in other countries. [0] was appointed as a German delegate rather than as a representative of Switzerland because of the machinations of two Catholic activists, Oskar Halecki and Giuseppe Motta. By persuading Secretary General Eric Drummond to deny [0] the place on the Geneva-based International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation of the League of Nations reserved for a Swiss thinker, two Catholic activists, Oskar Halecki and Giuseppe Motta created an opening for Gonzague de Reynold, who used his League of Nations position as a platform from which to promote traditional Catholic doctrineGonzague de Reynold, who used his League of Nations position as a platform from which to promote traditional Catholic doctrine .

But [0] remained willing to allow his fans at least some of the time with [0] that his fans requested.After arriving in New York City, [0] was taken to various places and events, including Chinatown, a lunch with the editors of The New York Times, and a performance of Carmen at the Metropolitan Opera, where [0] was cheered by the audience on [0]'s arrival. During the days following, [0] was given the keys to New York City by Mayor Jimmy Walker and met the president of Columbia University, who described [0] as \"the ruling monarch of the mind\". Harry Emerson Fosdick, pastor at New York's Riverside Church, gave [0] a tour of New York's Riverside Church and showed [0] a full-size statue that New York's Riverside Church made of [0], standing at the entrance. Also during [0]'s stay in New York City, [0] joined a crowd of 15,000 people at Madison Square Garden during a Hanukkah celebration.[0] next traveled to California, where [0] met Caltech president and Nobel laureate Robert A. Millikan. [0]'s friendship with Caltech president and Nobel laureate Robert A. Millikan was \"awkward\", as Caltech president and Nobel laureate Robert A. Millikan \"had a penchant for patriotic militarism\", where [0] was a pronounced pacifist. During an address to the California Institute of Technology's students, [0] noted that science was often inclined to do more harm than good.This aversion to war also led [0] to befriend author Upton Sinclair and film star Charlie Chaplin, both noted for their pacifismauthor Upton Sinclair and film star Charlie Chaplin, both noted for their pacifism's . Carl Laemmle, head of Universal Studios, gave [0] a tour of Carl Laemmle, head of Universal Studios,'s studio and introduced [0] to film star Charlie Chaplin. They had an instant rapport, with film star Charlie Chaplin inviting Einstein and his wife, Elsa, to film star Charlie Chaplin's home for dinner. film star Charlie Chaplin said [0]'s outward persona, calm and gentle, seemed to conceal a \"highly emotional temperament\", from which came [0]'s \"extraordinary intellectual energy\".film star Charlie Chaplin's film, City Lights, was to premiere a few days later in Hollywood, and film star Charlie Chaplin invited Einstein and his wife, Elsa, to join film star Charlie Chaplin as film star Charlie Chaplin's special guests. Walter Isaacson, [0]'s biographer, described join as \"one of the most memorable scenes in the new era of celebrity\". film star Charlie Chaplin visited [0] at [0]'s home on a later trip to Berlin and recalled [0]'s \"modest little flat\" and the piano at which he had begun writing his theory. film star Charlie Chaplin speculated that the piano at which he had begun writing his theory was \"possibly used as kindling wood by the Nazis\".", "1933: Emigration to the US": "[0] is our person to focus on. In February 1933, while on a visit to the United States, [0] knew [0] could not return to Germany with the rise to power of the Nazis under Germany's new chancellor, Adolf Hitler.While at American universities in early 1933, [0] undertook [0]'s third two-month visiting professorship at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. In February 1933 and March 1933, the Gestapo repeatedly raided [0]'s family's apartment in Berlin. He and his wife Elsa returned to Europe in March 1933, and during the trip, He and his wife Elsa learned that the German Reichstag had passed the Enabling Act on 23 March, transforming Germany's new chancellor, Adolf Hitler's into a de facto legal dictatorship, and that He and his wife Elsa would not be able to proceed to Berlin. Later on, He and his wife Elsa heard that He and his wife Elsa's had been raided by the Nazis and Einstein's personal sailboat confiscated. Upon landing in Antwerp, Belgium on 28 March, [0] immediately went to the German consulate and surrendered [0]'s passport, formally renouncing [0]'s German citizenship. the Nazis later sold Einstein's personal sailboat and converted their cottage into a Germany's new chancellor, Adolf Hitler Youth camp.In April 1933, [0] discovered that Hitler's government had passed laws barring Jews from holding any official positions, including teaching at universities. Historian Gerald Holton describes how, with \"virtually no audible protest being raised by their's colleagues\", their were suddenly forced to give up their's university positions and their's names were removed from the rolls of institutions where their were employed.A month later, [0]'s works were among those targeted by the German Student Union in the Nazi book burnings, with Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels proclaiming, \"Jewish intellectualism is dead.\" One German magazine included [0] in a list of enemies of Hitler's government with the phrase, \"not yet hanged\", offering a $5,000 bounty on [0]'s head. In a subsequent letter to physicist and friend Max Born, who had already emigrated from Germany to England, [0] wrote, \"...\u00a0[0] must confess that the degree of the Nazis's brutality and cowardice came as something of a surprise.\" After moving to the United States, [0] described the Nazi book burnings as a \"spontaneous emotional outburst\" by those who \"shun popular enlightenment\", and \"more than anything else in the world, fear the influence of men of intellectual independence\".[0] was now without a permanent home, unsure where [0] would live and work, and equally worried about the fate of countless other scientists still in Germany. Aided by the Academic Assistance Council, founded in April 1933 by British Liberal politician William Beveridge to help academics escape Nazi persecution, [0] was able to leave Germany. [0] rented a house in De Haan, Belgium, where [0] lived for a few months. In late July 1933, [0] visited England for about six weeks at the invitation of the British Member of Parliament Commander Oliver Locker-Lampson, who had become friends with him in the preceding years. the British Member of Parliament Commander Oliver Locker-Lampson, who had become friends with him in the preceding years invited [0] to stay near the British Member of Parliament Commander Oliver Locker-Lampson, who had become friends with him in the preceding years's Cromer home in a secluded wooden cabin on Roughton Heath in the Parish of Roughton, Norfolk. To protect [0], the British Member of Parliament Commander Oliver Locker-Lampson, who had become friends with him in the preceding years had two bodyguards watch over [0]; a photo of two bodyguards carrying shotguns and guarding [0] was published in the Daily Herald on 24 July 1933.Locker-Lampson took [0] to meet Winston Churchill at the British Member of Parliament Commander Oliver Locker-Lampson, who had become friends with him in the preceding years's home, and later, Austen Chamberlain and former Prime Minister Lloyd George. [0] asked them to help bring Jewish scientists out of Germany. British historian Martin Gilbert notes that Winston Churchill responded immediately, and sent Winston Churchill's friend, physicist Frederick Lindemann, to Germany to seek out Jewish scientists and place Jewish scientists in British universities. Winston Churchill later observed that as a result of Germany having driven the Jews out, Germany had lowered Germany's \"technical standards\" and put the Allies' technology ahead of Germany.[0] later contacted leaders of other nations, including Turkey's's Prime Minister, \u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc, to whom [0] wrote in September 1933 requesting placement of unemployed German-Jewish scientists. As a result of [0]'s letter, Jewish invitees to Turkey's eventually totaled over \"1,000 saved individuals\".the British Member of Parliament Commander Oliver Locker-Lampson, who had become friends with him in the preceding years also submitted a bill to Parliament to extend British citizenship to [0], during which period [0] made a number of public appearances describing the crisis brewing in Europe. In one of his speeches [0] denounced Germany's treatment of Jews, while at the same time [0] introduced a bill promoting Jewish citizenship in Palestine, as Jews were being denied citizenship elsewhere. In one of his speeches [0] described [0] as a \"citizen of the world\" who should be offered a temporary shelter in the UK.[note 3] Both bills failed, however, and [0] then accepted an earlier offer from the Institute for Advanced Study, in Princeton, New Jersey, US, to become a resident scholar.On 3 October 1933, [0] delivered a speech on the importance of academic freedom before a packed audience at the Royal Albert Hall in London, with The Times reporting [0] was wildly cheered throughout. Four days later [0] returned to the United States and took up a position at the Institute for Advanced Study, in Princeton, New Jersey, US,. At the time, most American universities, including Harvard, Princeton and Yale, had minimal or no Jewish faculty or students, as a result of most American universities, including Harvard, Princeton and Yale,'s Jewish quotas, which lasted until the late 1940s.[0] was still undecided on [0]'s future. [0] had offers from several European universities, including Christ Church, Oxford, where [0] stayed for three short periods between May 1931 and June 1933 and was offered a five-year research fellowship (called a \"studentship\" at Christ Church), but in 1935, [0] arrived at the decision to remain permanently in the United States and apply for citizenship.[0]'s affiliation with the Institute for Advanced Study, in Princeton, New Jersey, US, would last until [0]'s death in 1955. [0] was one of the four first selected (along with John von Neumann, Kurt G\u00f6del, and Hermann Weyl) at the Institute for Advanced Study, in Princeton, New Jersey, US,. [0] soon developed a close friendship with Kurt G\u00f6del; the two would take long walks together discussing the two's work. Bruria Kaufman, [0]'s assistant, later became a physicist. During this period, [0] tried to develop a unified field theory and to refute the accepted interpretation of quantum physics, both unsuccessfully. [0] lived in Princeton, New Jersey, US at his home from 1935 onwards. his home was made a National Historic Landmark in 1976.In 1939, a group of Hungarian scientists that included \u00e9migr\u00e9 physicist Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd attempted to alert the United States to ongoing Nazi atomic bomb research. a group of Hungarian scientists that included \u00e9migr\u00e9 physicist Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd's warnings were discounted. Einstein and Szil\u00e1rd, along with other refugees such as Edward Teller and Eugene Wigner, \"regarded it as Einstein and Szil\u00e1rd, along with other refugees such as Edward Teller and Eugene Wigner's responsibility to alert Americans to the possibility that German scientists might win the race to build an atomic bomb, and to warn that Germany's new chancellor, Adolf Hitler would be more than willing to resort to such a weapon.\" To make certain the United States was aware of the possibility that German scientists might win the race to build an atomic bomb, in July 1939, a few months before the beginning of World War II in Europe, \u00e9migr\u00e9 physicist Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd and Eugene Wigner visited [0] to explain the possibility of atomic bombs, which [0] said [0] had never considered. [0] was asked to lend [0]'s support by writing a letter, with Szil\u00e1rd, to President Roosevelt, recommending the US pay attention and engage in its own nuclear weapons research.a letter, with Szil\u00e1rd, to President Roosevelt, recommending the US pay attention and engage in its own nuclear weapons research is believed to be \"arguably the key stimulus for the U.S. adoption of serious investigations into nuclear weapons on the eve of the U.S. entry into World War II\". In addition to a letter, with Szil\u00e1rd, to President Roosevelt, recommending the US pay attention and engage in its own nuclear weapons research, [0] used [0]'s connections with the Belgian Royal Family and the Belgian queen mother to get access with a personal envoy to the White House's Oval Office. Some say that as a result of a letter, with Szil\u00e1rd, to President Roosevelt, recommending the US pay attention and engage in its own nuclear weapons research and [0]'s meetings with President Roosevelt, the United States entered the \"race\" to develop the bomb, drawing on the United States's \"immense material, financial, and scientific resources\" to initiate the Manhattan Project.For [0], \"war was a disease\u00a0... [and] [0] called for resistance to war.\" By signing a letter, with Szil\u00e1rd, to President Roosevelt, recommending the US pay attention and engage in its own nuclear weapons research, some argue [0] went against [0]'s pacifist principles. In 1954, a year before [0]'s death, [0] said to [0]'s old friend, Linus Pauling, \"[0] made one great mistake in [0]'s life\u2014when [0] signed a letter, with Szil\u00e1rd, to President Roosevelt, recommending the US pay attention and engage in its own nuclear weapons research; but there was some justification\u2014the danger that the Germans would make atom bombs\u00a0...\" In 1955, [0] and ten other intellectuals and scientists, including British philosopher Bertrand Russell, signed a manifesto highlighting the danger of nuclear weapons. In 1960 [0] was included posthumously as a charter member of the World Academy of Art and Science (WAAS), an organization founded by distinguished scientists and intellectuals who committed themselves to the responsible and ethical advances of science, particularly in light of the development of nuclear weapons.[0] became an American citizen in 1940. Not long after settling into [0]'s career at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, US, [0] expressed [0]'s appreciation of the meritocracy in American culture compared to Europe. [0] recognized the \"right of individuals to say and think what individuals pleased\" without social barriers. As a result, individuals were encouraged, [0] said, to be more creative, a trait [0] valued from [0]'s early education.[0] joined the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in Princeton, New Jersey, US. [0] considered racism the United States's \"worst disease\", seeing racism as \"handed down from one generation to the next\". As part of [0]'s involvement, [0] corresponded with civil rights activist W. E. B. Du Bois and was prepared to testify on civil rights activist W. E. B. Du Bois's behalf during civil rights activist W. E. B. Du Bois's trial in 1951. When [0] offered to be a character witness for civil rights activist W. E. B. Du Bois, the judge decided to drop the case.In 1946, [0] visited Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, a historically black college, where he was awarded an honorary degree. Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, a historically black college, where he was awarded an honorary degree was the first university in the United States to grant college degrees to African Americans; alumni include Langston Hughes and Thurgood Marshall. [0] gave a speech about racism in America, adding, \"[0] do not intend to be quiet about racism in America.\" A resident of Princeton, New Jersey, US recalls that [0] had once paid the college tuition for a black student. [0] has said, \"Being a Jew [0], perhaps [0] can understand and empathize with how black people feel as victims of discrimination\".", "Personal views": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 1918, [0] was one of the founding members of the German Democratic Party, a liberal party. Later in his life, [0]'s political view was in favor of socialism and critical of capitalism, which [0] detailed in [0]'s essays such as \"Why Socialism?\". [0]'s opinions on the Bolsheviks also changed with time. In 1925, [0] criticized the Bolsheviks for not having a \"well-regulated system of government\" and called the Bolsheviks's rule a \"regime of terror and a tragedy in human history\". [0] later adopted a more moderated view, criticizing their methods but praising the Bolsheviks, which is shown by [0]'s 1929 remark on Vladimir Lenin:In Vladimir Lenin [0] honor Vladimir LeninVladimir Lenin's Vladimir Lenin's . [0] do not find their methods advisable. One thing is certain, however: men like Vladimir Lenin are the guardians and renewers of mankind's conscience. [0] offered and was called on to give judgments and opinions on matters often unrelated to theoretical physics or mathematics. [0] strongly advocated the idea of a democratic global government that would check the power of nation-states in the framework of a world federation. [0] wrote \"[0] advocate world government because [0] am convinced that there is no other possible way of eliminating the most terrible danger in which man has ever found man.\" The FBI created a secret dossier on Einstein in 1932; by the time of [0]'s death, a secret dossier on Einstein was 1,427 pages long.[0] was deeply impressed by Mahatma Gandhi, with whom he corresponded. [0] described Mahatma Gandhi, with whom he corresponded as \"a role model for the generations to come\". The initial connection was established on 27 September 1931, when Wilfrid Israel took his Indian guest V. A. Sundaram to meet Wilfrid Israel's at [0]'s summer home in the town of Caputh. his Indian guest V. A. Sundaram was Mahatma Gandhi, with whom he corresponded's disciple and special envoy, whom Wilfrid Israel met while visiting India and visiting Mahatma Gandhi, with whom he corresponded's home in 1925. During meet, [0] wrote a short letter to Mahatma Gandhi, with whom he corresponded that was delivered to Mahatma Gandhi, with whom he corresponded through his Indian guest V. A. Sundaram, and Mahatma Gandhi, with whom he corresponded responded quickly with Mahatma Gandhi, with whom he corresponded's own letter. Although in the end Einstein and Gandhi Mahatma Gandhi, with whom he corresponded were unable to meet as Einstein and Gandhi had hoped, the direct connection between Einstein and Gandhi was established through Wilfrid Israel.[0] was a figurehead leader in the establishment of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which opened in 1925. Earlier, in 1921, [0] was asked by the biochemist and president of the World Zionist Organization, Chaim Weizmann, to help raise funds for the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which opened in 1925. [0] made suggestions for the creation of an Institute of Agriculture, a Chemical Institute and an Institute of Microbiology in order to fight the various ongoing epidemics such as malaria, which [0] called an \"evil\" that was undermining a third of the country's development. [0] also promoted the establishment of an Oriental Studies Institute, to include language courses given in both Hebrew and Arabic.[0] was not a nationalist and opposed the creation of an independent Jewish state. [0] felt that the waves of arriving Jews of the Aliyah could live alongside existing Arabs in Palestine. The state of Israel was established without [0]'s help in 1948; [0] was limited to a marginal role in the Zionist movement. Upon the death of the biochemist and president of the World Zionist Organization, Chaim Weizmann, in November 1952, Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion offered [0] the largely ceremonial position of President of The state of Israel at the urging of Ezriel Carlebach. offered was presented by The state of Israel's ambassador in Washington, Abba Eban, who explained that offered \"embodies the deepest respect which the Jewish people can repose in any of the Jewish people's sons\". [0] wrote that [0] was \"deeply moved\", but \"at once saddened and ashamed\" that [0] could not accept offered.[0] expounded [0]'s spiritual outlook in a wide array of writings and interviews. [0] said [0] had sympathy for the impersonal pantheistic God of Baruch Spinoza's philosophy. [0] did not believe in a personal god who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beingsa personal god who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings , a view which [0] described as na\u00efve. [0] clarified, however, that \"[0] am not an atheist\", preferring to call [0] an agnostic, or a \"deeply religious nonbeliever\". When asked if [0] believed in an afterlife, [0] replied, \"No. And one life is enough for [0].[0] was primarily affiliated with non-religious humanist and Ethical Culture groups in both India and US. [0] served on the advisory board of the First Humanist Society of New York, and was an honorary associate of the Rationalist Association, which publishes New Humanist in Britain. For the 75th anniversary of the New York Society for Ethical Culture, [0] stated that the idea of Ethical Culture embodied [0]'s personal conception of what is most valuable and enduring in religious idealism. [0] observed, \"Without 'ethical culture' there is no salvation for humanity.\"In a German-language letter to philosopher Eric Gutkind, dated 3 January 1954, [0] wrote: The word God is for [0] nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses, the Bible a collection of honorable, but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty childish. No interpretation no matter how subtle can (for [0]) change this. ... For [0] the Jewish religion like all other religions is an incarnation of the most childish superstitions. And the Jewish people to whom I gladly belong and with whose mentality I have a deep affinity have no different quality for [0] than all other people. ... [0] cannot see anything 'chosen' about the Jewish people to whom I gladly belong and with whose mentality I have a deep affinity. [0] had been sympathetic toward vegetarianism for a long time. In a letter in 1930 to Hermann Huth, vice-president of the German Vegetarian Federation (Deutsche Vegetarier-Bund), [0] wrote: Although [0] have been prevented by outward circumstances from observing a strictly vegetarian diet, [0] have long been an adherent to vegetarianism in principle. Besides agreeing with the aims of vegetarianism for aesthetic and moral reasons, it is [0]'s view that a vegetarian manner of living by a vegetarian manner of living's purely physical effect on the human temperament would most beneficially influence the lot of mankind. [0] became a vegetarian [0] only during the last part of his life. In March 1954 [0] wrote in a letter: \"So [0] am living without fats, without meat, without fish, but am feeling quite well this way. It almost seems to [0] that man was not born to be a carnivore.[0] developed an appreciation for music at an early age. In [0]'s late journals [0] wrote:If [0] were not a physicist, [0] would probably be a musician. [0] often think in music. [0] live [0]'s daydreams in music. [0] see [0]'s life in terms of music\u00a0... [0] get most joy in life out of music. His mother played the piano reasonably well and wanted His mother's to learn the violin, not only to instill in [0] a love of music but also to help [0] assimilate into German culture. According to conductor Leon Botstein, [0] began playing when [0] was 5. However, [0] did not enjoy playing at that age.When [0] turned 13, [0] discovered the violin sonatas of Mozart, whereupon [0] became enamored of Mozart's compositions and studied music more willingly. [0] taught [0] to play without \"ever practicing systematically\". [0] said that \"love is a better teacher than a sense of duty\". At the age of 17, [0] was heard by a school examiner in Aarau while playing Beethoven's's violin sonatas. a school examiner stated afterward that [0]'s playing was \"remarkable and revealing of 'great insight'\". What struck a school examiner, writes conductor Leon Botstein, was that [0] \"displayed a deep love of the music, a quality that was and remains in short supply. Music possessed an unusual meaning for [0].\"Music took on a pivotal and permanent role in [0]'s life from that period on. Although the idea of becoming a professional musician [0] was not on [0]'s mind at any time, among those with whom [0] played chamber music were a few professionals, including Kurt Appelbaum, and [0] performed for private audiences and friends. Chamber music had also become a regular part of [0]'s social life while living in Bern, Z\u00fcrich, and Berlin, where [0] played with Max Planck and Max Planck's son, among others. [0] is sometimes erroneously credited as the editor of the 1937 edition of the K\u00f6chel catalog of Mozart's work; the 1937 edition of the K\u00f6chel catalog of Mozart's work was prepared by Alfred Einstein, who may have been a distant relation.In 1931, while engaged in research at the California Institute of Technology, [0] visited the Zoellner family conservatory in Los Angeles, where [0] played some of Beethoven's and Mozart's works with members of the Zoellner Quartet. Near the end of his life, when the young Juilliard Quartet visited [0] in Princeton, [0] played [0]'s violin with the young Juilliard Quartet, and the young Juilliard Quartet was \"impressed by [0]'s level of coordination and intonation\".", "Death": "[0] is our person to focus on. On 17 April 1955, [0] experienced internal bleeding caused by the rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm, which had previously been reinforced surgically by Rudolph Nissen in 1948.

It is tasteless to prolong life artificially. [0] have done [0]'s share; it is time to go. [0] will do it elegantly.\" [0] died in the University Medical Center of Princeton at Plainsboro early the next morning at the age of 76, having continued to work until near the end.During the autopsy, the pathologist Thomas Stoltz Harvey removed [0]'s brain for preservation without the permission of [0]'s family, in the hope that the neuroscience of the future would be able to discover what made [0] so intelligent. Einstein's remains were cremated in Trenton, New Jersey, and Einstein's remains were scattered at an undisclosed location.In a memorial lecture delivered on 13 December 1965 at UNESCO headquarters, nuclear physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer summarized nuclear physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer's impression of [0] as a person: \"[0] was almost wholly without sophistication and wholly without worldliness\u00a0...

In addition to the work [0] did by [0] [0] also collaborated with other scientists on additional projects including the Bose\u2013Einstein statistics, the Einstein refrigerator and others.There is some evidence from [0]'s writings that [0] collaborated with [0]'s first wife, Mileva Mari\u0107.

The Annus Mirabilis papers contributed substantially to the foundation of modern physics and changed views on space, time, and matter. The Annus Mirabilis papers are:", "Statistical mechanics": "[0] is our person to focus on. Einstein's first paper submitted in 1900 to Annalen der Physik was on capillary attraction. Einstein's first paper submitted in 1900 to Annalen der Physik was published in 1901 with the title \"Folgerungen aus den Capillarit\u00e4tserscheinungen\", which translates as \"Conclusions from the capillarity phenomena\". Two papers he published in 1902\u20131903 (thermodynamics) attempted to interpret atomic phenomena from a statistical point of view. Two papers he published in 1902\u20131903 (thermodynamics) were the foundation for the 1905 paper on Brownian motion, which showed that Brownian movement can be construed as firm evidence that molecules exist. [0]'s research in 1903 and 1904 was mainly concerned with the effect of finite atomic size on diffusion phenomena.[0] returned to the problem of thermodynamic fluctuations, giving a treatment of the density variations in a fluid at its critical point. Ordinarily the density variations in a fluid at its critical point are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density. At its critical point, the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density is zero, leading to large fluctuations. The effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered, making the fluid look milky white. [0] relates The effect of density fluctuations to Rayleigh scattering, which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength, and which explains why the sky is blue. [0] quantitatively derived critical opalescence from a treatment of density fluctuations, and demonstrated how both critical opalescence and Rayleigh scattering, which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength, and which explains why the sky is blue originate from the atomistic constitution of matter.", "Special relativity": "[0] is our person to focus on. Einstein's \"Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter K\u00f6rper\" (\"On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies\") was received on 30 June 1905 and published 26 September of 1905. Einstein's \"Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter K\u00f6rper\" (\"On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies\") reconciled conflicts between Maxwell's equations (the laws of electricity and magnetism) and the laws of Newtonian mechanics by introducing changes to the laws of mechanics. Observationally, the effects of changes to the laws of mechanics are most apparent at high speeds (where objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light). The theory developed in Einstein's \"Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter K\u00f6rper\" (\"On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies\") later became known as [0]'s special theory of relativity.Einstein's \"Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter K\u00f6rper\" (\"On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies\") predicted that, when measured in the frame of a relatively moving observer, a clock carried by a moving body would appear to slow down, and a moving body would contract in a moving body's direction of motion. Einstein's \"Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter K\u00f6rper\" (\"On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies\") also argued that the idea of a luminiferous aether\u2014one of the leading theoretical entities in physics at the time\u2014was superfluous.[note 4]In his paper on mass\u2013energy equivalence, [0] produced E\u00a0=\u00a0mc2 as a consequence of [0]'s special relativity equations. his paper on mass\u2013energy equivalence remained controversial for many years, but was accepted by leading physicists, starting with Max Planck.[note [0] originally framed relativity in terms of kinematics (the study of moving bodies). In 1908, Hermann Minkowski reinterpreted relativity in geometric terms as a theory of spacetime. [0] adopted Hermann Minkowski's formalism in [0]'s 1915 general theory of relativity.", "General relativity": "[0] is our person to focus on. General relativity (GR) is a theory of gravitation that was developed by [0] between 1907 and 1915. According to General relativity (GR), the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of spacetime by masses. General relativity (GR) has developed into an essential tool in modern astrophysics; General relativity (GR) provides the foundation for the current understanding of black holes, regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape.As [0] later said, the reason for the development of General relativity (GR) was that the preference of inertial motions within special relativity was unsatisfactory, while a theory which from the outset prefers no state of motion (even accelerated ones) should appear more satisfactory. Consequently, in 1907 [0] published an article on acceleration under special relativity. In an article on acceleration under special relativity, [0] argued that free fall is really inertial motion, and that for a free-falling observer the rules of special relativity must apply. This argument is called the equivalence principle. In an article on acceleration under special relativity, [0] also predicted the phenomena of gravitational time dilation, gravitational redshift and gravitational lensing.In 1911, [0] published another article \"On the Influence of Gravitation on the Propagation of Light\" expanding on an article on acceleration under special relativity, in which [0] estimated the amount of deflection of light by massive bodies. Thus, the theoretical prediction of General relativity (GR) could for the first time be tested experimentally.In 1916, [0] predicted gravitational waves, ripples in the curvature of spacetime which propagate as waves, traveling outward from the source, transporting energy as gravitational radiation. The existence of gravitational waves is possible under special relativity due to special relativity's Lorentz invariance which brings the concept of a finite speed of propagation of the physical interactions of gravity with gravity. By contrast, gravitational waves cannot exist in the Newtonian theory of gravitation, which postulates that the physical interactions of gravity propagate at infinite speed.The first, indirect, detection of gravitational waves came in the 1970s through observation of a pair of closely orbiting neutron stars, PSR B1913+16. The explanation for the decay in a pair of closely orbiting neutron stars, PSR B1913+16's orbital period was that a pair of closely orbiting neutron stars, PSR B1913+16 were emitting gravitational waves. [0]'s was confirmed on 11 February 2016, when researchers at LIGO published the first observation of gravitational waves, detected on Earth on 14 September 2015, nearly one hundred years after predicted.While developing special relativity, [0] became confused about the gauge invariance in special relativity. [0] formulated an argument that led him to conclude that a general relativistic field theory is impossible. [0] gave up looking for fully generally covariant tensor equations and searched for equations that would be invariant under general linear transformations only.In June 1913, the Entwurf ('draft') theory was the result of searched. As the Entwurf ('draft') theory's name suggests, the Entwurf ('draft') theory was a sketch of a theory, less elegant and more difficult than special relativity, with the equations of motion supplemented by additional gauge fixing conditions. After more than two years of intensive work, [0] realized that an argument that led him to conclude that a general relativistic field theory is impossible was mistaken and abandoned the Entwurf ('draft') theory in November 1915.In 1917, [0] applied special relativity to the structure of the universe as a whole. [0] discovered that the general field equations predicted a universe that was dynamic, either contracting or expanding. As observational evidence for a dynamic universe was lacking at the time, [0] introduced a new term, the cosmological constant, into the general field equations, in order to allow special relativity to predict a static universe. the general field equations predicted a static universe of closed curvature, in accordance with [0]'s understanding of Mach's principle in these years. a static universe of closed curvature became known as the Einstein World or [0]'s static universe.Following the discovery of the recession of the galaxies by Edwin Hubble in 1929, [0] abandoned a static universe of closed curvature, and proposed two dynamic models of the cosmos, the Friedmann\u2013Einstein universe of 1931 and the Einstein\u2013de Sitter universe of 1932. In each of two dynamic models of the cosmos, the Friedmann\u2013Einstein universe of 1931 and the Einstein\u2013de Sitter universe of 1932, [0] discarded a new term, the cosmological constant,, claiming that a new term, the cosmological constant, was \"in any case theoretically unsatisfactory\".In many [0] biographies, it is claimed that [0] referred to a new term, the cosmological constant, in later years as [0]'s \"biggest blunder\", based on a letter George Gamow claimed to have received from [0]. The astrophysicist Mario Livio has recently cast doubt on claimed.In late 2013, a team led by the Irish physicist Cormac O'Raifeartaigh discovered evidence that, shortly after learning of Edwin Hubble's observations of the recession of the galaxies, [0] considered a steady-state model of the universe. In a hitherto overlooked manuscript, apparently written in early 1931, [0] explored a model of the universe in which the density of matter remains constant due to a continuous creation of matter, a process that [0] associated with the cosmological constant. As [0] stated in a hitherto overlooked manuscript, apparently written in early 1931, \"In what follows, [0] would like to draw attention to a solution to equation (1) that can account for Hubbel's [sic] facts, and in which the density is constant over time\" ... \"If one considers a physically bounded volume, particles of matter will be continually leaving a physically bounded volume. For the density to remain constant, new particles of matter must be continually formed in a physically bounded volume.\"It thus appears that [0] considered a steady-state model of the universe many years before Hoyle, Bondi and Gold. However, [0]'s steady-state model contained a fundamental flaw and [0] quickly abandoned the idea.special relativity includes a dynamical spacetime, so it is difficult to see how to identify the conserved energy and momentum. Noether's's theorem allows the conserved energy and momentum to be determined from a Lagrangian with translation invariance, but general covariance makes translation invariance into something of a gauge symmetry. The energy and momentum derived within special relativity by Noether's's prescriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason.[0] argued that make is true for a fundamental reason: the gravitational field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates. [0] maintained that the non-covariant energy momentum pseudotensor was, in fact, the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field. While the use of non-covariant objects like pseudotensors was criticized by Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger and others, [0]'s approach has been echoed by physicists including Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz.In 1935, [0] collaborated with Nathan Rosen to produce a model of a wormhole, often called Einstein\u2013Rosen bridges. [0]'s motivation was to model elementary particles with charge as a solution of gravitational field equations, in line with the program outlined in the paper \"Do Gravitational Fields play an Important Role in the Constitution of the Elementary Particles?\". These solutions cut and pasted Schwarzschild black holes to make a bridge between two patches. Because These solutions included spacetime curvature without the presence of a physical body, Einstein and Rosen suggested that Einstein and Rosen could provide the beginnings of a theory that avoided the notion of point particles. However, it was later found that Einstein\u2013Rosen bridges are not stable.In order to incorporate spinning point particles into special relativity, the affine connection needed to be generalized to include an antisymmetric part, called the torsion. generalized was made by [0] and Cartan in the 1920s.In special relativity, gravitational force is reimagined as curvature of spacetime. A curved path like an orbit is not the result of a force deflecting a body from an ideal straight-line path, but rather a body's attempt to fall freely through a background that is itself curved by the presence of other massesa background that is itself curved by the presence of other masses . A remark by John Archibald Wheeler that has become proverbial among physicists summarizes special relativity: \"Spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve.\" The Einstein field equations cover the latter aspect of special relativity, relating the curvature of spacetime to the distribution of matter and energy. The geodesic equation covers the former aspect, stating that freely falling bodies follow lines that are as straight as possible in a curved spacetime. [0] regarded this as an \"independent fundamental assumption\" that had to be postulated in addition to The Einstein field equations in order to complete special relativity. Believing this to be a shortcoming in how special relativity was originally presented, [0] wished to derive The geodesic equation from The Einstein field equations. Since The Einstein field equations are non-linear, a lump of energy made out of pure gravitational fields, like a black hole, would move on a trajectory which is determined by The Einstein field equations, not by a new law. Accordingly, [0] proposed that The Einstein field equations would determine the path of a singular solution, like a black hole, to be a geodesic. Both physicists and philosophers have often repeated the assertion that the geodesic equation can be obtained from applying the field equations to the motion of a gravitational singularity, but the assertion that the geodesic equation can be obtained from applying the field equations to the motion of a gravitational singularity remains disputed.", "Old quantum theory": "[0] is our person to focus on. In a 1905 paper, [0] postulated that light itself light itself consists of localized particles (quanta). localized particles (quanta) were nearly universally rejected by all physicists, including Max Planck and Niels Bohr. consists only became universally accepted in 1919, with Robert Millikan's detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect, and with the measurement of Compton scattering.[0] concluded that each wave of frequency f is associated with a collection of photons with energy hf each, where h is Planck's constant. [0] did not say much more, because [0] was not sure how the particles were related to each wave of frequency f. But [0] did suggest that consists would explain certain experimental results, notably the photoelectric effect.In 1907, [0] proposed a model of matter where each atom in a lattice structure is an independent harmonic oscillator. In a model of matter where each atom in a lattice structure is an independent harmonic oscillator, each atom oscillates independently\u2014a series of equally spaced quantized states for each oscillator. [0] was aware that getting the frequency of the actual oscillations would be difficult, but [0] nevertheless proposed a model of matter where each atom in a lattice structure is an independent harmonic oscillator because a model of matter where each atom in a lattice structure is an independent harmonic oscillator was a particularly clear demonstration that quantum mechanics could solve the specific heat problem in classical mechanics. Peter Debye refined a model of matter where each atom in a lattice structure is an independent harmonic oscillator.In 1924, [0] received a description of a statistical model from Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose, based on a counting method that assumed that light could be understood as a gas of indistinguishable particles. [0] noted that Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose's statistics applied to some atoms as well as to the proposed light particles, and submitted [0]'s translation of Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose's paper to the Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik. [0] also published [0]'s own articles describing a model of matter where each atom in a lattice structure is an independent harmonic oscillator and a model of matter where each atom in a lattice structure is an independent harmonic oscillator's implications, among them the Bose\u2013[0] condensate phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low temperatures. It was not until 1995 that the first such condensate was produced experimentally by Eric Allin Cornell and Carl Wieman using ultra-cooling equipment built at the NIST\u2013JILA laboratory at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Bose\u2013Einstein statistics are now used to describe the behaviors of any assembly of bosons. [0]'s sketches for this project may be seen in the [0] Archive in the library of the Leiden University.Although the patent office promoted [0] to Technical Examiner Second Class in 1906, [0] had not given up on academia. In 1908, [0] became a Privatdozent at the University of Bern. In \"\u00dcber die Entwicklung unserer Anschauungen \u00fcber das Wesen und die Konstitution der Strahlung\" (\"The Development of our Views on the Composition and Essence of Radiation\"), on the quantization of light, and in an earlier 1909 paper, [0] showed that Max Planck's energy quanta must have well-defined momenta and act in some respects as independent, point-like particles. This paper introduced the photon concept (although the name photon was introduced later by Gilbert N. Lewis in 1926) and inspired the notion of wave\u2013particle duality in quantum mechanics. [0] saw the notion of wave\u2013particle duality in quantum mechanics as concrete evidence for [0]'s conviction that physics needed a new, unified foundation.In a series of works completed from 1911 to 1913, Max Planck reformulated Max Planck's 1900 quantum theory and introduced the idea of zero-point energy in Max Planck's \"second quantum theory\". Soon, the idea of zero-point energy attracted the attention of Einstein and his assistant Otto Stern. Assuming the energy of rotating diatomic molecules contains zero-point energy, Einstein and his assistant Otto Stern then compared the theoretical specific heat of hydrogen gas with the experimental data. The numbers matched nicely. However, after publishing the findings, Einstein and his assistant Otto Stern promptly withdrew Einstein and his assistant Otto Stern's support, because Einstein and his assistant Otto Stern no longer had confidence in the correctness of the idea of zero-point energy.In 1917, at the height of [0]'s work on relativity, [0] published an article in Physikalische Zeitschrift that proposed the possibility of stimulated emission, the physical process that makes possible the maser and the laser.an article in Physikalische Zeitschrift that proposed the possibility of stimulated emission, the physical process that makes possible the maser and the laser showed that the statistics of absorption and emission of light would only be consistent with Max Planck's distribution law if the emission of light into a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode. an article in Physikalische Zeitschrift that proposed the possibility of stimulated emission, the physical process that makes possible the maser and the laser was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics, because an article in Physikalische Zeitschrift that proposed the possibility of stimulated emission, the physical process that makes possible the maser and the laser was the first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws.[0] discovered Louis de Broglie's's work and supported Louis de Broglie's's ideas, which were received skeptically at first. In another major paper from this era, [0] observed that de Broglie waves could explain the quantization rules of Bohr and Sommerfeld. another major paper from this era would inspire Schr\u00f6dinger's work of 1926.", "Quantum mechanics": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] played a major role in developing quantum theory, beginning with [0]'s 1905 paper on the photoelectric effect. However, [0] became displeased with modern quantum mechanics as it had evolved after 1925modern quantum mechanics as it had evolved after 1925 , despite modern quantum mechanics as it had evolved after 1925's acceptance by other physicists. [0] was skeptical that the randomness of quantum mechanics was fundamental rather than the result of determinism, stating that God \"is not playing at dice\". Until the end of [0]'s life, [0] continued to maintain that quantum mechanics was incomplete. The Bohr\u2013Einstein debates were a series of public disputes about quantum mechanics between Einstein and Niels Bohr, who were two of its founders. Einstein and Niels Bohr, who were two of its founders's are remembered because of The Bohr\u2013Einstein debates's importance to the philosophy of science. Einstein and Niels Bohr, who were two of its founders's would influence later interpretations of quantum mechanics.[0] never fully accepted quantum mechanics. While [0] recognized that quantum mechanics made correct predictions, [0] believed a more fundamental description of nature must be possible. Over the years [0] presented multiple arguments to this effect, but the one [0] preferred most dated to a debate with Niels Bohr in 1930. [0] suggested a thought experiment in which two objects are allowed to interact and then moved apart a great distance from each other. The quantum-mechanical description of two objects is a mathematical entity known as a wavefunction. If the wavefunction that describes two objects before their interaction is given, then the Schr\u00f6dinger equation provides the wavefunction that describes two objects after their interaction. But because of what would later be called quantum entanglement, measuring one object would lead to an instantaneous change of the wavefunction describing the other object, no matter how far away the other object is. Moreover, the choice of which measurement to perform upon the first object would affect what wavefunction could result for the other object. [0] reasoned that no influence could propagate from the first object to the other object instantaneously fast. Indeed, [0] argued, physics depends on being able to tell one thing apart from another, and such instantaneous influences would call tell into question. Because the true \"physical condition\" of the second object could not be immediately altered by an action done to the first object, [0] concluded, the wavefunction describing the other object could not be the true \"physical condition\" of the second object, only an incomplete description of the true \"physical condition\" of the second object.A more famous version of this argument came in 1935, when [0] published a paper with Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen that laid out what would become known as the EPR paradox. In a thought experiment in which two objects are allowed to interact and then moved apart a great distance from each other, two particles interact in such a way that the wavefunction describing two particles is entangled. Then, no matter how far two particles were separated, a precise position measurement on the first object would imply the ability to predict, perfectly, the result of measuring the position of the other object. Likewise, a precise momentum measurement of the first object would result in an equally precise prediction for of the momentum of the other object, without needing to disturb the other object in any way. They argued that no action taken on the first object could instantaneously affect the other object, since affect would involve information being transmitted faster than light, which is forbidden by the theory of relativity. They invoked a principle, later known as the \"EPR criterion of reality\", positing that: \"If, without in any way disturbing a system, we can predict with certainty (i.e., with probability equal to unity) the value of a physical quantity, then there exists an element of reality corresponding to a physical quantity.\" From a principle, later known as the \"EPR criterion of reality\", They inferred that the other object must have a definite value of both position and of momentum prior to either quantity being measured. But quantum mechanics considers both position and of momentum incompatible and thus does not associate simultaneous values for both position and of momentum to any system. [0]Boris PodolskyNathan Rosen therefore concluded that quantum theory does not provide a complete description of reality.In 1964, John Stewart Bell carried the analysis of quantum entanglement much further. John Stewart Bell deduced that if measurements are performed independently on the two separated particles of an entangled pair, then the assumption that the outcomes depend upon hidden variables within each half implies a mathematical constraint on how the outcomes on the two measurements are correlated. a mathematical constraint on how the outcomes on the two measurements are correlated would later be called a Bell inequality. John Stewart Bell then showed that quantum physics predicts correlations that violate a mathematical constraint on how the outcomes on the two measurements are correlated. Consequently, the only way that hidden variables could explain the predictions of quantum physics is if hidden variables are \"nonlocal\", which is to say that somehow two particles are able to interact instantaneously no matter how widely two particles ever become separated. John Stewart Bell argued that because an explanation of quantum phenomena in terms of hidden variables would require nonlocality, the EPR paradox \"is resolved in the way which [0] would have liked least\".Despite resolved, and although [0] found the argument in a paper with Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen that laid out what would become known as the EPR paradox overly complicated, a paper with Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen that laid out what would become known as the EPR paradox became among the most influential papers published in Physical Review. a paper with Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen that laid out what would become known as the EPR paradox is considered a centerpiece of the development of quantum information theory.", "Unified field theory": "[0] is our person to focus on. Encouraged by [0]'s success with general relativity, [0] sought an even more ambitious geometrical theory that would treat gravitation and electromagnetism as aspects of a single entity. In 1950, [0] described an even more ambitious geometrical theory that would treat gravitation and electromagnetism as aspects of a single entity in a Scientific American article titled \"On the Generalized Theory of Gravitation\". [0]'s attempt to find the most fundamental laws of nature won [0] praise but not success: a particularly conspicuous blemish of an even more ambitious geometrical theory that would treat gravitation and electromagnetism as aspects of a single entity was that an even more ambitious geometrical theory that would treat gravitation and electromagnetism as aspects of a single entity did not accommodate the strong and weak nuclear forces, neither of which was well understood until many years after [0]'s death. Although most researchers now believe that [0]'s approach to unifying physics was mistaken, [0]'s goal of a theory of everything is one to which [0]'s successors still aspire.", "Other investigations": "[0] is our person to focus on.

In addition to longtime collaborators Leopold Infeld, Nathan Rosen, Peter Bergmann and others, [0] also had some one-shot collaborations with various scientists.In 1908, Owen Willans Richardson predicted that a change in the magnetic moment of a free body will cause a free body to rotate. rotate is a consequence of the conservation of angular momentum and is strong enough to be observable in ferromagnetic materials. [0] and Wander Johannes de Haas published two papers in 1915 claiming the first experimental observation of rotate. Measurements of this kind demonstrate that the phenomenon of magnetization is caused by the alignment (polarization) of the angular momenta of the electrons in the material along the axis of magnetization. Measurements of this kind also allow the separation of the two contributions to the magnetization: that which is associated with the spin and with the orbital motion of the electrons.In 1926, Einstein and his former student Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd co-invented (and in 1930, patented) the Einstein refrigerator. the Einstein refrigerator was then revolutionary for having no moving parts and using only heat as an input. On 11 November 1930, U.S. Patent 1,781,541 was awarded to Einstein and his former student Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd for the Einstein refrigerator. Einstein and his former student Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd's invention was not immediately put into commercial production, but the most promising of Einstein and his former student Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd's patents were acquired by the Swedish company Electrolux.[note [0] also invented an electromagnetic pump, sound reproduction device, and several other household devices."}, "Non-scientific legacy": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on.
