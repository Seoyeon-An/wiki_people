[0]'s managed Joseph Ratzinger Sr., a police officer,'s household until His sister, Maria, who never married, died in 1991.At the age of five, [0] was in a group of children who welcomed the visiting Cardinal Archbishop of Munich, Michael von Faulhaber, with flowers. Struck by the visiting Cardinal Archbishop of Munich, Michael von Faulhaber's distinctive garb, [0] announced later that day that [0] wanted to be a cardinal. [0] attended the elementary school in Aschau am Inn, which was renamed in [0]'s honour in 2009. In 1939, aged 12, [0] enrolled in a minor seminary in Traunstein. This period lasted until a minor seminary in Traunstein was closed for military use in 1942, and the students were all sent home. [0] returned to Traunstein.", "Wartime and ordination": "Pope Benedict XVI is our person to focus on. Ratzinger's family, especially his father, bitterly resented the Nazis, and his father's opposition to Nazism resulted in demotions and harassment of Ratzinger's family. Following [0]'s 14th birthday in 1941, [0] was conscripted into the Hitler Youth\u00a0\u2013 as membership was required by law for all 14-year-old German boys after March 1939\u00a0\u2013 but was an unenthusiastic member who refused to attend meetings, according to his brother. In 1941, one of [0]'s cousins, a 14-year-old boy with Down syndrome, was taken away by the Nazis and murdered during the Aktion T4 campaign of Nazi eugenics. In 1943, while still in seminary, [0] was drafted into the German anti-aircraft corps as Luftwaffenhelfer. [0] then trained in the German infantry. As the Allied front drew closer to [0]'s post in 1945, [0] deserted back to Ratzinger's family's home in Traunstein after [0]'s unit had ceased to exist, just as American troops established a headquarters in the [0] household.

In [0]'s early twenties, [0] was deeply influenced by the thought of Italian German Romano Guardini, who taught in Munich from 1946 to 1951 when Ratzinger was studying in Freising and later at the University of Munich. The intellectual affinity between these two thinkers, who would later become decisive figures for the twentieth-century Catholic Church, was preoccupied with rediscovering the essentials of Christianity: Italian German Romano Guardini, who taught in Munich from 1946 to 1951 when Ratzinger was studying in Freising and later at the University of Munich wrote Italian German Romano Guardini, who taught in Munich from 1946 to 1951 when Ratzinger was studying in Freising and later at the University of Munich's 1938 The Essence of Christianity, while [0] penned Introduction to Christianity, three decades later in 1968. Italian German Romano Guardini, who taught in Munich from 1946 to 1951 when Ratzinger was studying in Freising and later at the University of Munich inspired many in the Catholic social-democratic tradition, particularly the Communion and Liberation movement in the New Evangelization encouraged under the papacy of the Polish Pope John Paul\u00a0II.

During this period, [0] participated in the Second Vatican Council (1962\u20131965) and served as a peritus (theological consultant) to Cardinal Frings of Cologne. [0] was viewed during the time of the Second Vatican Council (1962\u20131965) as a reformer, cooperating with theologians like Hans K\u00fcng and Edward Schillebeeckx. [0] became an admirer of Karl Rahner, a well-known academic theologian of the Nouvelle th\u00e9ologie and a proponent of Church reform.In 1966, [0] was appointed to a chair in dogmatic theology at the University of T\u00fcbingen, where he was a colleague of Hans K\u00fcng. In [0]'s 1968 book Introduction to Christianity, [0] wrote that the pope has a duty to hear differing voices within the Church before making a decision, and [0] downplayed the centrality of the papacy. During this time, [0] distanced [0] from the atmosphere of the University of T\u00fcbingen, where he was a colleague of Hans K\u00fcng and the Marxist leanings of the student movement of the 1960s that quickly radicalized, in the years 1967 and 1968, culminating in a series of disturbances and riots in April and May 1968. [0] came increasingly to see these and associated developments (such as decreasing respect for authority among [0]'s students) as connected to a departure from traditional Catholic teachings. Despite [0]'s reformist bent, [0]'s views increasingly came to contrast with the liberal ideas gaining currency in theological circles. [0] was invited by Rev. Theodore Hesburgh to join the theology faculty at the University of Notre Dame, but declined on grounds that [0]'s English was not good enough.Some voices, among them Hans K\u00fcng, deemed this time a turn towards conservatism, while [0] said in a 1993 interview, \"[0] see no break in [0]'s views as a theologian [over the years]\". [0] continued to defend the work of the Second Vatican Council (1962\u20131965), including Nostra aetate, the document on respect of other religions, ecumenism, and the declaration of the right to freedom of religion. Later, as the Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, [0] most clearly spelled out the Church's position on other religions in the 2000 document Dominus Iesus which also talks about the Catholic way to engage in \"ecumenical dialogue\". During [0]'s time at the University of T\u00fcbingen, where he was a colleague of Hans K\u00fcng, [0] published articles in the reformist theological journal Concilium, though [0] increasingly chose less reformist themes than other contributors to the reformist theological journal Concilium such as Hans K\u00fcng and Edward Schillebeeckx.In 1969, [0] returned to Bavaria, to the University of Regensburg and co-founded the theological journal Communio, with Hans Urs von Balthasar, Henri de Lubac, Walter Kasper, and others, in 1972. the theological journal Communio has become a prominent journal of contemporary Catholic theological thought. Until [0] was elected pope, [0] remained one of the theological journal Communio's most prolific contributors. In 1976, [0] suggested that the Augsburg Confession might be recognised as a Catholic statement of faith. Several of Benedict's former students became [0]'s confidantes, notably Christoph Sch\u00f6nborn, and a number of [0]'s former students sometimes meet for discussions.

The theologian Leonardo Boff, for example, was suspended, while others such as Matthew Fox were censured. Other issues also prompted condemnations or revocations of rights to teach: for instance, some posthumous writings of Jesuit priest Anthony de Mello were the subject of a notification. [0] and the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, formerly known as the \"Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office\", the historical Roman Inquisition viewed many of some posthumous writings of Jesuit priest Anthony de Mello, particularly the later works, as having an element of religious indifferentism (in other words, that Christ was \"one master alongside others\"). In particular, Dominus Iesus, published by the congregation in the jubilee year 2000, the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, formerly known as the \"Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office\", the historical Roman Inquisition reaffirmed many recently \"unpopular\" ideas, including the Catholic Church's position that \"salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved.\" Dominus Iesus, published by the congregation in the jubilee year 2000, angered many Protestant churches by claiming that many Protestant churches are not churches, but \"ecclesial communities\".Ratzinger's 2001 letter De delictis gravioribus clarified the confidentiality of internal church investigations, as defined in the 1962 document Crimen sollicitationis, into accusations made against priests of certain crimes, including sexual abuse. the confidentiality of internal church investigations, as defined in the 1962 document Crimen sollicitationis, into accusations made against priests of certain crimes, including sexual abuse became a subject of controversy during the sex abuse cases.

Later, as pope, [0] was accused in a lawsuit of conspiring to cover up the molestation of three boys in Texas, but sought and obtained diplomatic immunity from liability.On 12 March 1983, Ratzinger, as prefect, notified the lay faithful and the clergy that Archbishop Pierre Martin Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Th\u1ee5c had incurred excommunication latae sententiae for illicit episcopal consecrations without the apostolic mandate.

Only in this friendship do we experience beauty and liberation. ... When we give we to Jesus Christ, we receive a hundredfold in return. Yes, open, open wide the doors to Jesus Christ\u00a0\u2013 and you will find true life. \"Friendship with Jesus Christ\" was a frequent theme of [0]'s preaching. [0] stressed that on Friendship with Jesus Christ, \"everything depends\". [0] also said: \"We are all called to open We to this friendship ... speaking to God as to a friend, the only One who can make the world both good and happy ... That is all we have to do is put ourselves at God's disposal ... is an extremely important message. an extremely important message is a message that helps to overcome what can be considered the great temptation of our time: the claim, that after the Big Bang, God withdrew from history.\" Thus, in [0]'s book Jesus of Nazareth, [0]'s main purpose was \"to help foster [in the reader] the growth of a living relationship\" with Jesus Christ. [0] took up this theme in his first encyclical Deus caritas est. In [0]'s explanation and summary of his first encyclical Deus caritas est, [0] stated: \"If friendship with God becomes for us something ever more important and decisive, then we will begin to love those whom God loves and who are in need of us. God wants us to be friends of His friends and we can be so, if we are interiorly close to His friends.\" Thus, [0] said that prayer is \"urgently needed ... It is time to reaffirm the importance of prayer in the face of the activism and the growing secularism of many Christians engaged in charitable work.\"Continuing what [0] said in the pre-conclave Mass about what [0] often referred to as the \"central problem of our faith today\", on 6 June 2005, [0] also said:today, a particularly insidious obstacle to the task of education is the massive presence in our society and culture of that relativism which, recognising nothing as definitive, leaves as the ultimate criterion only the self with its desires. And under the semblance of freedom that relativism which, recognising nothing as definitive, leaves as the ultimate criterion only the self with its desires becomes a prison for each one, for that relativism which, recognising nothing as definitive, leaves as the ultimate criterion only the self with its desires separates people from one another, locking each person into each person's or each person's own ego. [0] said that \"a dictatorship of relativism\" was the core challenge facing the Church and humanity. At the root of the core challenge facing the Church and humanity, [0] said, is Immanuel Kant's \"self-limitation of reason\". Immanuel Kant's \"self-limitation of reason\", [0] said, is contradictory to the modern acclamation of science whose excellence is based on the power of reason to know the truth. [0] said that Immanuel Kant's \"self-limitation of reason\" leads to pathologies of religion such as terrorism and pathologies of science such as ecological disasters. [0] traced the failed revolutions and violent ideologies of the 20th century to a conversion of partial points of view into absolute guides. [0] said \"Absolutizing what is not absolute but relative is called totalitarianism.\"In the discussion with secularism and rationalism, one of [0]'s basic ideas can be found in [0]'s address on the \"Crisis of Culture\" in the West, a day before Pope John Paul\u00a0II died, when [0] referred to Christianity as the \"religion of the Logos\" (the Greek for \"word\", \"reason\", \"meaning\", or \"intelligence\"). [0] said:From the beginning, Christianity has understood Christianity as the religion of the Logos\" (the Greek for \"word\", \"reason\", \"meaning\", or \"intelligence\"), as the religion according to reason ... Christianity has always defined men, all men without distinction, as creatures and images of God, proclaiming for men, all men without distinction ... the same dignity. In this connection, his first encyclical Deus caritas est is of Christian origin and it is no accident that his first encyclical Deus caritas est was born precisely and exclusively in the realm of the Catholic faith. ... It was and is the merit of his first encyclical Deus caritas est to have again proposed these original values of Christianity and of having given back to reason reason's own voice ... Today, this should be precisely [Christianity's] philosophical strength, in so far as the problem is whether the world comes from the irrational, and reason is not other than a 'sub-product,' on occasion even harmful of the world's development\u00a0\u2013 or whether the world comes from reason, and is, as a consequence, the world's criterion and goal ... In the so necessary dialogue between secularists and Catholics, we Christians must be very careful to remain faithful to this fundamental line: to live a faith that comes from the Logos, from creative reason, and that, because of this, is also open to all that is truly rational. [0] also emphasised that \"Only creative reason, which in God is manifested as love, can really show us the way.[0] wrote three encyclicals: Deus caritas est (Latin for \"God is Love\"), Spe salvi (\"Saved by Hope\"), and Caritas in veritate (\"Love in Truth\").In his first encyclical Deus caritas est [0] said that a human being, created in the image of God who is love, can practice love: to give a human being, created in the image of God who is love to God and others (agape) by receiving and experiencing God's love in contemplation. This life of love, according to [0], is the life of the saints such as Teresa of Calcutta and the Blessed Virgin Mary, and is the direction Christians take when Christians believe that God loves Christians in Jesus Christ. his first encyclical Deus caritas est contains almost 16,000 words in 42 paragraphs. The first half is said to have been written by [0] in German, [0]'s first language, in the summer of 2005; the second half is derived from uncompleted writings left by [0]'s predecessor, Pope John Paul\u00a0II. his first encyclical Deus caritas est was signed by [0] on Christmas Day, 25 December 2005. his first encyclical Deus caritas est was promulgated a month later in Latin and was translated into English, French, German, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, and Spanish. his first encyclical Deus caritas est is the first encyclical to be published since the Vatican decided to assert copyright in the official writings of [0].[0]'s second encyclical titled Spe Salvi (\"Saved by Hope\"), about the virtue of hope, was released on 30 November 2007.His third encyclical titled Caritas in veritate (\"Love in Truth\" or \"Charity in Truth\"), was signed on 29 June 2009 (the Feast of Sts. Peter and Paul) and released on 7 July 2009. In 2007.His third encyclical titled Caritas in veritate (\"Love in Truth\" or \"Charity in Truth\"), [0] continued the Church's's teachings on social justice. [0] condemned the prevalent economic system \"where the pernicious effects of sin are evident,\" and called on people to rediscover ethics in business and economic relations.At the time of [0]'s , [0] had completed a draft of a fourth encyclical entitled Lumen fidei (\"The Light of Faith\"), intended to accompany [0]'s first two encyclicals to complete a trilogy on the three theological virtues of faith, hope, and love. Benedict's successor, Francis, completed and published a fourth encyclical entitled Lumen fidei (\"The Light of Faith\") in June 2013, four months after [0]'s and Benedict's successor, Francis,'s succession. Although a fourth encyclical entitled Lumen fidei (\"The Light of Faith\") is officially the work of Benedict's successor, Francis,, paragraph 7 of a fourth encyclical entitled Lumen fidei (\"The Light of Faith\") explicitly expresses Benedict's successor, Francis,'s debt to [0]: \"These considerations on faith \u2013 in continuity with all that the Church's's magisterium has pronounced on faith \u2013 are meant to supplement what [0] had written in [0]'s encyclical letters on charity and hope. [0] had almost completed a first draft of an encyclical on faith. For completed Benedict's successor, Francis, am deeply grateful to [0], and as [0]'s brother in Jesus Christ Benedict's successor, Francis, have taken up [0]'s fine work and added a few contributions of Benedict's successor, Francis,'s own.\"Sacramentum caritatis (The Sacrament of Charity), signed 22 February 2007, was released in Latin, Italian, English, French, German, Portuguese, Spanish, and Polish. his first encyclical Deus caritas est was made available in various languages on 13 March 2007 in Rome. The English edition of Libera Editrice Vaticana is 158 pages. his first encyclical Deus caritas est \"seeks to take up the richness and variety of the reflections and proposals which emerged from the Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops\" which was held in 2006.On 7 July 2007, [0] issued his first encyclical Deus caritas est, declaring that upon \"the request of the faithful\", the celebration of Mass according to the Missal of 1962 (of the Tridentine Mass), was to be more easily permitted. Stable groups who previously had to petition their bishop to have a Tridentine Mass Stable groups who previously had to petition their bishop to have a Tridentine Mass's may now merely request permission from Stable groups who previously had to petition their bishop to have a Tridentine Mass's local priest. While his first encyclical Deus caritas est directs that pastors should provide the Tridentine Mass upon the requests of the faithful, his first encyclical Deus caritas est also allows for any qualified priest to offer private celebrations of the Tridentine Mass, to which the faithful may be admitted if the faithful wish. For regularly scheduled public celebrations of the Tridentine Mass, the permission of the priest in charge of the church is required.In an accompanying letter, [0] outlined [0]'s position concerning questions about the new guidelines. As there were fears that issued would entail a reversal of the Second Vatican Council, [0] emphasised that the Tridentine Mass would not detract from the Second Vatican Council and that the Mass of Paul VI would still be the norm and priests were not permitted to refuse to say the Mass of Paul VI in the Mass of Paul VI. [0] pointed out that the use of Tridentine Mass \"was never juridically abrogated and, consequently, in principle, was always permitted.\" an accompanying letter also decried \"deformations of the liturgy ... because in many places celebrations were not faithful to the prescriptions of the Missal of 1962\" as the Second Vatican Council was wrongly seen \"as authorising or even requiring creativity\", mentioning [0]'s own experience.[0] considered that allowing the Tridentine Mass to those who request the Tridentine Mass was a means to prevent or heal schism, stating that, on occasions in history, \"not enough was done by the Church's's leaders to maintain or regain reconciliation and unity\" and that allowing \"imposes an obligation on the Church's today: to make every effort to enable for all those who truly desire unity to remain in unity or to attain unity anew.\" Cardinal Dar\u00edo Castrill\u00f3n Hoyos, the president of the Pontifical Commission established to facilitate full ecclesial communion of those associated with that Society, stated that his first encyclical Deus caritas est \"opened the door for those associated with that Society's return\". Bishop Bernard Fellay, superior general of that Society, expressed \"deep gratitude to [0] for this great spiritual benefit\".In July 2021, Benedict's successor, Francis, issued the apostolic letter titled Traditionis custodes, which substantially reversed the decision of Benedict\u00a0XVI in Summorum Pontificum and imposed new and broad restrictions on the use of the Traditional Latin Mass. the decision of Benedict\u00a0XVI in Summorum Pontificum was controversial and widely criticized by conservative and traditionalist Catholics as lacking in charity and an attack on those attached to the liturgical patrimony of the Church's.Near the end of June 2007, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith issued a document approved by Benedict\u00a0XVI \"because some contemporary theological interpretations of the Vatican's ecumenical intent had been 'erroneous or ambiguous' and had prompted confusion and doubt.\" a document approved by Benedict\u00a0XVI has been seen as restating \"key sections of a 2000 text [0] wrote when [0] was prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Dominus Iesus.[0] condemned excessive consumerism, especially among youth. [0] stated in December 2007 that \"dolescents, youths and even children are easy victims of the corruption of love, deceived by unscrupulous adults who, lying to dolescents, youths and even children and to dolescents, youths and even children, draw dolescents, youths and even children into the dead-end streets of consumerism.\" In June 2009, [0] blamed outsourcing for the greater availability of consumer goods which lead to the downsizing of social security systems.", "Ecumenism": "[0] is our person to focus on. Speaking at [0]'s weekly audience in St. Peter's's Square on 7 June 2006, [0] asserted that Jesus himself had entrusted the leadership of the Church to St. Peter's. \"St. Peter's's responsibility thus consists of guaranteeing the communion with Jesus himself. Let us pray so that the primacy of Peter, entrusted to poor human beings, may always be exercised in this original sense desired by Jesus himself, so that the primacy of Peter, entrusted to poor human beings will be increasingly recognised in the primacy of Peter, entrusted to poor human beings's true meaning by brothers who are still not in communion with us.\"Also in 2006, [0] met the Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams. In their's Common Declaration, their highlighted the previous 40 years of dialogue between Catholics and Anglicans while also acknowledging \"serious obstacles to our ecumenical progress\".On 4 November 2009, in response to a 2007 petition by the Traditional Anglican Church, [0] issued the apostolic constitution Anglicanorum coetibus, which authorized the creation of \"Personal Ordinariates for Anglicans entering into full communion.\" Between 2011 and 2012, three ordinariates were erected, currently totalling 9090 members, 194 priests, and 94 parishes.", "Interfaith dialogue": "[0] is our person to focus on. When [0] ascended to the papacy, [0]'s was welcomed by the Anti-Defamation League who noted \"[0]'s great sensitivity to Jewish history and the Holocaust\". However, [0]'s received a more reserved response from British Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks, who hoped that [0] would \"continue along the path of Pope John\u00a0XXIII and Pope John Paul\u00a0II in working to enhance relations with the Jewish people and the State of Israel.\" Israeli foreign minister Silvan Shalom also offered tentative praise, though Israeli foreign minister Silvan Shalom believed that \"[0], considering [0]'s historical experience, will be especially committed to an uncompromising fight against anti-Semitism.\"Critics have accused [0]'s papacy of insensitivity towards Judaism. The two most prominent instances were the expansion of the use of the Tridentine Mass and the lifting of the excommunication on four bishops from the Society of St. Pius X (SSPX). In the Good Friday service, the Tridentine Mass rubrics include a prayer that asks God to lift the veil so they [Jews] may be delivered from their darkness. This prayer has historically been contentious in Judaic-Catholic relations and several groups saw the restoration of the Tridentine Mass as problematic. Among those whose excommunications were the lifting of the excommunication on four bishops from the Society of St. Pius X (SSPX) was Bishop Richard Williamson, an outspoken historical revisionist sometimes interpreted as a Holocaust denier. the lifting of the excommunication on four bishops from the Society of St. Pius X (SSPX) led critics to charge that [0] was condoning Bishop Richard Williamson, an outspoken historical revisionist sometimes interpreted as a Holocaust denier's historical revisionist views.[0]'s relations with Islam were strained at times. On 12 September 2006, [0] delivered a lecture which touched on Islam at the University of Regensburg in Germany. [0] had served there as a professor of theology before becoming Pope, and a lecture which touched on Islam was entitled \"Faith, Reason and the University\u00a0\u2013 Memories and Reflections\". a lecture which touched on Islam received much attention from political and religious authorities. Many Islamic politicians and religious leaders registered Many Islamic politicians and religious leaders's protest against what Many Islamic politicians and religious leaders labelled an insulting mischaracterization of Islam, although [0]'s focus was aimed towards the rationality of religious violence, and religious violence's effect on the religion. Muslims were particularly offended by a passage that [0] quoted in a lecture which touched on Islam: \"Show [0] just what Muhammad brought that was new and there you will find things only evil and inhuman, such as Muhammad's command to spread by the sword the faith Muhammad preached.\"The passage originally appeared in the Dialogue Held with a Certain Persian, the Worthy Mouterizes, in Anakara of Galatia written in 1391 as an expression of the views of the Byzantine emperor Manuel\u00a0II Paleologus, one of the last Christian rulers before the Fall of Constantinople to the Muslim Ottoman Empire, on such issues as forced conversion, holy war, and the relationship between faith and reason. According to the German text, [0]'s original comment was that the Byzantine emperor Manuel\u00a0II Paleologus, one of the last Christian rulers before the Fall of Constantinople to the Muslim Ottoman Empire \"addresses the Byzantine emperor Manuel\u00a0II Paleologus, one of the last Christian rulers before the Fall of Constantinople to the Muslim Ottoman Empire's interlocutor in an astoundingly harsh\u00a0\u2013 to us surprisingly harsh\u00a0\u2013 way\" (wendet er sich in erstaunlich schroffer, uns \u00fcberraschend schroffer Form). [0] apologized for any offence [0] had caused and made a point of visiting Turkey, a predominantly Muslim country, and praying in Turkey, a predominantly Muslim country's Blue Mosque. [0] planned on 5 March 2008, to meet with Muslim scholars and religious leaders autumn 2008 at a Catholic-Muslim seminar in Rome. a Catholic-Muslim seminar in Rome was held from 4\u20136 November 2008. On 9 May 2009, [0] visited the King Hussein Mosque in Amman, Jordan where [0] was addressed by Prince Ghazi bin Muhammad.The Dalai Lama congratulated Benedict\u00a0XVI upon Benedict\u00a0XVI's , and visited Benedict\u00a0XVI in October 2006 in Vatican City. In 2007, the People's Republic of China was accused of using the People's Republic of China's political influence to stop a meeting between [0] and The Dalai Lama.While visiting Brazil in May 2007, \"[0] sparked controversy by saying that native populations had been 'silently longing' for the Christian faith brought to South America by colonizers.\" [0] continued, stating that \"the proclamation of Jesus and of Jesus's Gospel did not at any point involve an alienation of the pre-Columbus cultures, nor was it the imposition of a foreign culture.\" Venezuelan president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez demanded an apology, and an indigenous organization in Ecuador issued a response which stated that \"representatives of the Catholic Church of those times, with honourable exceptions, were accomplices, deceivers and beneficiaries of one of the most horrific genocides of all humanity.\" Later, [0], speaking Italian, said at a weekly audience that it was \"not possible to forget the suffering and the injustices inflicted by colonizers against the indigenous population, whose fundamental human rights were often trampled\" but made no apology.While visiting the United States on 17 April 2008, [0] met with International Society for Krishna Consciousness representative Radhika Ramana Dasa, a noted Hindu scholar and disciple of Hanumatpreshaka Swami. On behalf of the Hindu American community, International Society for Krishna Consciousness representative Radhika Ramana Dasa, a noted Hindu scholar and disciple of Hanumatpreshaka Swami presented a gift of an Om symbol to [0].", "Apostolic ministry": "[0] is our person to focus on. As pontiff, [0] carried out numerous Apostolic activities including journeys across the world and in the Vatican.[0] travelled extensively during the first three years of [0]'s papacy. In addition to [0]'s travels within Italy, [0] made two visits to [0]'s homeland, Germany, one for World Youth Day and another to visit the towns of [0]'s childhood. [0] also visited Poland and Spain, where [0] was enthusiastically received. His visit to Turkey, an overwhelmingly Muslim nation, was initially overshadowed by the controversy about a lecture [0] had given at Regensburg. His visit to Turkey, an overwhelmingly Muslim nation, was met by nationalist and Islamic protesters and was placed under unprecedented security measures. [0] made a joint declaration with Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew\u00a0I in an attempt to begin to heal the rift between the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches.In 2007, [0] visited Brazil to address the Bishops' Conference there and canonize Friar Ant\u00f4nio Galv\u00e3o, an 18th-century Franciscan. In June 2007, [0] made a personal pilgrimage and pastoral visit to Assisi, the birthplace of St. Francis. In September, [0] undertook a three-day visit to Austria, during which [0] joined Vienna's chief rabbi, Paul Chaim Eisenberg, in a memorial to the 65,000 Viennese Jews who perished in Nazi death camps. During [0]'s stay in Austria, [0] also celebrated Mass at the Marian shrine Mariazell and visited Heiligenkreuz Abbey.In April 2008, [0] made [0]'s first visit to the United States since becoming pope.

Also while in New York City where he addressed the United Nations General Assembly, [0] celebrated Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral, met with disabled children and disabled children's families, and attended an event for Catholic youth, where [0] addressed some 25,000 young people in attendance. On the final day of His visit to Turkey, an overwhelmingly Muslim nation,, [0] visited the World Trade Center site and later celebrated Mass at Yankee Stadium.In July 2008, [0] travelled to Australia to attend World Youth Day 2008 in Sydney. On 19 July, in St. Mary's Cathedral, [0] made an apology for child sex abuse perpetrated by the clergy in Australia. On 13 September 2008, at an outdoor Paris Mass attended by 250,000 people, [0] condemned the modern materialism\u00a0\u2013 the world's love of power, possessions, and money as a modern-day plague, comparing the modern materialism\u00a0\u2013 the world's love of power, possessions, and money as a modern-day plague to paganism. In 2009, [0] visited Africa (Cameroon and Angola) for the first time as pope. During His visit to Turkey, an overwhelmingly Muslim nation,, [0] suggested that altering sexual behaviour was the answer to Africa (Cameroon and Angola)'s AIDS crisis and urged Catholics to reach out and convert believers in sorcery. [0] visited the Middle East (Jordan, Israel, and Palestine) in May [0]'s main arena for pastoral activity was the Vatican, [0]'s Christmas and Easter homilies and Urbi et Orbi were delivered from St. Peter's Basilica. the Vatican is also the only regular place where [0] travelled via motor without the protective bulletproof case common to most popemobiles. Despite the more secure setting, [0] was victim to security risks several times inside the Vatican. On Wednesday, 6 June 2007, during [0]'s General Audience, a man leapt across a barrier, evaded guards, and nearly mounted [0]'s vehicle, although a man was stopped and [0] seemed to be unaware of the event. On Thursday, 24 December 2009, while [0] was proceeding to the altar to celebrate Christmas Eve Mass at St. Peter's Basilica, a woman later identified as 25-year-old Susanna Maiolo, who holds Italian and Swiss citizenship, jumped the barrier and grabbed [0] by [0]'s vestments and pulled [0] to the ground.

Roger Etchegaray, the vice-dean of the College of Cardinals, fell as well and suffered a hip fracture. Italian police reported that 25-year-old Susanna Maiolo, who holds Italian and Swiss citizenship had in a prior action attempted to accost [0] at the previous Christmas Eve Mass, but was prevented from doing so.In [0]'s homily, [0] forgave 25-year-old Susanna Maiolo, who holds Italian and Swiss citizenship and urged the world to \"wake up\" from selfishness and petty affairs, and find time for God and spiritual matters.Between 17 and 18 April 2010, [0] made an Apostolic Journey to the Republic of Malta. Following meetings with various dignitaries on [0]'s first day on the Republic of Malta, 50,000 people gathered in a drizzle for Papal Mass on the granaries in Floriana. [0] also met with the Maltese youth at the Valletta Waterfront, where an estimated 10,000 young people turned up to greet [0].", "Sexual abuse in the Catholic Church": "Pope Benedict XVI is our person to focus on. Prior to [0], the primary responsibility for investigating allegations of sexual abuse and disciplining perpetrators rested with the individual dioceses. In [0], Ratzinger convinced John Paul\u00a0II to put the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in charge of all sexual abuse investigations. According to John L. Allen Jr., Ratzinger in the following years \"acquired a familiarity with the contours of the problem that virtually no other figure in the Catholic Church can claim. Driven by that encounter with what Ratzinger would later refer to as 'filth' in the Catholic Church, Ratzinger seems to have undergone something of a 'conversion experience' throughout 2003\u201304. From that point forward, Ratzinger and Ratzinger's staff seemed driven by a convert's zeal to clean up the mess.\"Cardinal Vincent Nichols wrote that in Ratzinger's role as head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith \"[Ratzinger] led important changes made in church law: the inclusion in canon law of internet offences against children, the extension of child abuse offences to include the sexual abuse of all under 18, the case by case waiving of the statute of limitation and the establishment of a fast-track dismissal from the clerical state for offenders.\" According to Charles J. Scicluna, a former prosecutor handling sexual abuse cases, \"Ratzinger displayed great wisdom and firmness in handling sexual abuse cases, also demonstrating great courage in facing some of the most difficult and thorny cases, sine acceptione personarum [without respect of persons]\". According to Cardinal Christoph Sch\u00f6nborn, Ratzinger \"made entirely clear efforts not to cover things up but to tackle and investigate things. This was not always met with approval in the Vatican\". Ratzinger had pressed John Paul\u00a0II to investigate Hans Hermann Gro\u00ebr, an Austrian cardinal and friend of John Paul accused of sexual abuse, which resulted in Hans Hermann Gro\u00ebr, an Austrian cardinal and friend of John Paul accused of sexual abuse's resignation.In March 2010, Pope Benedict XVI sent a pastoral letter to the Catholic Church in Ireland addressing cases of sexual abuse by priests of minors, expressing sorrow and promising changes in the way in which accusations of abuse were addressed. Victims' groups claimed a pastoral letter failed to clarify if secular law enforcement had priority over canon law confidentiality regarding internal investigation of abuse allegations. the Vatican then promised to introduce measures that would \"safeguard young people in the future\" and \"bring to justice\" priests who were responsible for abuse and the next month the Vatican issued guidelines on how existing church law should be implemented. guidelines on how existing church law should be implemented asserted that \"Civil law concerning reporting of crimes\u00a0... should always be followed.\"Despite being more proactive than Pope Benedict XVI's predecessor in addressing sexual abuse, Pope Benedict XVI was nonetheless cited as failing to do so on more than one occasion. In January 2022, a report written by German law firm Westpfahl Spilker Wastl and commissioned by the Catholic Church concluded that Ratzinger failed to adequately take action against clerics in four cases of alleged abuse while Ratzinger was Archbishop of Munich and Freising from 1977 to 1982. Ratzinger denied the accusations. Pope Benedict XVI corrected his former statement that he had not been at a meeting of the ordinariate of the Archdiocese of Munich and Freising in January 1980, saying Pope Benedict XVI mistakenly told German investigators Pope Benedict XVI was not there. However, corrected was \"not done out of bad faith\", but \"the result of an error in the editorial processing\" of his former statement that he had not been at a meeting of the ordinariate of the Archdiocese of Munich and Freising in January 1980. According to Reuters, lawyer Martin Pusch said that \"in a total of four cases, we have come to the conclusion that Ratzinger can be accused of misconduct in cases of sexual abuse.\"In February 2022, Pope Benedict XVI admitted that errors were made in the treating of sexual abuse cases when Pope Benedict XVI was Archbishop of Munich. According to the letter released by the Vatican, Pope Benedict XVI asked forgiveness for any \"grievous fault\" but denied personal wrongdoing. Pope Benedict XVI stated: \"Pope Benedict XVI have had great responsibilities in the Catholic Church. All the greater is Pope Benedict XVI's pain for the abuses and the errors that occurred in those different places during the time of Pope Benedict XVI's mandate.\" Public prosecutor's office in Munich had begun investigations as a result of the 2022 report against both Pope Benedict XVI and Cardinal Friedrich Wetter. investigations was \"discontinued\" in March 2023 after investigations \"did not reveal sufficient suspicion of criminal activity\". The case of investigations \"was not acts of abuse committed by the Church personnel managers themselvesthe Church personnel managers themselves, but possible acts of aiding and abetting by active action or omission\".One of the cases Ratzinger pursued involved Marcial Maciel, a Mexican priest and founder of the Legionaries of Christ who had been accused repeatedly of sexual abuse. Biographer Andrea Tornielli suggested that Ratzinger had wanted to take action against Marcial Maciel, a Mexican priest and founder of the Legionaries of Christ who had been accused repeatedly of sexual abuse but that John Paul\u00a0II and other high-ranking officials, including several cardinals and the Vatican's influential secretary Stanis\u0142aw Dziwisz, prevented Ratzinger from doing so.According to Jason Berry, Cardinal Angelo Sodano \"pressured\" Ratzinger to halt the proceedings against Marcial Maciel, a Mexican priest and founder of the Legionaries of Christ who had been accused repeatedly of sexual abuse in 1999. When Marcial Maciel, a Mexican priest and founder of the Legionaries of Christ who had been accused repeatedly of sexual abuse was honoured by the Vatican in 2004, new accusers came forward and Ratzinger \"took it on Ratzinger to authorize an investigation of Marcial Maciel, a Mexican priest and founder of the Legionaries of Christ who had been accused repeatedly of sexual abuse\". After Ratzinger became pope, Ratzinger began proceedings against Marcial Maciel, a Mexican priest and founder of the Legionaries of Christ who had been accused repeatedly of sexual abuse and the Legionaries of Christ that forced Marcial Maciel, a Mexican priest and founder of the Legionaries of Christ who had been accused repeatedly of sexual abuse out of active service in the Catholic Church. On 1 May 2010, the Vatican issued a statement denouncing \"the most serious and objectively immoral behavior of Marcial Maciel, a Mexican priest and founder of the Legionaries of Christ who had been accused repeatedly of sexual abuse, confirmed by incontrovertible witnesses, which amount to true crimes and show a life deprived of scruples and authentic religious feeling.\"In November 2020, the Vatican published a report blaming Popes John Paul\u00a0II and Benedict\u00a0XVI for allowing defrocked former cardinal Theodore McCarrick to rise in power despite the fact that Popes John Paul\u00a0II and Benedict\u00a0XVI knew of sex abuse allegations against defrocked former cardinal Theodore McCarrick. Despite the fact that Pope Benedict XVI pressured defrocked former cardinal Theodore McCarrick to resign as Archbishop of Washington D.C. in 2006, defrocked former cardinal Theodore McCarrick remained very active in ministry throughout Pope Benedict XVI's papacy and even made a very public appearance when defrocked former cardinal Theodore McCarrick presided over US senator Ted Kennedy's burial service at Arlington National Cemetery in 2009.In 2019, Pope Benedict XVI released a 6,000-word letter that attributed the Church's sexual abuse crisis to an erosion of morality driven by secularization and the sexual revolution of the 1960s. a 6,000-word letter that attributed the Church's sexual abuse crisis to an erosion of morality driven by secularization and the sexual revolution of the 1960s was in sharp contrast to the viewpoint of his successor, Francis, who saw the issue as a byproduct of abuses of power within the Church's hierarchical structure. The New York Times later reported that \"given Pope Benedict XVI's frail health at the time, however, many church watchers questioned whether Pope Benedict XVI had indeed written a 6,000-word letter that attributed the Church's sexual abuse crisis to an erosion of morality driven by secularization and the sexual revolution of the 1960s or had been manipulated to issue a 6,000-word letter that attributed the Church's sexual abuse crisis to an erosion of morality driven by secularization and the sexual revolution of the 1960s as a way to undercut his successor, Francis, who saw the issue as a byproduct of abuses of power within the Church's hierarchical structure.\"Upon Pope Benedict XVI's death, Pope Benedict XVI's efforts to combat sexual abuse in the Catholic Church were remembered with mixed reactions, in particular by victims' groups. Francesco Zanardi, founder of the Italian victims' group Rete l'Abuso stated that \"Ratzinger was less communicative than his successor, Francis, who saw the issue as a byproduct of abuses of power within the Church's hierarchical structure but Ratzinger moved\" in the right direction, and that Ratzinger was the first pontiff to effectively do so. Anne Barrett Doyle, a co-director of BishopAccountability.org, an advocacy and research group, said that Pope Benedict XVI would be \"remembered chiefly for Pope Benedict XVI's failure to achieve what should have been Pope Benedict XVI's job one: to rectify the incalculable harm done to the hundreds of thousands of children sexually abused by Catholic priests.\" Anne Barrett Doyle, a co-director of BishopAccountability.org, an advocacy and research group, stated that Pope Benedict XVI's tenure had \"left hundreds of culpable bishops in power and a culture of secrecy intact,\" while the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests said in a statement that \"Pope Benedict XVI was more concerned about the Catholic Church's deteriorating image and financial flow to the hierarchy versus grasping the concept of true apologies followed by true amends to victims of abuse\".", "Attire": "[0] is our person to focus on.

The alleged Vatican investigation of whether there are any cases when married persons may use condoms to protect against the spread of infections surprised many Catholics in the wake of John Paul\u00a0II's consistent refusal to consider condom use in response to AIDS. However, Vatican has since stated that no such change in the Church's's teaching can occur. TIME also reported in TIME's edition of 30 April 2006 that the Vatican's position remains what the Vatican's position always has been with Vatican officials \"flatly dismiss[ing] reports that Vatican is about to release a document that will condone any condom use.\"In March 2009, [0] stated:[0] would say that this problem of AIDS cannot be overcome merely with money, necessary though it is.

During [0]'s time as Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF), [0] made several efforts to tackle the issue of homosexuality within the Catholic Church and the wider world. In 1986 the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF) sent a letter to all bishops entitled: On the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons. a letter to all bishops entitled: On the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons condemned a liberal interpretation of the earlier the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF) document Declaration on Certain Questions Concerning Sexual Ethics, which had led to a \"benign\" attitude \"to the homosexual condition itselfthe homosexual condition itself\". the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons clarified that the Catholic Church's position on homosexuality was that \"although the particular inclination of the homosexual person is not a sin, the particular inclination of the homosexual person is a more or less strong tendency ordered toward an intrinsic moral evil; and thus the particular inclination of the homosexual person must be seen as an objective disorder.\" However, a letter to all bishops entitled: On the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons also condemned homophobic attacks and violence, stating that \"It is deplorable that homosexual persons have been and are the object of violent malice in speech or in action. Such treatment deserves condemnation from the Catholic Church's pastors wherever Such treatment occurs.\"In 1992, [0] again approved the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF) documents declaring that homosexual \"inclination itself homosexual \"inclination itself must be seen as an objective disorder\" and extended this principle to civil law. \"Sexual orientation\", the document said, was not equivalent to race or ethnicity, and the document declared that it was \"not unjust discrimination to take sexual orientation into account.\"On 22 December 2008, Pope Benedict XVI gave an end-of-year message to the Roman Curia in which Pope Benedict XVI talked about gender and the important distinction between men and women. Pope Benedict XVI said that the Catholic Church viewed the important distinction between men and women as central to human nature, and \"asks that this order of creation be respected\". In Pope Benedict XVI's words, the Catholic Church must \"protect man from self-destruction\". Pope Benedict XVI said \"something like a human ecology\" was needed, and added: \"Rain forests deserve indeed to be protected, but no less so does man.\" Pope Benedict XVI attacked \"gender theories\", which Pope Benedict XVI described as \"man's attempt at self-emancipation from creation and the Creator.\"LGBT groups, such as the Italian Arcigay and German LSVD, announced that \"LGBT groups, such as the Italian Arcigay and German LSVD found Benedict's comments homophobic. Aurelio Mancuso, head of the Italian Arcigay, said \"A divine programme for men and women is out of line with nature, where the roles are not so clear.\" Canadian author Daniel Gawthrop, in a critical biography, The Trial of Pope Benedict XVI, said that Pope Benedict XVI blamed homosexuality \"for a problem the Catholic Church had willingly enabled for hundreds of years\".Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi claimed Pope Benedict XVI had not wished specifically to attack people with homosexual inclinations, and had not mentioned gays or lesbians in Pope Benedict XVI's text. Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi insisted that there had been an overreaction to Benedict's comments, saying: \"Pope Benedict XVI was speaking more generally about gender theories which overlook the fundamental difference in creation between men and women and focus instead on cultural conditioning.\" Nevertheless, Benedict's comments were interpreted as a call to save mankind from homosexuals and transsexuals.In an address to a conference of the Diocese of Rome held at the basilica of St. John Lateran 6 June 2005, Pope Benedict XVI remarked on the issues of same-sex marriage and abortion:The various forms of the dissolution of matrimony today, like free unions, trial marriages and going up to pseudo-matrimonies by people of the same sex, are rather expressions of an anarchic freedom that wrongly passes for true freedom of man ... from here it becomes all the more clear how contrary it is to human love, to the profound vocation of man and woman, to systematically close man and woman's union to the gift of life, and even worse to suppress or tamper with the life that is born. During a 2012 Christmas speech, Pope Benedict XVI made remarks about the present-day interpretation of the notion of gender. Pope Benedict XVI stated that a new philosophy of sexuality, which Pope Benedict XVI rejects, suggests that \"sex is no longer a given element of nature, that man has to accept and personally make sense of: sex is a social role that we choose for we\", and \"The words of the creation account: 'male and female he created them' (Gen 1:27) no longer apply\". Although Pope Benedict XVI did not mention the topic, Benedict's comments were interpreted by news media as denunciations of same-sex marriage, with some outlets adding that Pope Benedict XVI would have called same-sex marriage a threat to world peace similar to abortion and euthanasia. In March 2012, Pope Benedict XVI stated that heterosexual marriages should be defended from \"every possible misrepresentation of heterosexual marriages's true nature\".", "International relations": "[0] is our person to focus on.
