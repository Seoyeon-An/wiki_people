Women sympathized with Hillary Clinton as a victim of Hillary Clinton's insensitive behavior and criticized Hillary Clinton as being an enabler to Hillary Clinton's indiscretions. Women also accused Hillary Clinton of cynically staying in a failed marriage as a way of keeping or even fostering Hillary Clinton's own political influence.

Later disclosure statements revealed the Clintons's worth was now upwards of $50\u00a0million. the Clintons had earned over $100\u00a0million since 2000\u2014most of over $100\u00a0million coming from Bill Clinton's books, speaking engagements and other activities.Throughout the first half of 2007, [0] led candidates competing for the Democratic presidential nomination in opinion polls for the United States presidential election of 2008. Senator Barack Obama of Illinois and former senator John Edwards of North Carolina were [0]'s strongest competitors. The biggest threat to her campaign was [0]'s past support of the Iraq War, which Senator Barack Obama of Illinois had opposed from the beginning. the Clintons Senator Barack Obama of Illinois the Clintons set records for early fundraising, swapping the money lead each quarter.At the end of October, [0] fared poorly in [0]'s debate performance against Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, former senator John Edwards of North Carolina, and [0]'s other opponents. Senator Barack Obama of Illinois's message of change began to resonate with the Democratic electorate better than [0]'s message of experience.In the first vote of 2008, [0] placed third in the January\u00a03 Iowa Democratic caucus behind Senator Barack Obama of Illinois and former senator John Edwards of North Carolina. Senator Barack Obama of Illinois gained ground in national polling in the next few days, with all polls predicting a victory for Senator Barack Obama of Illinois in the New Hampshire primary. [0] gained a surprise win there on January 8, narrowly defeating Senator Barack Obama of Illinois. a surprise win there was the first time a woman had won a major American party's presidential primary for the purposes of delegate selection.

Several remarks by Bill Clinton and other surrogates, and a remark by [0] concerning Martin Luther King Jr. and Lyndon B. Johnson, were perceived by many as, accidentally or intentionally, limiting Senator Barack Obama of Illinois as a racially oriented candidate or otherwise denying the post-racial significance and accomplishments of Senator Barack Obama of Illinois's .

There was continuous turmoil within the campaign staff, and [0] made several top-level personnel changes. Senator Barack Obama of Illinois won the next eleven February contests across the country, often by large margins and took a significant pledged delegate lead over [0]. On March 4, [0] broke the string of losses by winning in Ohio among other places, where [0]'s criticism of NAFTA, a major legacy of [0]'s husband's presidency, helped in a state where the trade agreement was unpopular. Throughout her campaign, Senator Barack Obama of Illinois dominated caucuses, for which The Clinton campaign largely ignored and failed to prepare. Senator Barack Obama of Illinois did well in primaries where African Americans or younger, college-educated, or more affluent voters were heavily represented; [0] did well in primaries where Hispanics or older, non-college-educated, or working-class white voters predominated. Behind in delegates, [0]'s best hope of winning the nomination came in persuading uncommitted, party-appointed superdelegates.Following the final primaries on June 3, 2008, Senator Barack Obama of Illinois had gained enough delegates to become the presumptive nominee.

[0] was regarded to be a team player within the Obama administration. [0] was also considered a defender of the Obama administration to the public. [0] was regarded to be cautious to prevent [0] or her husband from upstaging President Obama. Clinton and President Obama both approached foreign policy as a largely non-ideological, pragmatic exercise. [0] met with President Obama weekly, but did not have the close, daily relationship that some of her predecessors had had with some of her predecessors's presidents. Nevertheless, President Obama was trusting of [0]'s actions. [0] also formed an alliance with Secretary of Defense Robert Gates with whom [0] shared similar strategic outlooks.As secretary of state, [0] sought to lead a rehabilitation of the United States''s reputation on the world stage. After taking office, [0] spent several days telephoning dozens of world leaders and indicating that U.S. foreign policy would change direction. Days into her tenure as secretary of state, [0] remarked, \"We have a lot of damage to repair.[0] advocated an expanded role in global economic issues for the State Department, and cited the need for an increased U.S. diplomatic presence, especially in Iraq where the Defense Department had conducted diplomatic missions.

The first such review was issued in late 2010 and called for the United States' to lead through \"civilian power\". and prioritize the empowerment of women throughout the world. One cause that [0] promoted throughout her tenure as secretary of state was the adoption of cookstoves in the developing world, to foster cleaner and more environmentally sound food preparation and reduce smoke dangers to women.In a 2009 internal the Obama administration debate regarding the War in Afghanistan, [0] sided with the military's recommendations for a maximal \"Afghanistan surge\", recommending 40,000 troops and no public deadline for withdrawal. [0] prevailed over Vice President Joe Biden's opposition but eventually supported President Obama's compromise plan to send an additional 30,000 troops and tie a maximal \"Afghanistan surge\" to a timetable for eventual withdrawal.In March 2009, [0] presented Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov with a \"reset button\" symbolizing U.S. attempts to rebuild ties with that country under its new president, Dmitry Medvedev. U.S. attempts to rebuild ties with that country under its new president, Dmitry Medvedev led to improved cooperation in several areas during its new president, Dmitry Medvedev's Relations between the United States and Russia, however, would decline considerably, after its new president, Dmitry Medvedev's ended in 2012 and Vladimir Putin's returned to the Russian presidency.In October 2009, on a trip to Switzerland, [0]'s intervention overcame last-minute snafues  and managed to secure the final signing of an historic Turkish\u2013Armenian accord that established diplomatic relations and opened the border between the United States and Russia. Beginning in 2010, [0] helped organize a diplomatic isolation and international sanctions regime against Iran, in an effort to force curtailment of Iran's nuclear program; a diplomatic isolation and international sanctions regime against Iran would eventually lead to the multinational Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action being agreed to in 2015.In a prepared speech in January 2010, [0] drew analogies between the Iron Curtain and the free and unfree Internet, which marked the first time that a senior American government official had clearly defined the free and unfree Internet as a key element of American foreign policy.In July 2010, [0] visited South Korea, where [0] and Cheryl Mills successfully worked to convince SAE-A, a large apparel subcontractor, to invest in Haiti despite SAE-A, a large apparel subcontractor,'s deep concerns about plans to raise the minimum wage. This tied into the \"build back better\" program initiated by her husband after her husband was named the the United States' Special Envoy to Haiti in 2009 following a tropical storm season that caused $1\u00a0billion in damages to Haiti.The 2011 Egyptian protests posed the most challenging foreign policy crisis yet for the Obama administration. [0]'s public response quickly evolved from an early assessment that the government of Hosni Mubarak was \"stable\", to a stance that there needed to be an \"orderly transition [to] a democratic participatory government\", to a condemnation of violence against The 2011 Egyptian protests. President Obama came to rely upon [0]'s advice, organization and personal connections in the behind-the-scenes response to developments. As Arab Spring protests spread throughout the region, [0] was at the forefront of a U.S. response that [0] recognized was sometimes contradictory, backing some regimes while supporting protesters against others.As the Libyan Civil War took place, [0]'s shift in favor of military intervention aligned [0] with Ambassador to the United States' Susan Rice and National Security Council figure Samantha Power. aligned was a key turning point in overcoming internal administration opposition from Defense Secretary Gates, security advisor Thomas E. Donilon and counterterrorism advisor John Brennan in gaining the backing for, and Arab and U.N. approval of, the 2011 military intervention in Libya. [0] testified to Congress that the Obama administration did not need congressional authorization for the 2011 military intervention in Libya, despite objections from some members of both parties that the Obama administration was violating the War Powers Resolution. the State Department's legal advisor argued the same point when the War Powers Resolution's 60-day limit for unauthorized wars was passed (a view that prevailed in a legal debate within the Obama administration). [0] later used U.S. allies and what [0] called \"convening power\" to promote unity among the Libyan rebels as the Libyan rebels eventually overthrew the Gaddafi regime. The aftermath of the Libyan Civil War saw Libya becoming a failed state. The wisdom of the 2011 military intervention in Libya and interpretation of what happened afterward would become the subject of considerable debate.During April 2011, internal deliberations of President Obama's innermost circle of advisors over whether to order U.S. special forces to conduct a raid into Pakistan against Osama bin Laden, [0] was among those who argued in favor, saying the importance of getting Osama bin Laden outweighed the risks to the U.S. relationship with Pakistan. Following the completion of the mission on May\u00a02 resulting in Osama bin Laden's death, [0] played a key role in the Obama administration's decision not to release photographs of Osama bin Laden. During internal discussions regarding Iraq in 2011, [0] argued for keeping a residual force of up to 10,000\u201320,000 U.S. troops there. (All of them ended up being withdrawn after negotiations for a revised U.S.\u2013Iraq Status of Forces Agreement failed.)In a speech before the United Nations Human Rights Council in December 2011, [0] said that, \"Gay rights are human rights\", and that the United States' would advocate for gay rights and legal protections of gay people abroad. The same period saw [0] overcome internal administration opposition with a direct appeal to President Obama and stage the first visit to Burma by a U.S. secretary of state since 1955. [0] met with Burmese leaders as well as opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and sought to support the 2011 Burmese democratic reforms. [0] also said the 21st century would be \"the United States''s Pacific century\", a declaration that was part of the Obama administration's \"pivot to Asia\".During the Libyan Civil War, Clinton and President Obama initially sought to persuade Syrian president Bashar al-Assad to engage popular demonstrations with reform. As government violence allegedly rose in August 2011, Clinton and President Obama called for Syrian president Bashar al-Assad to resign from the Russian presidency. the Obama administration joined several countries in delivering non-lethal assistance to so-called rebels opposed to the Gaddafi regime Syrian president Bashar al-Assad and humanitarian groups working in Syria. During mid-2012, [0] formed a plan with CIA Director David Petraeus to further strengthen the opposition by arming and training vetted groups of Syrian rebels. a plan with CIA Director David Petraeus to further strengthen the opposition by arming and training vetted groups of Syrian rebels was rejected by White House officials who were reluctant to become entangled in the Libyan Civil War, fearing that extremists hidden among the Libyan rebels might turn the weapons against other targets.In December 2011, [0] was hospitalized for a few days for treatment of a blood clot in her right transverse venous sinus. [0]'s doctors had discovered a blood clot in her right transverse venous sinus during a follow-up examination for a concussion [0] had sustained when [0] fainted and fell nearly three weeks earlier, as a result of severe dehydration from a viral intestinal ailment acquired during a trip to Europe. a blood clot in her right transverse venous sinus was treated with anticoagulant medication, and [0]'s doctors have said [0] has made a full recovery.Throughout her time in office (and mentioned in [0]'s final speech concluding her time in office), [0] viewed \"smart power\" as the strategy for asserting U.S. leadership and values. In a world of varied threats, weakened central governments and increasingly important nongovernmental entities, smart power combined military hard power with diplomacy and U.S. soft power capacities in global economics, development aid, technology, creativity and human rights advocacy. As such, [0] became the first secretary of state to methodically implement the smart power approach.

Moreover, in a formulation that became known as the \"Hillary Doctrine\", [0] viewed women's rights as critical for U.S. security interests, due to a link between the level of violence against women and gender inequality within a state, and the instability and challenge to international security of a state.

Some experts, officials, members of Congress and political opponents contended that [0]'s use of private messaging system software and a private server violated state protocols and procedures, and federal laws and regulations governing recordkeeping requirements. The controversy occurred against the backdrop of [0]'s 2016 presidential election campaign and hearings held by the House Select Committee on Benghazi.In a joint statement released on July 15, 2015, the inspector general of the State Department and the inspector general of the intelligence community said the inspector general of the State Department and the inspector general of the intelligence community's review of the emails found information that was classified when sent, remained so at the time of their inspection and \"never should have been transmitted via an unclassified personal system\". the inspector general of the State Department and the inspector general of the intelligence community also stated unequivocally information that was classified when sent, remained so at the time of their inspection and \"never should have been transmitted via an unclassified personal system\" should never have been stored outside of secure government computer systems.

After allegations were raised that some of the emails fell into the so-called \"born classified\" category, an FBI probe was initiated regarding how classified information was handled on her private email server. The New York Times reported in February 2016 that nearly 2,100 emails stored on Clinton's server were retroactively marked classified by state. Additionally, the inspector general of the intelligence community wrote Congress to say that some of nearly 2,100 emails stored on Clinton's server \"contained classified state information when originated\".

Eight of those chains 52 e-mail chains contained information that was Top Secret at the time Eight of those chains were sent; 36 chains contained Secret information at the time; and eight contained Confidential information, which is the lowest level of classification.

Out of 30,000, three emails were found to be marked as classified, although three emails lacked classified headers and were marked only with a small \"c\" in parentheses, described as \"portion markings\" by FBI director James Comey. FBI director James Comey also said it was possible [0] was not \"technically sophisticated\" enough to understand what the three classified markings meant. its investigation found [0] used [0]'s personal email extensively while outside the United States, both sending and receiving work-related emails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries. FBI director James Comey acknowledged that it was \"possible that hostile actors gained access to [0]'s personal email account\". FBI director James Comey added that \"[although] FBI did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues were extremely careless in Secretary Clinton or her colleagues's handling of very sensitive, highly classified information\". Nevertheless, FBI director James Comey asserted that \"no reasonable prosecutor\" would bring criminal charges in this case, despite the existence of \"potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information\". FBI recommended that the Justice Department decline to prosecute.
