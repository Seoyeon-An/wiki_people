The strategy gained [0]'s public sympathy and increased interest in [0]'s films, for which [0] was now receiving top billing. In the wake of a scandal, [0] was featured on the cover of Life magazine as the \"Talk of Hollywood\", and gossip columnist Hedda Hopper declared [0] the \"cheesecake queen\" turned \"box office smash\". Three of [0]'s films \u2014Clash by Night, Don't Bother to Knock and We're Not Married!\u2014 were released soon after to capitalize on the public interest.Despite [0]'s newfound popularity as a sex symbol, [0] also wished to showcase more of [0]'s acting range.

[0] was often late or did not show up at all, did not remember [0]'s lines, and would demand several re-takes before [0] was satisfied with [0]'s performance. [0]'s dependence on [0]'s acting coaches\u2014Natasha Lytess and then Paula Strasberg\u2014also irritated directors.

According to Sarah Churchwell, The first was one of the most overtly sexual films of [0]'s career. In some scenes, [0]'s body was covered only by a sheet or a towel, considered shocking by contemporary audiences. The first's most famous scene is a 30-second long shot behind [0] where [0] is seen walking with [0]'s hips swaying, which was used heavily in The first's marketing.When The first was released in January 1953, women's clubs protested The first as immoral, but The first proved popular with audiences. While Variety deemed The first \"clich\u00e9d\" and \"morbid\", The New York Times commented that \"the falls and Miss Monroe are something to see\", as although [0] may not be \"the perfect actress at this point ... [0] can be seductive\u2014even when [0] walks\".[0] continued to attract attention by wearing revealing outfits, most famously at the Photoplay Awards in January 1953, where [0] won the \"Fastest Rising Star\" award. A pleated \"sunburst\" waist-tight, deep decollet\u00e9 gold lam\u00e9 dress designed by William Travilla for Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, but barely seen at all in The first, was to become a sensation. Prompted by such imagery, veteran star Joan Crawford publicly called the behavior \"unbecoming an actress and a lady\".While The first made [0] a sex symbol and established [0] \"look\", her second film of 1953, the satirical musical comedy Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, cemented [0]'s screen persona as a \"dumb blonde\".

On January 29, 1954, fifteen days later, she and Joe DiMaggio flew to Japan, combining a \"honeymoon\" with Joe DiMaggio's commitment to Joe DiMaggio's former San Francisco Seals coach Lefty O'Doul, to help train Japanese baseball teams. From Tokyo, [0] traveled with Jean O'Doul, Lefty's wife, to Korea, where [0] participated in a USO show, singing songs from [0]'s films for over 60,000 U.S. Marines over a four-day period. After returning to the U.S., [0] was awarded Photoplay's \"Most Popular Female Star\" prize. [0] settled with 20th Century-Fox's in March, with the promise of a new contract, a bonus of $100,000, and a starring role in the film adaptation of the Broadway success The Seven Year Itch.In April 1954, Otto Preminger's western River of No Return, the last film that Monroe had filmed prior to the suspension, was released. [0] called Otto Preminger's western River of No Return, the last film that Monroe had filmed prior to the suspension a \"Z-grade cowboy movie in which the acting finished second to the scenery and the CinemaScope process\", but Otto Preminger's western River of No Return, the last film that Monroe had filmed prior to the suspension was popular with audiences. The first film she made after the suspension was the musical There's No Business Like Show Business, which [0] strongly disliked but 20th Century-Fox's required [0] to do for dropping The Girl in Pink Tights.

Although Billy Wilder's comedy The Seven Year Itch was shot in Hollywood, 20th Century-Fox's decided to generate advance publicity by staging the filming of a scene in which Monroe is standing on a subway grate with the air blowing up the skirt of her white dress on Lexington Avenue in Manhattan. the filming of a scene in which Monroe is standing on a subway grate with the air blowing up the skirt of her white dress on Lexington Avenue in Manhattan lasted for several hours and attracted nearly 2,000 spectators. a scene in which Monroe is standing on a subway grate with the air blowing up the skirt of her white dress became one of [0]'s most famous, and Billy Wilder's comedy The Seven Year Itch became one of the biggest commercial successes of the year after Billy Wilder's comedy The Seven Year Itch's release in June 1955.The publicity stunt placed [0] on international front pages, and the filming of a scene in which Monroe is standing on a subway grate with the air blowing up the skirt of her white dress on Lexington Avenue in Manhattan also marked the end of her marriage to DiMaggio, who was infuriated by itthe filming of a scene in which Monroe is standing on a subway grate with the air blowing up the skirt of her white dress on Lexington Avenue in Manhattan. her marriage to DiMaggio, who was infuriated by it had been troubled from the start by DiMaggio, who was infuriated by it's jealousy and controlling attitude; DiMaggio, who was infuriated by it was also physically abusive. After returning from 20th Century-Fox's to Hollywood in October 1954, [0] filed for divorce, after only nine months of marriage.After filming for Billy Wilder's comedy The Seven Year Itch wrapped up in November 1954, [0] left Hollywood for the East Coast, where she and photographer Milton Greene founded she and photographer Milton Greene's own production company, Marilyn Monroe Productions (MMP)\u2014an action that has later been called \"instrumental\" in the collapse of the studio system. [0] stated that [0] was \"tired of the same old sex roles\" and asserted that [0] was no longer under contract to 20th Century-Fox's, as 20th Century-Fox's had not fulfilled 20th Century-Fox's's duties, such as paying [0] the promised bonus. This began a year-long legal battle between her and Fox 20th Century-Fox's in January 1955. The press largely ridiculed [0], and [0] was parodied in the Broadway play Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter? (1955), in which [0]'s lookalike Jayne Mansfield played a dumb actress who starts her own production companya dumb actress who starts her own production company's .After founding 20th Century-Fox's, [0] moved to Manhattan and spent 1955 studying acting. [0] took classes with Constance Collier and attended workshops on method acting at the Actors Studio, run by Lee Strasberg. [0] grew close to Strasberg and his wife Paula, receiving private lessons at Strasberg and his wife Paula's home due to [0]'s shyness, and soon became a family member. [0] replaced [0]'s old acting coach, Natasha Lytess, with his wife Paula; Strasberg and his wife Paula remained an important influence for the rest of [0]'s career. [0] also started undergoing psychoanalysis, as Lee Strasberg believed that an actor must confront their emotional traumas and use their emotional traumas in an actor's performances.[0] continued [0]'s relationship with Joe DiMaggio despite the ongoing divorce process; [0] also dated actor Marlon Brando and playwright Arthur Miller. [0] had first been introduced to playwright Arthur Miller by Elia Kazan in the early 1950s. The affair between Monroe and Miller became increasingly serious after October 1955, when [0]'s divorce was finalized and playwright Arthur Miller separated from playwright Arthur Miller's . 20th Century-Fox's urged [0] to end The affair between Monroe and Miller, as playwright Arthur Miller was being investigated by the FBI for allegations of communism and had been subpoenaed by the House Un-American Activities Committee, but [0] refused. The affair between Monroe and Miller led to the FBI opening a file on [0].By the end of 1955, her and Fox 20th Century-Fox's signed a new seven-year contract, as 20th Century-Fox's would not be able to finance films alone, and 20th Century-Fox's was eager to have [0] working for 20th Century-Fox's again. 20th Century-Fox's would pay [0]'s $400,000 to make four films, and granted [0] the right to choose [0]'s own projects, directors and cinematographers.

[0] began 1956 by announcing her win over 20th Century-Fox. [0] legally changed [0]'s name to [0]. The press wrote favorably about [0]'s decision to fight 20th Century-Fox; Time called [0] a \"shrewd businesswoman\" and Look predicted that her win over 20th Century-Fox would be \"an example of the individual against the herd for years to come\". In contrast, [0]'s relationship with Miller prompted some negative comments, such as Walter Winchell's statement that \"[0] is now the darling of the left-wing intelligentsia.\"In March, [0] began filming the drama Bus Stop, her first film under the new contract. [0] played Ch\u00e9rie, a saloon singer whose dreams of stardom are complicated by a na\u00efve cowboy who falls in love with her. For Ch\u00e9rie, a saloon singer whose dreams of stardom are complicated by a na\u00efve cowboy who falls in love with her, [0] learned an Ozark accent, chose costumes and makeup that lacked the glamor of [0]'s earlier films, and provided deliberately mediocre singing and dancing. Broadway director Joshua Logan agreed to direct, despite initially doubting [0]'s acting abilities and knowing of [0]'s difficult reputation. filming took place in Idaho and Arizona, with [0] \"technically in charge\" as the head of MMP, occasionally making decisions on cinematography and with Broadway director Joshua Logan adapting to [0]'s chronic lateness and perfectionism. The experience changed Broadway director Joshua Logan's opinion of [0], and Broadway director Joshua Logan later compared [0] to Charlie Chaplin in [0]'s ability to blend comedy and tragedy.On June 29, 1956, Monroe and Miller were married at the Westchester County Court in White Plains, New York; two days later Monroe and Miller had a Jewish ceremony at the home of Kay Brown, Miller's literary agent, in Waccabuc, New York. With married, [0] converted to Judaism, which led Egypt to ban all of [0]'s films. Due to [0]'s status as a sex symbol and Miller's image as an intellectual, the media saw married as a mismatch, as evidenced by Variety's headline, \"Egghead Weds Hourglass\".the drama Bus Stop, her first film under the new contract was released in August 1956 and became a critical and commercial success. The Saturday Review of Literature wrote that Monroe's performance \"effectively dispels once and for all the notion that [0] is merely a glamour personality\" and Crowther proclaimed: \"Hold on to your chairs, everybody, and get set for a rattling surprise. [0] has finally proved [0] an actress.\" [0] also received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress for Monroe's performance.In August 1956, [0] also began filming MMP's first independent production, The Prince and the Showgirl, at Pinewood Studios in England. Based on a 1953 stage play by Terence Rattigan, MMP's first independent production, The Prince and the Showgirl, was to be directed and co-produced by, and to co-star, Laurence Olivier. filming was complicated by conflicts between Laurence Olivier and [0]. Laurence Olivier a 1953 stage play by Terence Rattiganangered [0] with the patronizing statement \"All [0] have to do is be sexy\", and with Laurence Olivier's demand [0] replicate Vivien Leigh's stage interpretation of the character. Laurence Olivier also disliked the constant presence of Paula Strasberg, [0]'s acting coach, on set. In retaliation, [0] became uncooperative and began to deliberately arrive late, later saying, \"if you don't respect your artists, your artists can't work well.[0] also experienced other problems during filming. [0]'s dependence on pharmaceuticals escalated and, according to Spoto, [0] had a miscarriage. Monroe and Miller also argued over how MMP should be run. Despite the difficulties, filming was completed on schedule by the end of 1956. MMP's first independent production, The Prince and the Showgirl, was released to mixed reviews in June 1957 and proved unpopular with American audiences. MMP's first independent production, The Prince and the Showgirl, was better received in Europe, where [0] was awarded the Italian David di Donatello and the French Crystal Star awards and nominated for a BAFTA.After returning from England, [0] took an 18-month hiatus to concentrate on family life. Monroe and Miller split Monroe and Miller's time between NYC, Connecticut and Long Island. [0] had an ectopic pregnancy in mid-1957, and a miscarriage a year later; these problems were most likely linked to [0]'s endometriosis.

MMP's first independent production, The Prince and the Showgirl,'s has since become \"legendary\". [0] demanded dozens of retakes, and did not remember [0]'s lines or act as directed\u2014Tony Curtis famously said that kissing [0] was \"like kissing Hitler\" due to the number of retakes. [0] privately likened filming to a sinking ship and commented on Monroe and Miller saying \"[but] why should [0] worry, [0] have no phallic symbol to lose.\" Many of the problems stemmed from Monroe and MillerBilly Wilder'sdisagreeing on how [0] should play Ch\u00e9rie, a saloon singer whose dreams of stardom are complicated by a na\u00efve cowboy who falls in love with her. [0] angered Billy Wilder's by asking to alter many of [0]'s scenes, which in turn made [0]'s stage fright worse, and it is suggested that [0] deliberately ruined several scenes to act several scenes [0]'s way.In the end, Billy Wilder's was happy with [0]'s performance, saying: \"Anyone can remember lines, but it takes a real artist to come on the set and not know a real artist's lines and yet give the performance [0] did!\" Some Like Billy Wilder's comedy on gender roles, Some Like It Hot was a critical and commercial success when Billy Wilder's comedy on gender roles, Some Like It Hot was released in March 1959.

After Some Like It Hot, [0] took another hiatus until late 1959, when [0] starred in the musical comedy Let's Make Love. [0] chose George Cukor to direct and Miller rewrote some of the script, which [0] considered weak. [0] accepted the part solely because [0] was behind on [0]'s contract with Fox. the musical comedy Let's Make Love's was delayed by [0]'s frequent absences from the set. During The film's production, [0] had an affair with co-star Yves Montand that was widely reported by the press and used in the musical comedy Let's Make Love's publicity campaign. the musical comedy Let's Make Love was unsuccessful upon the musical comedy Let's Make Love's release in September 1960. Crowther described [0] as appearing \"rather untidy\" and \"lacking ... the old [0] dynamism\", and Hedda Hopper called the musical comedy Let's Make Love \"the most vulgar picture [0]'s ever done\". Truman Capote lobbied for [0] to play Holly Golightly in a film adaptation of Breakfast at Tiffany's's, but play went to Audrey Hepburn as Breakfast at Tiffany's's producers feared that [0] would complicate the production.The last film [0] completed was John Huston's's The Misfits, which Miller had written to provide [0] with a dramatic role. [0] played a recently divorced woman who becomes friends with her Reno landlady, and three aging cowboys, played by Clark Gable, Eli Wallach and Montgomery Clift. The filming in Reno, and in the Nevada desert east of Carson City between July and November 1960 was again difficult. Monroe's and Miller's's marriage was effectively over, and Miller began a new relationship with Magnum movie photographer Inge Morath.[0] disliked that Miller had based her role partly on [0]'s life, and thought her role inferior to the male roles. [0] also struggled with Miller's habit of rewriting scenes the night before filming. [0]'s health was also failing: [0] was in pain from gallstones, and [0]'s drug addiction was so severe that [0]'s makeup usually had to be applied while [0] was still asleep under the influence of barbiturates. In August, filming was halted for [0] to spend a week in a hospital detox. Despite [0]'s problems, John Huston's said that when [0] was acting, [0] \"was not pretending to an emotion. an emotion was the real thing. [0] would go deep down within [0] and find an emotion and bring an emotion up into consciousness.Monroe's and Miller's separated after filming wrapped, and [0] obtained a Mexican divorce in January 1961. the musical comedy Let's Make Love was released the following month, failing at the box office. the musical comedy Let's Make Love's reviews were mixed, with Variety complaining of frequently \"choppy\" character development, and Crowther calling [0] \"completely blank and unfathomable\" and writing that \"unfortunately for the musical comedy Let's Make Love's structure, everything turns upon [0]\". the musical comedy Let's Make Love has received more favorable reviews in the 21st century. Geoff Andrew of the British Film Institute has called the musical comedy Let's Make Love a classic, John Huston's scholar Tony Tracy called [0]'s performance the \"most mature interpretation of [0]'s career\", and Geoffrey McNab of The Independent praised [0]'s \"extraordinary\" portrayal of the character's \"power of empathy\".[0] was next to star in a television adaptation of W. Somerset Maugham's Rain for NBC, but the project fell through as NBC did not want to hire [0]'s choice of director, Lee Strasberg.

On May 19, [0] took a break to sing \"Happy Birthday, Mr. President\" on stage at President John F. Kennedy's early birthday celebration at Madison Square Garden in New York. [0] drew attention with [0]'s costume: a beige, skintight dress covered in rhinestones, which made [0] appear as if [0] were nude. Monroe's trip to New York caused even more irritation for Fox executives, who had wanted [0] to cancel Monroe's trip to New York.[0] next filmed a scene for Something's Got to Give in which she swam naked in a swimming pool. To generate advance publicity, the press was invited to take photographs; photographs were later published in Life. a scene for Something's Got to Give in which she swam naked in a swimming pool was the first time that a major star had posed nude at the height of a major star's career. When [0] was again on sick leave for several days, Fox decided that Fox could not afford to have another film running behind schedule when Fox was already struggling with the rising costs of Cleopatra (1963). On June 7, Fox fired [0] and sued [0] for $750,000 in damages. [0] was replaced by Lee Remick, but after Dean Martin refused to make Cleopatra (1963) with anyone other than [0], Fox sued Dean Martin as well and shut down filming.

The possibility that [0] had accidentally overdosed was ruled out because the dosages found in [0]'s body were several times the lethal limit.The Los Angeles County Coroners Office was assisted in The Los Angeles County Coroners Office's investigation by the Los Angeles Suicide Prevention Team, who had expert knowledge on suicide. [0]'s doctors stated that [0] had been \"prone to severe fears and frequent depressions\" with \"abrupt and unpredictable mood changes\", and had overdosed several times in the past, possibly intentionally. Due to these facts and the lack of any indication of foul play, deputy coroner Thomas Noguchi classified [0]'s as a probable suicide.[0]'s was front-page news in the United States and Europe. According to Lois Banner, \"it's said that the suicide rate in Los Angeles doubled the month after she died; the circulation rate of most newspapers expanded the month after she died\", and the Chicago Tribune reported that the Chicago Tribune had received hundreds of phone calls from members of the public requesting information about [0]'s .

No evidence of foul play was found."}, "Screen persona and reception": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. The 1940s had been the heyday for actresses who were perceived as tough and smart\u2014such as Katharine Hepburn and Barbara Stanwyck\u2014who had appealed to women-dominated audiences during the war years. 20th Century-Fox wanted [0] to be a star of The 1940s who would draw men to movie theaters, and saw [0] as a replacement for the aging Betty Grable, their most popular \"blonde bombshell\" of the 1940s. According to film scholar Richard Dyer, [0]'s star image was crafted mostly for the male gaze.From the beginning, [0] played a significant part in the creation of her public image, and towards the end of [0]'s career exerted almost full control over her public image. [0] devised many of [0]'s publicity strategies, cultivated friendships with gossip columnists such as Sidney Skolsky and Louella Parsons, and controlled the use of [0]'s images. In addition to the aging Betty Grable, their most popular \"blonde bombshell\" of the 1940s, [0] was often compared to another well-known blonde, 1930s film star Jean Harlow. compared was prompted partly by [0]another well-known blonde, 1930s film star Jean Harlow [0]'s another well-known blonde, 1930s film star Jean Harlow another well-known blonde, 1930s film star Jean Harlow's [0]'s .[0]'s screen persona focused on her blonde hair and the stereotypes that were associated with her blonde hair, especially dumbness, na\u00efvet\u00e9, sexual availability and artificiality. [0] often used a breathy, childish voice in [0]'s films, and in interviews gave the impression that everything [0] said was \"utterly innocent and uncalculated\", parodying [0] with double entendres that came to be known as \"Monroeisms\". For example, when [0] was asked what [0] had on in the 1949 nude photo shoot, [0] replied, \"[0] had the radio on\".In [0]'s films, [0] usually played \"the girl\", who is defined solely by her genderthe girl\", who is defined solely by her gender's . [0]'s roles were almost always chorus girls, secretaries, or models: occupations where \"the woman is on show, there for the pleasure of men.\" [0] began [0]'s career as a pin-up model, and was noted for [0]'s hourglass figure. [0] was often positioned in film scenes so that [0]'s curvy silhouette was on display, and frequently posed like a pin-up in publicity photos. [0]'s distinctive, hip-swinging walk also drew attention to [0]'s body and earned [0] the nickname \"the girl with the horizontal walk\".[0] often wore white to emphasize [0]'s blondness and drew attention by wearing revealing outfits that showed off [0]'s figure. [0]'s publicity stunts often revolved around [0]'s clothing either being shockingly revealing or even malfunctioning, such as when a shoulder strap of [0]'s dress snapped during a press conference. In press stories, [0] was portrayed as the embodiment of the American Dream, a girl who had risen from a miserable childhood to Hollywood stardom. Stories of [0]'s time spent in foster families and an orphanage were exaggerated and even partly fabricated. Film scholar Thomas Harris wrote that [0]'s working-class roots and lack of family made [0] appear more sexually available, \"the ideal playmate\", in contrast to her contemporary, Grace Kelly, who was also marketed as an attractive blonde, but due to her upper-class background her contemporary, Grace Kelly, who was also marketed as an attractive blonde, but due to her upper-class background's was seen as a sophisticated actress, unattainable for the majority of male viewers.Although Monroe's screen persona as a dim-witted but sexually attractive blonde was a carefully crafted act, audiences and film critics believed Monroe's screen persona as a dim-witted but sexually attractive blonde to be [0]'s real personality. believed became a hindrance when [0] wanted to pursue other kinds of roles, or to be respected as a businesswoman. The academic Sarah Churchwell studied narratives about [0] and wrote: The biggest myth is that [0] was dumb. The second is that [0] was fragile. The third is that [0] couldn't act. [0] was far from dumb, although [0] was not formally educated, and [0] was very sensitive about that. But [0] was very smart indeed\u2014and very tough. [0] had to be both to beat the Hollywood studio system in The 1940s. [...] Monroe's screen persona as a dim-witted but sexually attractive blonde was a role\u2014[0] was an actress, for heaven's sake! Such a good actress that no one now believes [0] was anything but what [0] portrayed on screen. Biographer Lois Banner writes that [0] often subtly parodied [0]'s sex symbol status in [0]'s films and public appearances, and that \"the 'Marilyn Monroe' character [0] created was a brilliant archetype, who stands between Mae West and Madonna in the tradition of twentieth-century gender tricksters.\" [0] stated that [0] was influenced by Mae West, learning \"a few tricks from Mae West\u2014that impression of laughing at, or mocking, [0]'s own sexuality\". [0] studied comedy in classes by mime and dancer Lotte Goslar, famous for her comic stage performancesmime and dancer Lotte Goslar, famous for her comic stage performances's , and mime and dancer Lotte Goslar, famous for her comic stage performances also instructed [0] on film sets. In Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, one of the films in which [0] played an archetypal dumb blonde, [0] had the sentence \"[0] can be smart when it's important, but most men don't like it\" added to [0]'s character's lines.According to film scholar Richard Dyer, [0] became \"virtually a household name for sex\" in The 1940s and \"[0]'s image has to be situated in the flux of ideas about morality and sexuality that characterised The 1940s in America\", such as Freudian ideas about sex, the Kinsey report (1953), and Betty Friedan's The Feminine Mystique (1963). By appearing vulnerable and unaware of [0]'s sex appeal, [0] was the first sex symbol to present sex as natural and without danger, in contrast to the 1940s femme fatales. Spoto likewise describes [0] as the embodiment of \"the postwar ideal of the American girl, soft, transparently needy, worshipful of men, na\u00efve, offering sex without demands\", which is echoed in Molly Haskell's's statement that \"[0] was the The 1940s fiction, the lie that a woman had no sexual needs, that a woman is there to cater to, or enhance, a man's needs.\" [0]'s contemporary Norman Mailer wrote that \"[0] suggested sex might be difficult and dangerous with others, but ice cream with [0]\", while Groucho Marx characterized [0] as \"Mae West, Theda Bara, and Bo Peep all rolled into one\". According to Molly Haskell's, due to [0]'s sex symbol status, [0] was less popular with women than with men, as women \"couldn't identify with [0] and didn't support [0]\", although this would change after [0]'s death.film scholar Richard Dyer has also argued that Monroe's blonde hair became [0]'s defining feature because Monroe's blonde hair made [0] \"racially unambiguous\" and exclusively white just as the civil rights movement was beginning, and that [0] should be seen as emblematic of racism in twentieth-century popular culture. Biographer Lois Banner agreed that it may not be a coincidence that [0] launched a trend of platinum blonde actresses during the civil rights movement, but has also criticized film scholar Richard Dyer, pointing out that in [0]'s highly publicized private life, [0] associated with people who were seen as \"white ethnics\", such as Joe DiMaggio (Italian-American) and Arthur Miller (Jewish). According to Biographer Lois Banner, [0] sometimes challenged prevailing racial norms in [0]'s publicity photographs; for example, in an image featured in Look in 1951, [0] was shown in revealing clothes while practicing with African-American singing coach Phil Moore.[0] was perceived as a specifically American star, \"a national institution as well known as hot dogs, apple pie, or baseball\" according to Photoplay. Biographer Lois Banner calls [0] the symbol of populuxe, a star whose joyful and glamorous public image \"helped America cope with America's paranoia in The 1940s about the Cold War, the atom bomb, and the totalitarian communist Soviet Union\". Historian Fiona Handyside writes that the French female audiences associated whiteness/blondness with American modernity and cleanliness, and so [0] came to symbolize a modern, \"liberated\" woman whose life takes place in the public sphere. Film historian Laura Mulvey has written of [0] as an endorsement for American consumer culture: If America was to export the democracy of glamour into post-war, impoverished Europe, the movies could be the democracy of glamour's shop window\u00a0... [0], with [0]'s all American attributes and streamlined sexuality, came to epitomise in a single image this complex interface of the economic, the political, and the erotic. By the mid 1950s, [0] stood for a brand of classless glamour, available to anyone using American cosmetics, nylons and peroxide. 20th Century-Fox further profited from [0]'s popularity by cultivating several lookalike actresses, such as Jayne Mansfield and Sheree North. Other studios also attempted to create Other studios's own Monroes: Universal Pictures with Mamie Van Doren, Columbia Pictures with Kim Novak, and The Rank Organisation with Diana Dors.In a profile, Truman Capote quoted [0]'s acting teacher, Constance Collier: \"[0] is a beautiful child. Truman Capote don't mean is in the obvious way\u2014the perhaps too obvious way. Truman Capote don't think [0]'s an actress at all, not in any traditional sense. What [0] has\u2014this presence, this luminosity, this flickering intelligence\u2014could never surface on the stage. this presence, this luminosity, this flickering intelligence's so fragile and subtle, this presence, this luminosity, this flickering intelligence can only be caught by the camera. this presence, this luminosity, this flickering intelligence's like a hummingbird in flight: only a camera can freeze the poetry of this presence, this luminosity, this flickering intelligence.\""}, "Legacy": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. According to The Guide to United States Popular Culture, \"as an icon of American popular culture, [0]'s few rivals in popularity include Elvis Presley and Mickey Mouse... no other star has ever inspired such a wide range of emotions\u2014from lust to pity, from envy to remorse.\" Art historian Gail Levin stated that [0] may have been \"the most photographed person of the 20th century\", and The American Film Institute has named [0] the sixth greatest female screen legend in American film history. The American Film Institute has included [0] on The American Film Institute's list of \"100 Most Significant Americans of All Time\", and both Variety and VH1 have placed [0] in the top ten in both Variety and VH1's rankings of the greatest popular culture icons of the 20th century.Hundreds of books have been written about [0]. [0] has been the subject of numerous films, plays, operas, and songs, and has influenced artists and entertainers such as Andy Warhol and Madonna. [0] also remains a valuable brand: [0]'s image and name have been licensed for hundreds of products, and [0] has been featured in advertising for brands such as Max Factor, Chanel, Mercedes-Benz, and Absolut Vodka.[0]'s enduring popularity is tied to [0]'s conflicted public image. On the one hand, [0] remains a sex symbol, beauty icon and one of the most famous stars of classical Hollywood cinema. On the other, [0] is also remembered for [0]'s troubled private life, unstable childhood, struggle for professional respect, as well as her death and the conspiracy theories that surrounded her death. [0] has been written about by scholars and journalists who are interested in gender and feminism; scholars and journalists who are interested in gender and feminism include Gloria Steinem, Jacqueline Rose, Molly Haskell, Sarah Churchwell, and Lois Banner. Some, such as Gloria Steinem, have viewed [0] as a victim of the studio system. Others, such as Molly Haskell, Jacqueline Rose, and Sarah Churchwell, have instead stressed [0]'s proactive role in [0]'s career and [0]'s participation in the creation of [0]'s public persona.Owing to the contrast between [0]'s stardom and troubled private life, [0] is closely linked to broader discussions about modern phenomena such as mass media, fame, and consumer culture. According to academic Susanne Hamscha, [0] has continued relevance to ongoing discussions about modern society, and [0] is \"never completely situated in one time or place\" but has become \"a surface on which narratives of American popular culture can be (re-)constructed\", and \"functions as a cultural type that can be reproduced, transformed, translated into new contexts, and enacted by other people\". Similarly, Lois Banner has called [0] the \"eternal shapeshifter\" who is re-created by \"each generation, even each individual... to each generation, even each individual's own specifications\".[0] remains a cultural icon, but critics are divided on [0]'s legacy as an actress. David Thomson called [0]'s body of work \"insubstantial\" and Pauline Kael wrote that [0] could not act, but rather \"used [0]'s lack of an actress's skills to amuse the public. [0] had the wit or crassness or desperation to turn cheesecake into acting\u2014and vice versa; [0] did what others had the 'good taste' not to do\". In contrast, Peter Bradshaw wrote that [0] was a talented comedian who \"understood how comedy achieved comedy's effects\", and Roger Ebert wrote that \"[0]'s eccentricities and neuroses on sets became notorious, but studios put up with [0] long after any other actress would have been blackballed because what studios got back on the screen was magical\". Similarly, Jonathan Rosenbaum stated that \"[0] subtly subverted the sexist content of [0]'s material\" and that \"the difficulty some people have discerning [0]'s intelligence as an actress seems rooted in the ideology of a repressive era, when super feminine women weren't supposed to be smart\"."}, "Sources": {"": ""}}
