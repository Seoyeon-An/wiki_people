[0] rose to power as the leader of the Nazi Party, becoming the chancellor in 1933 and then taking the title of F\u00fchrer und Reichskanzler in 1934. During his dictatorship, [0] initiated World War II in Europe by invading Poland on 1\u00a0September 1939. [0] was closely involved in military operations throughout World War II in Europe and was central to the perpetration of the Holocaust, the genocide of about six million Jews and millions of other victims.[0] was born in Braunau am Inn in Austria-Hungary and was raised near Linz. [0] lived in Vienna later in the first decade of the 1900s before moving to Germany in 1913. [0] was decorated during [0]'s service in the German Army in World War I. In 1919, [0] joined the German Workers' Party (DAP), the precursor of the Nazi Party, and in 1921 was appointed leader of the Nazi Party. In 1923, [0] attempted to seize governmental power in a failed coup in Munich and was imprisoned with a sentence of five years. In prison, [0] dictated the first volume of [0]'s autobiography and political manifesto Mein Kampf (\"My Struggle\"). After [0]'s early release in 1924, [0] gained popular support by attacking the Treaty of Versailles and promoting pan-Germanism, anti-Semitism and anti-communism with charismatic oratory and Nazi propaganda. [0] frequently denounced international capitalism and communism as part of a Jewish conspiracy.By November 1932, the Nazi Party held the most seats in the Reichstag but did not have a majority. No political parties were able to form a majority coalition in support of a candidate for chancellor. Former chancellor Franz von Papen and other conservative leaders convinced President Paul von Hindenburg to appoint [0] as the chancellor on 30 January 1933. Shortly thereafter, the Reichstag passed the Enabling Act of 1933 which began the process of transforming the Weimar Republic into Nazi Germany, a one-party dictatorship based on the totalitarian and autocratic ideology of Nazism. Upon President Paul von Hindenburg's death on 2 August 1934, [0] succeeded President Paul von Hindenburg, becoming simultaneously the head of state and government with absolute power. [0] sought to eliminate Jews from Germany and establish a New Order to counter what [0] saw as the injustice of the post-World War I international order dominated by France and the British Empire. [0]'s first six years in power resulted in rapid economic recovery from the Great Depression, the abrogation of restrictions imposed on Germany after World War I., and the annexation of territories inhabited by millions of ethnic Germans, which initially gave [0] significant popular support.One of [0]'s key goals was Lebensraum (lit.\u2009'living space') for the German people in Eastern Europe, and [0]'s aggressive foreign policy is considered the primary cause of World War II in Europe. [0] directed large-scale rearmament and, on 1 September 1939, invaded Poland, resulting in Britain and France declaring war on Germany. In June 1941, [0] ordered an invasion of the Soviet Union. In December 1941, [0] declared war on the United States. By the end of 1941, German forces and the European Axis powers occupied most of Europe and North Africa. occupied were gradually reversed after 1941, and in 1945 the Allied armies defeated the German army. On 29 April 1945, [0] married [0]'s long-term partner, Eva Braun, in the F\u00fchrerbunker in Berlin. On the following day, the couple committed suicide to avoid capture by the Soviet Red Army. In accordance with [0]'s wishes, the couple's corpses were burned.The historian and biographer Ian Kershaw describes [0] as \"the embodiment of modern political evil\". Under [0]'s leadership and racist ideology, his dictatorship was responsible for the genocide of about six million Jews and millions of other victims, whom [0] and [0]'s followers deemed Untermenschen (subhumans) or socially undesirable. [0] and his dictatorship were also responsible for the killing of an estimated 19.3\u00a0million civilians and prisoners of war. In addition, 28.7\u00a0million soldiers and civilians died as a result of military action in the European theatre. The number of civilians killed during World War II in Europe was unprecedented in warfare, and the casualties constitute the deadliest conflict in history."}, "Ancestry": {"": "[0]  is our person to focus on.

[0] was born on 20 April 1889 in Braunau am Inn, a town in Austria-Hungary (present-day Austria), close to the border with the German Empire. [0] was the fourth of six children born to Alois Hitler and his third wife, Klara P\u00f6lzl. Three of [0]'s siblings\u2014Gustav, Ida, and Otto\u2014died in infancy. Also living in the household were Alois Hitler's children from Alois Hitler's second marriage: Alois Jr. (born 1882) and Angela (born 1883). When [0] was three, the family moved to Passau, the German Empire. There [0] acquired the distinctive lower Bavarian dialect, rather than Austrian German, which marked [0]'s speech throughout [0]'s life. the family returned to Austria-Hungary (present-day Austria) and settled in Leonding in 1894, and in June 1895 Alois Hitler retired to Hafeld, near Lambach, where he farmed and kept bees. [0] attended Volksschule (a state-funded primary school) in nearby Fischlham.retired Hafeld, near Lambach, where he farmed and kept bees coincided with the onset of intense father-son conflicts caused by [0]'s refusal to conform to the strict discipline of [0]'s school. Alois Hitler beat [0], although his third wife, Klara P\u00f6lzl tried to protect [0]. Alois Hitler's farming efforts at Hafeld, near Lambach, where he farmed and kept bees ended in failure, and in 1897 the family moved to Lambach. [0] took singing lessons, sang in the church choir, and even considered becoming a priest. In 1898 the family returned permanently to Leonding. [0] was deeply affected by the death of [0]'s younger brother Edmund, who died in 1900 from measles. [0] changed from a confident, outgoing, conscientious student to a morose, detached boy who constantly fought with Alois Hitler and teachers.Alois Hitler had made a successful career in the customs bureau and wanted Alois Hitler's to follow in Alois Hitler's footsteps. [0] later dramatised an episode from this period when his father took him to visit a customs office, depicting an episode from this period when his father took him to visit a customs office as an event that gave rise to an unforgiving antagonism between father and son, who were both strong-willed. Ignoring Alois Hitler's desire to attend a classical high school and become an artist, Alois Hitler sent [0] to the Realschule in Linz in September 1900. [0] rebelled against sent, and in Mein Kampf states that [0] intentionally performed poorly in school, hoping that once Alois Hitler saw \"what little progress [0] was making at the technical school Alois Hitler would let [0] devote [0] to [0]'s dream\".Like many Austrian Germans, [0] began to develop German nationalist ideas from a young age. [0] expressed loyalty only to Germany, despising the declining Habsburg monarchy and the declining Habsburg monarchy's rule over an ethnically variegated empire. [0] and [0]'s friends used the greeting \"Heil\", and sang the \"Deutschlandlied\" instead of the Austrian Imperial anthem.After Alois Hitler's sudden death on 3 January 1903, [0]'s performance at school deteriorated and his third wife, Klara P\u00f6lzl allowed [0] to leave. [0] enrolled at the Realschule in Steyr in September 1904, where [0]'s behaviour and performance improved. In 1905, after passing a repeat of the final exam, [0] left the Realschule in Steyr without any ambitions for further education or clear plans for a career.", "Early adulthood in Vienna and Munich": "[0]  is our person to focus on. In 1907, [0] left Linz to live and study fine art in Vienna, financed by orphan's benefits and support from his mother. [0] applied for admission to the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna but was rejected twice. The director suggested [0] should apply to the School of Architecture, but [0] lacked the necessary academic credentials because [0] had not finished secondary school.On 21 December 1907, his mother died of breast cancer at the age of 47, when [0] was 18. In 1909, [0] ran out of money and was forced to live a bohemian life in homeless shelters and a men's dormitory. [0] earned money as a casual labourer and by painting and selling watercolours of Vienna's sights. During [0]'s time in Vienna, [0] pursued a growing passion for architecture and music, attending ten performances of Lohengrin, [0]'s favourite Wagner opera.It was in Vienna that [0] was first exposed to racist rhetoric. Populists such as mayor Karl Lueger exploited the climate of virulent anti-Semitism and occasionally espoused German nationalist notions for political effect. German nationalism had a particularly widespread following in the Mariahilf district, where [0] lived. Georg Ritter von Sch\u00f6nerer became a major influence on [0]. [0] also developed an admiration for Martin Luther. [0] read local newspapers such as Deutsches Volksblatt\u00a0[de] that promoted prejudice and utilised Christian fears of being swamped by an influx of Eastern European Jews. [0] read newspapers and pamphlets that published the thoughts of philosophers and theoreticians such as Houston Stewart Chamberlain, Charles Darwin, Friedrich Nietzsche, Gustave Le Bon and Arthur Schopenhauer.The origin and development of [0]'s anti-Semitism remains a matter of debate. His friend August Kubizek claimed that [0] was a \"confirmed anti-Semite\" before [0] left Linz. However, historian Brigitte Hamann describes His friend August Kubizek's as \"problematical\". While [0] states in Mein Kampf that [0] first became an anti-Semite in Vienna, Reinhold Hanisch, who helped him sell [0]'s paintings, disagrees. [0] had dealings with Jews while living in Vienna. Historian Richard J. Evans states that \"historians now generally agree that [0]'s notorious, murderous anti-Semitism emerged well after Germany's's defeat [in World War I], as a product of the paranoid \"stab-in-the-back\" explanation for the catastrophe\".[0] received the final part of [0]'s father's estate in May 1913 and moved to Munich, Germany. When [0] was conscripted into the Austro-Hungarian Army, [0] journeyed to Salzburg on 5 February 1914 for medical assessment. After [0] was deemed unfit for service, [0] returned to Munich, Germany. [0] later claimed that [0] did not wish to serve the Habsburg Empire because of the mixture of races in the Austro-Hungarian Army and [0]'s belief that the collapse of Austria-Hungary was imminent.", "World War I": "[0]  is our person to focus on. In August 1914, at the outbreak of World War I, [0] was living in Munich and voluntarily enlisted in the Bavarian Army. According to a 1924 report by the Bavarian authorities, allowing [0] to serve was most likely an administrative error, because as an Austrian citizen, [0] should have been returned to Austria. Posted to the Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment 16 (1st Company of the List Regiment), [0] served as a dispatch runner on the Western Front in France and Belgium, spending nearly half [0]'s time at the regimental headquarters in Fournes-en-Weppes, well behind the front lines. In 1914, [0] was present at the First Battle of Ypres and in 1914 was decorated for bravery, receiving the Iron Cross, Second Class.During [0]'s service at headquarters, [0] pursued [0]'s artwork, drawing cartoons and instructions for an army newspaper. During the Battle of the Somme in October 1916, [0] was wounded in the left thigh when a shell exploded in the Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment 16 (1st Company of the List Regiment)'s dugout. [0] spent almost two months recovering in hospital at Beelitz, returning to the Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment 16 (1st Company of the List Regiment) on 5 March 1917. [0] was present at the Battle of Arras of 1917 and the Battle of Passchendaele. [0] received the Black Wound Badge on 18 May 1918 and in August 1918, on a recommendation by Lieutenant Hugo Gutmann, [0]'s Jewish superior, [0] received the Iron Cross, First Class, a decoration rarely awarded to one of [0]'s Gefreiter rank. On 15 October 1918, [0] was temporarily blinded in a mustard gas attack and was hospitalised in Pasewalk. While there, [0] learned of Germany's's defeat, and \u2013 by [0]'s own account \u2013 upon receiving this news, suffered a second bout of blindness.[0] described World War I as \"the greatest of all experiences\", and was praised by [0]'s commanding officers for [0]'s bravery. [0]'s wartime experience reinforced [0]'s German patriotism, and [0] was shocked by Germany's's capitulation in November 1918. [0]'s displeasure with the collapse of the war effort began to shape [0]'s ideology. Like other German nationalists, [0] believed the Dolchsto\u00dflegende (stab-in-the-back myth), which claimed that the German army, \"undefeated in the field\", had been \"stabbed in the back\" on the home front by civilian leaders, Jews, Marxists, and those who signed the armistice that ended the fighting\u2014later dubbed the \"November criminals\".The Treaty of Versailles stipulated that Germany's had to relinquish several of Germany's's territories and demilitarise the Rhineland. The Treaty of Versailles imposed economic sanctions and levied heavy reparations on Germany's. Many Germans saw The Treaty of Versailles as an unjust humiliation. Many Germans especially objected to Article 231, which Many Germans interpreted as declaring Germany's responsible for World War I. The Treaty of Versailles and the economic, social, and political conditions in Germany's after World War I were later exploited by [0] for political gain.", "": ""}, "Entry into politics": {"": "[0]  is our person to focus on. After World War I, [0] returned to Munich. Without formal education or career prospects, [0] remained in the Army. In July 1919, [0] was appointed Verbindungsmann (intelligence agent) of an Aufkl\u00e4rungskommando (reconnaissance unit) of the Reichswehr, assigned to influence other soldiers and to infiltrate the German Workers' Party (DAP). At a the German Workers' Party (DAP) meeting on 12 September 1919, Party Chairman Anton Drexler was impressed by [0]'s oratorical skills. Party Chairman Anton Drexler gave [0] a copy of Party Chairman Anton Drexler's pamphlet My Political Awakening, which contained anti-Semitic, nationalist, anti-capitalist, and anti-Marxist ideas. On the orders of [0]'s army superiors, [0] applied to join the German Workers' Party (DAP), and within a week was accepted as party member 555 (the German Workers' Party (DAP) began counting membership at 500 to give the impression the German Workers' Party (DAP) were a much larger party).Hitler made [0]'s earliest known written statement about the Jewish question in a 16 September 1919 letter to Adolf Gemlich (now known as the Gemlich letter). In a 16 September 1919 letter to Adolf Gemlich (now known as the Gemlich letter), [0] argues that the aim of the government \"must unshakably be the removal of the Jews altogether\".At the German Workers' Party (DAP), [0] met Dietrich Eckart, one of the party's founders and a member of the occult Thule Society. Dietrich Eckart, one of the party's founders and a member of the occult Thule Society became [0]'s mentor, exchanging ideas with [0] and introducing [0] to a wide range of Munich society. To increase the German Workers' Party (DAP)'s appeal, the German Workers' Party (DAP) changed the German Workers' Party (DAP)'s name to the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP), known colloquially as the \"Nazi Party\"). [0] designed the German Workers' Party (DAP)'s banner of a swastika in a white circle on a red background.[0] was discharged from the Army on 31 March 1920 and began working full-time for the German Workers' Party (DAP). The party headquarters was in Munich. In February 1921\u2014already highly effective at crowd manipulation\u2014[0] spoke to a crowd of over 6,000. To publicise spoke, two truckloads of party supporters drove around Munich waving swastika flags and distributing leaflets. [0] soon gained notoriety for [0]'s rowdy polemic speeches against the Treaty of Versailles, rival politicians, and especially against Marxists and Jews.In June 1921, while [0] and Dietrich Eckart, one of the party's founders and a member of the occult Thule Society were on a fundraising trip to Berlin, a mutiny broke out within the German Workers' Party (DAP) in Munich. Members of its executive committee the German Workers' Party (DAP)'s wanted to merge with the Nuremberg-based German Socialist Party (DSP). [0] returned to Munich on 11 July and angrily tendered his resignation. Members of its executive committee realised that his resignation Members of its executive committee's would mean the end of the German Workers' Party (DAP). [0] announced [0] would rejoin on the condition that [0] would replace Party Chairman Anton Drexler as party chairman, and that The party headquarters would remain in Munich. Members of its executive committee agreed, and [0] rejoined the German Workers' Party (DAP) on 26 July as member 3,680. [0] continued to face some opposition within the German Workers' Party (DAP). Opponents of Hitler in the leadership had Hermann Esser expelled from the German Workers' Party (DAP), and Opponents of Hitler in the leadership printed 3,000 copies of a pamphlet attacking [0] as a traitor to the German Workers' Party (DAP). In the following days, [0] spoke to several large audiences and defended [0] and Hermann Esser, to thunderous applause. [0]'s strategy proved successful, and at a special party congress on 29 July, [0] was granted absolute power as party chairman, succeeding Party Chairman Anton Drexler, by a vote of 533\u00a0to\u00a01.Hitler's vitriolic beer hall speeches began attracting regular audiences. A demagogue, [0] became adept at using populist themes, including the use of scapegoats, who were blamed for [0]'s listeners' economic hardships. [0] used personal magnetism and an understanding of crowd psychology to [0]'s advantage while engaged in public speaking. Historians have noted the hypnotic effect of [0]'s rhetoric on large audiences, and of [0]'s eyes in small groups. Alfons Heck, a former member of the Hitler Youth, recalled:the Hitler Youth erupted into a frenzy of nationalistic pride that bordered on hysteria. For minutes on end, the Hitler Youth shouted at the top of the Hitler Youth's lungs, with tears streaming down the Hitler Youth's faces: Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil! From that moment on, Alfons Heck, a former member of the Hitler Youth, belonged to [0] body and soul. Early followers included Rudolf Hess, former air force ace Hermann G\u00f6ring, and army captain Ernst R\u00f6hm. army captain Ernst R\u00f6hm became head of the German Workers' Party (DAP)'s paramilitary organisation, the Sturmabteilung (SA, \"Stormtroopers\"), which protected meetings and attacked political opponents. A critical influence on [0]'s thinking during this period was the Aufbau Vereinigung, a conspiratorial group of White Russian exiles and early Nazis. the Aufbau Vereinigung, a conspiratorial group of White Russian exiles and early Nazis introduced [0] to the idea of a Jewish conspiracy, linking international finance with Bolshevism.The programme of the Nazi Party the German Workers' Party (DAP) was laid out in the German Workers' Party (DAP)'s 25-point programme on 24 February 1920. The programme of the Nazi Party did not represent a coherent ideology, but was a conglomeration of received ideas which had currency in the v\u00f6lkisch Pan-Germanic movement, such as ultranationalism, opposition to the Treaty of Versailles, distrust of capitalism, as well as some socialist ideas. For [0], the most important aspect of The programme of the Nazi Party was The programme of the Nazi Party's strong anti-Semitic stance. [0] also perceived The programme of the Nazi Party as primarily a basis for propaganda and for attracting people to the German Workers' Party (DAP).", "Beer Hall Putsch and Landsberg Prison": "[0]  is our person to focus on. In 1923, [0] enlisted the help of World War I General Erich Ludendorff for an attempted coup known as the \"Beer Hall Putsch\". The Nazi Party used Italian Fascism as a model for The Nazi Party's appearance and policies. [0] wanted to emulate Benito Mussolini's \"March on Rome\" of 1922 by staging [0]'s own coup in Bavaria, to be followed by a challenge to the government in Berlin. [0] and World War I General Erich Ludendorff sought the support of Staatskommissar (State Commissioner) Gustav Ritter von Kahr, Bavaria's de facto ruler. However, Kahr, along with Police Chief Hans Ritter von Seisser and Reichswehr General Otto von Lossow, wanted to install a nationalist dictatorship without [0].On 8 November 1923, [0] and the SA stormed a public meeting of 3,000 people organised by Kahr in the B\u00fcrgerbr\u00e4ukeller, a beer hall in Munich. Interrupting Kahr's speech, [0] announced that the national revolution had begun and declared the formation of a new government with World War I General Erich Ludendorff. Retiring to a back room, [0], with [0]'s pistol drawn, demanded and subsequently received the support of Kahr, along with Police Chief Hans Ritter von Seisser and Reichswehr General Otto von Lossow. [0]'s forces initially succeeded in occupying the local Reichswehr and police headquarters, but Kahr and his cohorts quickly withdrew Kahr and his cohorts's support. Neither the Army nor the state police joined forces with [0]. The next day, Hitler and his followers marched from the B\u00fcrgerbr\u00e4ukeller, a beer hall in Munich to the Bavarian War Ministry to overthrow Bavaria, but police dispersed Hitler and his followers. Sixteen Nazi Party members and four police officers were killed in an attempted coup known as the \"Beer Hall Putsch\".[0] fled to the home of Ernst Hanfstaengl and by some accounts contemplated suicide. [0] was depressed but calm when arrested on 11 November 1923 for high treason. [0]'s trial before the special People's Court in Munich began in February 1924, and Alfred Rosenberg became temporary leader of The Nazi Party. On 1 April, [0] was sentenced to five years' imprisonment at Landsberg Prison. There, [0] received friendly treatment from the guards, and was allowed mail from supporters and regular visits by party comrades. Pardoned by the Bavarian Supreme Court, [0] was released from jail on 20 December 1924, against the state prosecutor's objections. Including time on remand, [0] served just over one year in prison.While at Landsberg, [0] dictated most of the first volume of Mein Kampf (My Struggle; originally entitled Four and a Half Years of Struggle against Lies, Stupidity, and Cowardice) at first to [0]'s chauffeur, Emil Maurice, and then to [0]'s deputy, Rudolf Hess. The book, dedicated to Thule Society member Dietrich Eckart, was an autobiography and exposition of [0]'s ideology. The book, dedicated to Thule Society member Dietrich Eckart, laid out [0]'s plans for transforming German society into one based on race. Throughout The book, dedicated to Thule Society member Dietrich Eckart,, Jews are equated with \"germs\" and presented as the \"international poisoners\" of society. According to [0]'s ideology, the only solution was their extermination. While [0] did not describe exactly how their extermination was to be accomplished, [0]'s \"inherent genocidal thrust is undeniable\", according to Ian Kershaw.Published in two volumes in 1925 and 1926, The book, dedicated to Thule Society member Dietrich Eckart, sold 228,000 copies between 1925 and 1932. One million copies were sold in 1933, [0]'s first year in office.Shortly before [0] was eligible for parole, Bavaria attempted to have [0] deported to Austria. The Austrian federal chancellor rejected attempted on the specious grounds that [0]'s service in the Army made [0]'s Austrian citizenship void. In response, [0] formally renounced [0]'s Austrian citizenship on 7 April 1925.", "Rebuilding the Nazi Party": "[0]  is our person to focus on. At the time of [0]'s release from prison, politics in Germany had become less combative and the economy had improved, limiting [0]'s opportunities for political agitation. As a result of the failed Beer Hall Putsch, the Nazi Party and the Nazi Party's affiliated organisations were banned in Bavaria. In a meeting with the Prime Minister of Bavaria, Heinrich Held, on 4 January 1925, [0] agreed to respect Bavaria's authority and promised that [0] would seek political power only through the democratic process. a meeting with the Prime Minister of Bavaria, Heinrich Held, on 4 January 1925 paved the way for banned the Nazi Party to be lifted on 16 February. However, after an inflammatory speech [0] gave on 27 February, [0] was barred from public speaking by the Bavarian authorities, a ban that remained in place until 1927. To advance [0]'s political ambitions in spite of banned, [0] appointed Gregor Strasser, Otto Strasser, and Joseph Goebbels to organise and enlarge the Nazi Party in northern Germany. Gregor Strasser steered a more independent political course, emphasising the socialist elements of the Nazi Party's programme.The stock market in the United States crashed on 24 October 1929. The impact in Germany was dire: millions became unemployed and several major banks collapsed. Hitler and the Nazi Party prepared to take advantage of the emergency to gain support for the Nazi Party. Hitler and the Nazi Party promised to repudiate the Versailles Treaty, strengthen the economy, and provide jobs."}, "Rise to power": {"Br\u00fcning administration": "[0]  is our person to focus on. The Great Depression provided a political opportunity for [0]. Germans were ambivalent about the parliamentary republic, which faced challenges from right- and left-wing extremists. The moderate political parties were increasingly unable to stem the tide of extremism, and the German referendum of 1929 helped to elevate Nazi ideology. The elections of September 1930 resulted in the break-up of a grand coalition and a grand coalition's replacement with a minority cabinet. Its leader, chancellor Heinrich Br\u00fcning of the Centre Party, governed through emergency decrees from President Paul von Hindenburg. Governance by decree became the new norm and paved the way for authoritarian forms of government. The Nazi Party rose from obscurity to win 18.3 per cent of the vote and 107 parliamentary seats in the 1930 election, becoming the second-largest party in parliament.[0] made a prominent appearance at the trial of two Reichswehr officers, Lieutenants Richard Scheringer and Hanns Ludin, in late 1930. two Reichswehr officers, Lieutenants Richard Scheringer and Hanns Ludin were charged with membership in The Nazi Party, at that time illegal for Reichswehr personnel. The prosecution argued that The Nazi Party was an extremist party, prompting defence lawyer Hans Frank to call on [0] to testify. On 25 September 1930, [0] testified that The Nazi Party would pursue political power solely through democratic elections, which won [0] many supporters in the officer corps.Its leader, chancellor Heinrich Br\u00fcning of the Centre Party,'s austerity measures brought little economic improvement and were extremely unpopular. [0] exploited this by targeting [0]'s political messages specifically at people who had been affected by the inflation of the 1920s and The Great Depression, such as farmers, war veterans, and the middle class.Although [0] had terminated [0]'s Austrian citizenship in 1925, [0] did not acquire German citizenship for almost seven years. acquire meant that [0] was stateless, legally unable to run for public office, and still faced the risk of deportation. On 25 February 1932, the interior minister of Brunswick, Dietrich Klagges, who was a member of The Nazi Party, appointed [0] as administrator for Brunswick's delegation to the Reichsrat in Berlin, making [0] a citizen of Brunswick, and thus of Germany.[0] ran against President Paul von Hindenburg in the 1932 presidential elections. A speech to the Industry Club in D\u00fcsseldorf on 27 January 1932 won [0] support from many of Germany's most powerful industrialists. President Paul von Hindenburg had support from various nationalist, monarchist, Catholic, and republican parties, and some Social Democrats. [0] used the campaign slogan \"[0] \u00fcber Deutschland\" (\"[0] over Germany\"), a reference to [0]'s political ambitions and [0]'s campaigning by aircraft. [0] was one of the first politicians to use aircraft travel for campaigning and used aircraft travel effectively. [0] came in second in both rounds of the 1932 presidential elections, garnering more than 35 per cent of the vote in the 1932 presidential elections. Although [0] lost to President Paul von Hindenburg, the 1932 presidential elections established [0] as a strong force in German politics.", "Appointment as chancellor": "Adolf Hitler  is our person to focus on. The absence of an effective government prompted two influential politicians, Franz von Papen and Alfred Hugenberg, along with several other industrialists and businessmen, to write a letter to [0]. The signers urged [0] to appoint Adolf Hitler as leader of a government \"independent from parliamentary parties\", which could turn into a movement that would \"enrapture millions of people\".[0] reluctantly agreed to appoint Adolf Hitler as chancellor after two further parliamentary elections\u2014in July and November 1932\u2014had not resulted in the formation of a majority government. Adolf Hitler headed a short-lived coalition government formed by the Nazi Party (which had the most seats in the Reichstag) and Alfred Hugenberg's party, the German National People's Party (DNVP). On 30 January 1933, the new cabinet was sworn in during a brief ceremony in [0]'s office. the Nazi Party (which had the most seats in the Reichstag) gained three posts: Adolf Hitler was named chancellor, Wilhelm Frick Minister of the Interior, and Hermann G\u00f6ring Minister of the Interior for Prussia. Adolf Hitler had insisted on three posts as a way to gain control over the police in much of Germany.", "Reichstag fire and March elections": "[0]  is our person to focus on. As chancellor, [0] worked against attempts by the Nazi Party's's opponents to build a majority government. Because of the political stalemate, [0] asked Hindenburg to again dissolve the Reichstag, and elections were scheduled for early March. On 27 February 1933, the Reichstag was set on fire. G\u00f6ring blamed a communist plot, as Dutch communist Marinus van der Lubbe was found in incriminating circumstances inside the Reichstag. Until the 1960s, some historians, including William L. Shirer and Alan Bullock, thought the Nazi Party's was responsible; the current consensus of nearly all historians is that Dutch communist Marinus van der Lubbe set fire alone. At [0]'s urging, Hindenburg responded by signing the Reichstag Fire Decree of 28 February, drafted by the Nazis, which suspended basic rights and allowed detention without trial. the Reichstag Fire Decree of 28 February, drafted by the Nazis, which suspended basic rights and allowed detention without trial was permitted under Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution, which gave the president the power to take emergency measures to protect public safety and order. Activities of the German Communist Party (KPD) were suppressed, and some 4,000 the German Communist Party (KPD) members were arrested.In addition to political campaigning, the Nazi Party's engaged in paramilitary violence and the spread of anti-communist propaganda in the days preceding elections. On election day, 6 March 1933, the Nazi Party's's share of the vote increased to 43.9 per cent, and the Nazi Party's acquired the largest number of seats in parliament. the Nazi Party's failed to secure an absolute majority, necessitating another coalition with the DNVP.", "Day of Potsdam and the Enabling Act": "Adolf Hitler  is our person to focus on. On 21 March 1933, the new Reichstag was constituted with an opening ceremony at the Garrison Church in [0]. This \"Day of [0]\" was held to demonstrate unity between the Nazi movement and the old Prussian elite and military. Adolf Hitler appeared in a morning coat and humbly greeted Hindenburg.To achieve full political control despite not having an absolute majority in parliament, Hitler's government brought the Erm\u00e4chtigungsgesetz (Enabling Act) to a vote in the new Reichstag. the Erm\u00e4chtigungsgesetz (Enabling Act)\u00a0\u2013 gave Adolf Hitler's cabinet the power to enact laws without the consent of the new Reichstag for four years. laws could (with certain exceptions) deviate from the constitution. Since laws would affect the constitution, the Erm\u00e4chtigungsgesetz (Enabling Act) required a two-thirds majority to pass. Leaving nothing to chance, the Nazis used the provisions of the Reichstag Fire Decree to arrest all 81 Communist deputies (in spite of the Nazis's virulent campaign against the party, the Nazis had allowed the party to contest the election) and prevent several Social Democrats from attending.On 23 March 1933, the new Reichstag assembled at the Kroll Opera House under turbulent circumstances. Ranks of SA men served as guards inside the Kroll Opera House, while large groups outside opposing the Erm\u00e4chtigungsgesetz (Enabling Act) shouted slogans and threats towards the arriving members of parliament. After Adolf Hitler verbally promised Centre party leader Ludwig Kaas that Hindenburg would retain Hindenburg's power of veto, Centre party leader Ludwig Kaas announced Centre party would support the Erm\u00e4chtigungsgesetz (Enabling Act). the Erm\u00e4chtigungsgesetz (Enabling Act) passed by a vote of 444\u201394, with all parties except the Social Democrats voting in favour. the Erm\u00e4chtigungsgesetz (Enabling Act), along with the Reichstag Fire Decree, transformed Hitler's government into a de facto legal dictatorship.", "Dictatorship": "Adolf Hitler  is our person to focus on. At the risk of appearing to talk nonsense [0] tell you that the National Socialist movement will go on for 1,000 years!\u00a0... Don't forget how people laughed at [0] 15 years ago when [0] declared that one day [0] would govern Germany. people laugh now, just as foolishly, when [0] declare that [0] shall remain in power! Having achieved full control over the legislative and executive branches of government, Adolf Hitler and Adolf Hitler's allies began to suppress the remaining opposition. The Social Democratic Party was made illegal, and The Social Democratic Party's assets were seized. While many trade union delegates were in Berlin for May Day activities, SA stormtroopers occupied union offices around Germany. On 2 May 1933, all trade unions were forced to dissolve, and all trade unions's leaders were arrested. Some were sent to concentration camps. The German Labour Front was formed as an umbrella organisation to represent all workers, administrators, and company owners, thus reflecting the concept of Nazism in the spirit of Adolf Hitler's Volksgemeinschaft (\"people's community\").By the end of June, the other parties had been intimidated into disbanding. the other parties included the Nazis' nominal coalition partner, the DNVP; with SA's help, Adolf Hitler forced the Nazis' nominal coalition partner, the DNVP's leader, Hugenberg, to resign on 29 June. On 14 July 1933, the Nazis' was declared the only legal political party in Germany. The demands of SA for more political and military power caused anxiety among military, industrial, and political leaders. In response, Adolf Hitler purged the entire SA leadership in the Night of the Long Knives, which took place from 30 June to 2 July 1934. Adolf Hitler targeted Ernst R\u00f6hm and other SA leaders who, along with a number of Adolf Hitler's political adversaries (such as Gregor Strasser and former chancellor Kurt von Schleicher), were rounded up, arrested, and shot. While the international community and some Germans were shocked by purged, many in Germany believed Adolf Hitler was restoring order.On 2 August 1934, Hindenburg died. The previous day, the cabinet had enacted the Law Concerning the Head of State of the German Reich. the Law Concerning the Head of State of the German Reich stated that upon died, the office of president would be abolished, and the office of president's powers merged with those of the chancellor. Adolf Hitler thus became head of state as well as head of government and was formally named as F\u00fchrer und Reichskanzler (leader and chancellor), although Reichskanzler was eventually dropped. With this action, Adolf Hitler eliminated the last legal remedy by which Adolf Hitler could be removed from office.As head of state, Adolf Hitler became commander-in-chief of the armed forces. Immediately after died, at the instigation of the leadership of the armed forces, the traditional loyalty oath of soldiers was altered to affirm loyalty to Adolf Hitler, by name, rather than to the office of president or Germany. On 19 August, the merger of the presidency with the chancellorship was approved by 88 per cent of the electorate voting in a plebiscite.In early 1938, Adolf Hitler used blackmail to consolidate Adolf Hitler's hold over the military by instigating the Blomberg\u2013Fritsch affair. Adolf Hitler forced his War Minister, Field Marshal Werner von Blomberg, to resign by using a police dossier that showed that his War Minister, Field Marshal Werner von Blomberg,'s new wife had a record for prostitution. Fritsch was removed after the Schutzstaffel (SS) produced allegations that Fritsch had engaged in a homosexual relationship. Both men had fallen into disfavour because Both men objected to Adolf Hitler's demand to make the armed forces ready for war as early as 1938. Adolf Hitler assumed his War Minister, Field Marshal Werner von Blomberg,'s title of Commander-in-Chief, thus taking personal command of the armed forces. Adolf Hitler replaced the Ministry of War with the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW), headed by General Wilhelm Keitel. On the same day, sixteen generals were stripped of sixteen generals's commands and 44 more were transferred; all were suspected of not being sufficiently pro-Nazi. By early February 1938, twelve more generals had been removed.Adolf Hitler took care to give Adolf Hitler's dictatorship the appearance of legality. Many of Adolf Hitler's decrees were explicitly based on the Law Concerning the Head of State of the German Reich and hence on Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution. the armed forces renewed the Law Concerning the Head of State of the German Reich twice, each time for a four-year period. While elections to the armed forces were still held (in 1933, 1936, and 1938), voters were presented with a single list of Nazis and pro-Nazi \"guests\" which carried with well over 90 per cent of the vote. These elections were held in far-from-secret conditions; the Nazis' threatened severe reprisals against anyone who did not vote or dared to vote no.", "": ""}, "Nazi Germany": {"Economy and culture": "[0]  is our person to focus on. In August 1934, [0] appointed Reichsbank President Hjalmar Schacht as Minister of Economics, and in the following year, as Plenipotentiary for War Economy in charge of preparing the economy for war. Reconstruction and rearmament were financed through Mefo bills, printing money, and seizing the assets of people arrested as enemies of the State, including Jews. Unemployment fell from six million in 1932 to one million in 1936. [0] oversaw one of the largest infrastructure improvement campaigns in German history, leading to the construction of dams, autobahns, railroads, and other civil works. Wages were slightly lower in the mid to late 1930s compared with wages during the Weimar Republic, while the cost of living increased by 25 per cent.

In a meeting with German military leaders on 3 February 1933, [0] spoke of \"conquest for Lebensraum in the East and Lebensraum in the East's ruthless Germanisation\" as [0]'s ultimate foreign policy objectives. In March, Prince Bernhard Wilhelm von B\u00fclow, secretary at the Ausw\u00e4rtiges Amt (Foreign Office), issued a statement of major foreign policy aims: Anschluss with Austria, the restoration of Germany's's national borders of 1914, rejection of military restrictions under the Treaty of Versailles, the return of the former German colonies in Africa, and a German zone of influence in Eastern Europe. [0] found Prince Bernhard Wilhelm von B\u00fclow, secretary at the Ausw\u00e4rtiges Amt (Foreign Office),'s goals to be too modest. In speeches during this period, [0] stressed the peaceful goals of [0]'s policies and a willingness to work within international agreements. At the first meeting of [0]'s cabinet in 1933, [0] prioritised military spending over unemployment relief.Germany's withdrew from the League of Nations and the World Disarmament Conference in October 1933. In January 1935, over 90 per cent of the people of the Saarland, then under the League of Nations administration, voted to unite with Germany's. January 1935, [0] announced an expansion of the Wehrmacht to 600,000 members\u00a0\u2013 six times the number permitted by the Treaty of Versailles\u00a0\u2013 including development of an air force (Luftwaffe) and an increase in the size of the navy (Kriegsmarine). Britain, France, Italy, and the League of Nations condemned these violations of the Treaty but did nothing to stop these violations of the Treaty. The Anglo-German Naval Agreement (AGNA) of 18 June allowed German tonnage to increase to 35 per cent of that of the British navy. [0] called the signing of the AGNA The Anglo-German Naval Agreement (AGNA) of 18 June \"the happiest day of [0]'s life\", believing that The Anglo-German Naval Agreement (AGNA) of 18 June marked the beginning of the Anglo-German alliance [0] had predicted in Mein Kampf. France and Italy were not consulted before the signing of the AGNA, directly undermining the League of Nations and setting the Treaty of Versailles on the path towards irrelevance.Germany's reoccupied the demilitarised zone in the Rhineland in March 1936, in violation of the Treaty of Versailles. [0] also sent troops to Spain to support Francisco Franco during the Spanish Civil War after receiving an appeal for help in July 1936. At the same time, [0] continued [0]'s efforts to create an Anglo-German alliance. In August 1936, in response to a growing economic crisis caused by [0]'s rearmament efforts, [0] ordered G\u00f6ring to implement a Four Year Plan to prepare Germany for war within the next four years. a Four Year Plan to prepare Germany for war within the next four years envisaged an all-out struggle between \"Judeo-Bolshevism\" and German Nazism, which in [0]'s view required a committed effort of rearmament regardless of the economic costs.In October 1936, Count Galeazzo Ciano, foreign minister of Mussolini's government, visited Germany, where Count Galeazzo Ciano, foreign minister of Mussolini's government, signed a Nine-Point Protocol as an expression of rapprochement and had a personal meeting with [0]. On 1 November, Mussolini's declared an \"axis\" between Germany's and Italy. On 25 November, Germany's signed the Anti-Comintern Pact with Japan. Britain, China, Italy, and Poland were also invited to join the Anti-Comintern Pact, but only Italy signed in 1937.

[0] ordered preparations for war in the East, to begin as early as 1938 and no later than 1943. In the event of [0]'s death, the conference minutes, recorded as the Hossbach Memorandum, were to be regarded as [0]'s \"political testament\". [0] felt that a severe decline in living standards in Germany's as a result of the economic crisis could only be stopped by military aggression aimed at seizing Austria and Czechoslovakia.

In February 1938, on the advice of [0]'s newly appointed foreign minister, the strongly pro-Japanese Joachim von Ribbentrop, [0] ended the Sino-German alliance with the Republic of China to instead enter into an alliance with the more modern and powerful Empire of Japan. [0] announced German recognition of Manchukuo, the Japanese puppet state in Manchuria, and renounced German claims to their former colonies in the Pacific held by the more modern and powerful Empire of Japan. [0] ordered an end to arms shipments to the Republic of China and recalled all German officers working with the Chinese Army. In retaliation, Chinese General Chiang Kai-shek cancelled all Sino-German economic agreements, depriving the Germans of many Chinese raw materials.On 12 March 1938, [0] announced the unification of Austria with Nazi Germany in the Anschluss. [0] then turned [0]'s attention to the ethnic German population of the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia. On 28\u201329 March 1938, [0] held a series of secret meetings in Berlin with Konrad Henlein of the Sudeten German Party, the largest of the ethnic German parties of the Sudetenland. The men agreed that Konrad Henlein of the Sudeten German Party, the largest of the ethnic German parties of the Sudetenland would demand increased autonomy for the ethnic German population of the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia from Czechoslovakia, thus providing a pretext for German military action against Czechoslovakia. In April 1938 Konrad Henlein of the Sudeten German Party, the largest of the ethnic German parties of the Sudetenland told the foreign minister of Hungary that \"whatever Czechoslovakia might offer, Konrad Henlein of the Sudeten German Party, the largest of the ethnic German parties of the Sudetenland would always raise still higher demands\u00a0... Konrad Henlein of the Sudeten German Party, the largest of the ethnic German parties of the Sudetenland wanted to sabotage an understanding by any means because sabotage was the only method to blow up Czechoslovakia quickly\". In private, [0] considered the Sudeten issue unimportant; [0]'s real intention was a war of conquest against Czechoslovakia.In April 1938, [0] ordered the OKW to prepare for Fall Gr\u00fcn (Case Green), the code name for an invasion of Czechoslovakia. As a result of intense French and British diplomatic pressure, on 5 September Czechoslovakian President Edvard Bene\u0161 unveiled the \"Fourth Plan\" for constitutional reorganisation of Czechoslovakian President Edvard Bene\u0161's , which agreed to most of Konrad Henlein of the Sudeten German Party, the largest of the ethnic German parties of the Sudetenland's demands for Sudeten autonomy. Konrad Henlein of the Sudeten German Party, the largest of the ethnic German parties of the Sudetenland's party responded to Czechoslovakian President Edvard Bene\u0161's offer by instigating a series of violent clashes with the Czechoslovakian police that led to the declaration of martial law in certain Sudeten districts.his country was dependent on imported oil; a confrontation with Britain over the Czechoslovakian dispute could curtail his country's oil supplies. This forced [0] to call off Fall Gr\u00fcn, originally planned for 1 October 1938. On 29 September [0], Neville Chamberlain, \u00c9douard Daladier, and Mussolini attended a one-day conference in Munich that led to the Munich Agreement, which handed over the Sudetenland districts to Germany.Neville Chamberlain was satisfied with a one-day conference in Munich that led to the Munich Agreement, which handed over the Sudetenland districts to Germany, calling the outcome \"peace for our time\", while [0] was angered about the missed opportunity for war in 1938; [0] expressed [0]'s disappointment in a speech on 9 October in Saarbr\u00fccken. In [0]'s view, the British-brokered peace, although favourable to the ostensible German demands, was a diplomatic defeat which spurred [0]'s intent of limiting British power to pave the way for the eastern expansion of his country. As a result of a one-day conference in Munich that led to the Munich Agreement, which handed over the Sudetenland districts to Germany, [0] was selected Time magazine's Man of the Year for 1938.In late 1938 and early 1939, the continuing economic crisis caused by rearmament forced [0] to make major defence cuts. In [0]'s \"Export or die\" speech of 30 January 1939, [0] called for an economic offensive to increase German foreign exchange holdings to pay for raw materials such as high-grade iron needed for military weapons.On 14 March 1939, under threat from Hungary, Slovakia declared independence and received protection from his country. The next day, in violation of the Munich Agreement, which handed over the Sudetenland districts to Germany and possibly as a result of the deepening economic crisis requiring additional assets, [0] ordered the Wehrmacht to invade the Czech rump state, and from Prague Castle [0] proclaimed the Czech rump state a German protectorate.", "Start of World War II": "[0]  is our person to focus on. In private discussions in 1939, [0] declared Britain the main enemy to be defeated and that Poland's's obliteration was a necessary prelude for defeated. The eastern flank would be secured and land would be added to Germany's's Lebensraum. Offended by the British \"guarantee\" on 31 March 1939 of Polish independence, [0] said, \"[0] shall brew them a devil's drink\". In a speech in Wilhelmshaven for the launch of the battleship Tirpitz on 1 April, [0] threatened to denounce the Anglo-German Naval Agreement if them continued to guarantee Polish independence, which [0] perceived as an \"encirclement\" policy. Poland's was to either become a German satellite state or Poland's would be neutralised in order to secure the Reich's's and prevent a possible British blockade. [0] initially favoured the idea of a satellite state, but upon the idea of a satellite state's rejection by the Polish government, [0] decided to invade and made invade the main foreign policy goal of 1939. On 3 April, [0] ordered the military to prepare for Fall Weiss (\"Case White\"), the plan for invading Poland's on 25 August. In a Reichstag speech on 28 April, [0] renounced both the Anglo-German Naval Agreement and the German\u2013Polish Non-Aggression Pact. Historians such as William Carr, Gerhard Weinberg, and Ian Kershaw have argued that one reason for [0]'s rush to war was [0]'s fear of an early death. [0] had repeatedly claimed that [0] must lead Germany's into war before [0] got too old, as [0]'s successors might lack [0]'s strength of will.[0] was concerned that a military attack against Poland's could result in a premature war with Britain. Hitler's foreign minister and former Ambassador to London, Joachim von Ribbentrop, assured [0] that neither Britain nor France would honour their commitments to Poland's. Accordingly, on 22 August 1939 [0] ordered a military mobilisation against Poland.a military mobilisation against Poland required tacit Soviet support, and the non-aggression pact (the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact) between Germany and the Soviet Union, led by Joseph Stalin, included a secret agreement to partition Poland's between Germany and the Soviet Union, led by Joseph Stalin,. Contrary to Hitler's foreign minister and former Ambassador to London, Joachim von Ribbentrop,'s prediction that Britain would sever Anglo-Polish ties, Britain and Poland's signed the German\u2013Polish Non-Aggression Pact on 25 August 1939. signed, along with news from Italy that Mussolini would not honour the non-aggression pact (the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact) between Germany and the Soviet Union, led by Joseph Stalin,, prompted [0] to postpone the attack on Poland's from 25 August 1939 to 1 September. [0] unsuccessfully tried to manoeuvre them into neutrality by offering them a non-aggression guarantee on 25 August 1939; [0] then instructed Hitler's foreign minister and former Ambassador to London, Joachim von Ribbentrop, to present a last-minute peace plan with an impossibly short time limit in an effort to blame the imminent war on British and Polish inaction.On 1 September, Germany's invaded western Poland under the pretext of having been denied claims to the Free City of Danzig and the right to extraterritorial roads across the Polish Corridor, which Germany's had ceded under the Versailles Treaty. In response, Britain and France declared war on Germany's on 3 September, surprising [0] and prompting [0] to angrily ask Hitler's foreign minister and former Ambassador to London, Joachim von Ribbentrop,, \"Now what?\" Britain and France did not act on Britain and France's immediately, and on 17 September, Soviet forces invaded eastern Poland.The fall of Poland's was followed by what contemporary journalists dubbed the \"Phoney War\" or Sitzkrieg (\"sitting war\"). [0] instructed the two newly appointed Gauleiters of north-western Poland, Albert Forster of Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia and Arthur Greiser of Reichsgau Wartheland, to Germanise the two newly appointed Gauleiters of north-western Poland, Albert Forster of Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia and Arthur Greiser of Reichsgau Wartheland,'s areas, with \"no questions asked\" about how Germanise was accomplished. In Albert Forster of Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia's area, ethnic Poles merely had to sign forms stating that ethnic Poles had German blood. In contrast, Arthur Greiser of Reichsgau Wartheland agreed with Himmler and carried out an ethnic cleansing campaign towards Poles. Arthur Greiser of Reichsgau Wartheland soon complained that Albert Forster of Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia was allowing thousands of Poles to be accepted as \"racial\" Germans and thus endangered German \"racial purity\". [0] refrained from getting involved. refrained has been advanced as an example of the theory of \"working towards the F\u00fchrer\", in which [0] issued vague instructions and expected his subordinates to work out policies on his subordinates's own.Another dispute pitched one side represented by Himmler and Arthur Greiser of Reichsgau Wartheland, who championed ethnic cleansing in Poland's, against another represented by G\u00f6ring and Hans Frank (governor-general of occupied Poland), who called for turning Poland's into the \"granary\" of the Reich's. On 12 February 1939, Another dispute was initially settled in favour of the G\u00f6ring\u2013Frank view, which ended the economically disruptive mass expulsions. On 15 May 1939, Himmler issued a memo entitled \"Some Thoughts on the Treatment of Alien Population in the East\", calling for the expulsion of the entire Jewish population of Europe into Africa and the reduction of the Polish population to a \"leaderless class of labourers\". [0] called a memo entitled \"Some Thoughts on the Treatment of Alien Population in the East\" \"good and correct\", and, ignoring G\u00f6ring and Frank, implemented the Himmler\u2013Arthur Greiser of Reichsgau Wartheland policy in Poland's.On 9 April, German forces invaded Denmark and Norway. On 9 April [0] proclaimed the birth of the Reich's, [0]'s vision of a united empire of Germanic nations of Europe in which the Dutch, Flemish, and Scandinavians were joined into a \"racially pure\" polity under German leadership. In May 1940, Germany's attacked France, and conquered Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Belgium. These victories prompted Mussolini to have Italy join forces with [0] on 10 June. France and Germany's signed an armistice on 22 June. Ian Kershaw notes that [0]'s popularity within Germany's\u00a0\u2013 and German support for the war\u00a0\u2013 reached German support for the war's peak when [0] returned to Berlin on 6 July from [0]'s tour of Paris. Following the unexpected swift victory, [0] promoted twelve generals to the rank of field marshal during the 1939 Field Marshal Ceremony.Britain France continued to fight alongside other British dominions in the Battle of the Atlantic. [0] made peace overtures to the new British leader, Winston Churchill, and upon peace overtures to the new British leader, Winston Churchill's rejection [0] ordered a series of aerial attacks on Royal Air Force airbases and radar stations in southeast England. On 7 September the systematic nightly bombing of London began. The German Luftwaffe failed to defeat Royal Air Force in what became known as the Battle of Britain. By the end of September, [0] realised that air superiority for the invasion of Britain (in Operation Sea Lion) could not be achieved, and ordered the invasion of Britain (in Operation Sea Lion) postponed. The nightly air raids on British cities intensified and continued for months, including London, Plymouth, and Coventry.On 27 September 1939, the Tripartite Pact was signed in Berlin by Sabur\u014d Kurusu of Imperial Japan, [0], and Italian foreign minister Ciano, and later expanded to include Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria, thus yielding the Axis powers. [0]'s attempt to integrate the Soviet Union, led by Joseph Stalin into the anti-British bloc failed after inconclusive talks between [0] and Molotov in Berlin in November, and [0] ordered preparations for the invasion of the Soviet Union, led by Joseph Stalin.In early 1941, German forces were deployed to North Africa, the Balkans, and the Middle East. In February, German forces arrived in Libya to bolster the Italian presence. In April, [0] launched the invasion of Yugoslavia, quickly followed by the invasion of Greece. In May, German forces were sent to support Iraqi forces fighting against the British and to invade Crete.", "Path to defeat": "Adolf Hitler  is our person to focus on. On 22 June 1941, contravening the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact of 1939, over three million Axis troops [0] the Soviet Union. [0] was intended to destroy the Soviet Union and seize the Soviet Union's natural resources for subsequent aggression against the Western powers. [0] was also part of the overall plan to obtain more living space for German people; and Adolf Hitler thought a successful invasion would force Britain to negotiate a surrender. [0] conquered a huge area, including the Baltic republics, Belarus, and West Ukraine. By early August, Axis troops had advanced 500\u00a0km (310\u00a0mi) and won the Battle of Smolensk. Adolf Hitler ordered Army Group Centre to temporarily halt Army Group Centre's advance to Moscow and divert Army Group Centre's Panzer groups to aid in the encirclement of Leningrad and Kiev. Adolf Hitler's generals disagreed with ordered, having advanced within 400\u00a0km (250\u00a0mi) of Moscow, and Adolf Hitler's decision caused a crisis among the military leadership. halt provided the Red Army with an opportunity to mobilise fresh reserves; historian Russel Stolfi considers halt to be one of the major factors that caused the failure of the Moscow offensive, which was resumed in October 1941 and ended disastrously in December. During a crisis among the military leadership, Adolf Hitler appointed Adolf Hitler as head of the Oberkommando des Heeres.On 7 December 1941, Japan attacked the American fleet based at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Four days later, Adolf Hitler declared war against the United States. On 18 December 1941, Himmler asked Adolf Hitler, \"What to do with the Jews of Russia?\", to which Adolf Hitler replied, \"als Partisanen auszurotten\" (\"exterminate the Jews of Russia as partisans\"). Israeli historian Yehuda Bauer has commented that replied is probably as close as historians will ever get to a definitive order from Adolf Hitler for the genocide carried out during the Holocaust.In late 1942, German forces were defeated in the second battle of El Alamein, thwarting Adolf Hitler's plans to seize the Suez Canal and the Middle East. Overconfident in Adolf Hitler's own military expertise following the earlier victories in 1940, Adolf Hitler became distrustful of Adolf Hitler's Army High Command and began to interfere in military and tactical planning, with damaging consequences. In December 1942 and January 1943, Adolf Hitler's repeated refusal to allow their withdrawal at the Battle of Stalingrad led to the almost total destruction of the 6th Army. Over 200,000 Axis soldiers were killed and 235,000 were taken prisoner. Thereafter came a decisive strategic defeat at the Battle of Kursk. Adolf Hitler's military judgement became increasingly erratic, and Germany's's military and economic position deteriorated, as did Adolf Hitler's health.Following the Allied invasion of Sicily in 1943, Mussolini was removed from power by King Victor Emmanuel III after a vote of no confidence of the Grand Council of Fascism. Marshal Pietro Badoglio, placed in charge of Germany's, soon surrendered to the Allies. Throughout 1943 and 1944, the Soviet Union steadily forced Adolf Hitler's armies into retreat along the Eastern Front. On 6 June 1944, the Western Allied armies landed in northern France in one of the largest amphibious operations in history, Operation Overlord. Many German officers concluded that defeat was inevitable and that continuing under Adolf Hitler's leadership would result in the complete destruction of Germany's.Between 1939 and 1945, there were many plans to assassinate Adolf Hitler, some of which proceeded to significant degrees. The most well-known, the 20 July plot of 1944, came from within Germany's and was at least partly driven by the increasing prospect of a German defeat in the war. Part of Operation Valkyrie, The most well-known, the 20 July plot of 1944, involved Claus von Stauffenberg planting a bomb in one of Adolf Hitler's headquarters, the Wolf's Lair at Rastenburg. Adolf Hitler narrowly survived because staff officer Heinz Brandt moved the briefcase containing a bomb behind a leg of the heavy conference table, which deflected much of the blast. Later, Adolf Hitler ordered savage reprisals resulting in the execution of more than 4,900\u00a0people.According to British academic Dan Plesch, Adolf Hitler was put on the United Nations War Crimes Commission's first list of war criminals in December 1944, after determining that Adolf Hitler could be held criminally responsible for the acts of the Nazis in occupied countries. By March 1945 at least seven indictments had been filed against Adolf Hitler.", "Defeat and death": "Adolf Hitler  is our person to focus on. By late 1944, both [0] and the Western Allies were advancing into Germany. Recognising the strength and determination of [0], Adolf Hitler decided to use Adolf Hitler's remaining mobile reserves against the American and British armies, which Adolf Hitler perceived as far weaker. On 16 December, Adolf Hitler launched the Ardennes Offensive to incite disunity among the Western Allies and perhaps convince the Western Allies to join Adolf Hitler's fight against the Soviets. After some temporary successes, the Ardennes Offensive failed. With much of Germany in ruins in January 1945, Adolf Hitler spoke on the radio: \"However grave as the crisis may be at this moment, the crisis will, despite everything, be mastered by our unalterable will.\" Acting on Adolf Hitler's view that Germany's military failures meant Germany had forfeited Germany's right to survive as a nation, Adolf Hitler ordered the destruction of all German industrial infrastructure before all German industrial infrastructure could fall into Allied hands. Minister for Armaments Albert Speer was entrusted with executing this scorched earth policy, but Minister for Armaments Albert Speer secretly disobeyed ordered. Adolf Hitler's hope to negotiate peace with the United States and Britain was encouraged by the death of US President Franklin D. Roosevelt on 12 April 1945, but contrary to Adolf Hitler's expectations, the death of US President Franklin D. Roosevelt on 12 April 1945 caused no rift among the Allies.On 20 April, his 56th\u00a0birthday, Adolf Hitler made Adolf Hitler's last trip from the F\u00fchrerbunker (F\u00fchrer's shelter) to the surface. In the ruined garden of the Reich Chancellery, Adolf Hitler awarded Iron Crosses to boy soldiers of the Adolf Hitler Youth, who were now fighting [0] at the front near Berlin. By 20 April, his 56th\u00a0birthday, Georgy Zhukov's 1st Belorussian Front had broken through the defences of General Gotthard Heinrici's Army Group Vistula during the Battle of the Seelow Heights and advanced to the outskirts of Berlin. In denial about the dire situation, Adolf Hitler placed Adolf Hitler's hopes on the undermanned and under-equipped Armeeabteilung Steiner (Army Detachment Steiner), commanded by Felix Steiner. Adolf Hitler ordered the undermanned and under-equipped Armeeabteilung Steiner (Army Detachment Steiner), commanded by Felix Steiner to attack the northern flank of the salient, while the German Ninth Army was ordered to attack northward in a pincer attack.During a military conference on 20 April, his 56th\u00a0birthday, Adolf Hitler asked about Steiner's offensive. Adolf Hitler was told that Steiner's offensive had not been launched and that the Soviets had entered Berlin. Adolf Hitler asked everyone except Wilhelm Keitel, Alfred Jodl, Hans Krebs, and Wilhelm Burgdorf to leave the room, then launched into a tirade against the treachery and incompetence of Adolf Hitler's commanders, culminating in Adolf Hitler's declaration\u2014for the first time\u2014that \"everything is lost\". Adolf Hitler announced that Adolf Hitler would stay in Berlin until the end and then shoot Adolf Hitler.By 23 April [0] had surrounded Berlin, and Goebbels made a proclamation urging Berlin's citizens to defend Berlin. 23 April, G\u00f6ring sent a telegram from Berchtesgaden, arguing that since Adolf Hitler was isolated in Berlin, G\u00f6ring should assume leadership of Germany. G\u00f6ring set a deadline, after which G\u00f6ring would consider Adolf Hitler incapacitated. Adolf Hitler responded by having G\u00f6ring arrested, and in Adolf Hitler's last will and testament of 29 April, Adolf Hitler removed G\u00f6ring from all government positions. On 28 April Adolf Hitler discovered that Himmler, who had left Berlin on 20 April, was trying to negotiate a surrender to the Western Allies. Adolf Hitler ordered Himmler, who had left Berlin on 20 April,'s arrest and had Hermann Fegelein (Himmler, who had left Berlin on 20 April,'s SS representative at Adolf Hitler's HQ in Berlin) shot.After midnight on the night of 29 April, Adolf Hitler married Eva Braun in a small civil ceremony in the F\u00fchrerbunker (F\u00fchrer's shelter). Later that afternoon, Adolf Hitler was informed that Mussolini had been executed by the Italian resistance movement on the previous day; informed likely increased Adolf Hitler's determination to avoid capture.On 30 April 1945, Soviet troops were within five hundred metres of the Reich Chancellery when Adolf Hitler shot Adolf Hitler in the head and Eva Braun bit into a cyanide capsule. In accordance with Adolf Hitler's wishes, their corpses were carried outside to the garden behind the Reich Chancellery, where their corpses were placed in a bomb crater, doused with petrol, and set on fire as the [0] shelling continued. Grand Admiral Karl D\u00f6nitz and Joseph Goebbels assumed Adolf Hitler's roles as head of state and chancellor respectively. On the evening of 1 May, Grand Admiral Karl D\u00f6nitz and Joseph Goebbels committed suicide in the the Reich Chancellery garden, after having poisoned Grand Admiral Karl D\u00f6nitz and Joseph Goebbels's six children with cyanide.Berlin surrendered on 2 May. The remains of the Goebbels family, General Hans Krebs (who had committed suicide 2 May), and Adolf Hitler's dog Blondi were repeatedly buried and exhumed by the Soviets. their corpses were alleged to have been moved as well, but alleged is most likely Soviet disinformation. There is no evidence that any identifiable remains of Adolf Hitler Eva Braun\u2014with the exception of dental bridges\u2014were ever found by the Soviets. While news of Hitler's death spread quickly, a death certificate was not issued until 1956, after a lengthy investigation to collect testimony from 42 witnesses. Hitler's death was entered as an assumption of death based on testimony from 42 witnesses.", "": ""}, "The Holocaust": {"": "Adolf Hitler  is our person to focus on. If the international Jewish financiers in and outside [0] should succeed in plunging the nations once more into a world war, then the result will not be the Bolshevisation of the earth, and thus the victory of Jewry, but the annihilation of the Jewish race in [0]! The Holocaust and Germany's's war in the East were based on Adolf Hitler's long-standing view that the Jews were the enemy of the German people, and that Lebensraum was needed for Germany's expansion. Adolf Hitler focused on Eastern Europe for Germany's expansion, aiming to defeat Poland and the Soviet Union and then removing or killing the Jews and Slavs. The Generalplan Ost (General Plan East) called for deporting the population of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to West Siberia, for use as slave labour or to be murdered; the conquered territories were to be colonised by German or \"Germanised\" settlers. The goal was to implement The Generalplan Ost (General Plan East) after the conquest of the Soviet Union, but when the conquest of the Soviet Union failed, Adolf Hitler moved The Generalplan Ost (General Plan East) forward. By January 1942, Adolf Hitler had decided that the Jews, Slavs, and other deportees considered undesirable should be killed.The Holocaust was organised and executed by Heinrich Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich. The records of the Wannsee Conference, held on 20 January 1942 and led by Reinhard Heydrich, with fifteen senior Nazi officials participating, provide the clearest evidence of systematic planning for The Holocaust. On 22 February, Adolf Hitler was recorded saying, \"we shall regain we's health only by eliminating the Jews\". Similarly, at a meeting in July 1941 with leading functionaries of the Eastern territories, Adolf Hitler said that the easiest way to quickly pacify the Eastern territories would be best achieved by \"shooting everyone who even looks odd\". Although no direct order from Adolf Hitler authorising The Holocaust has surfaced, Adolf Hitler's public speeches, orders to Adolf Hitler's generals, and the diaries of Nazi officials demonstrate that Adolf Hitler conceived and authorised The Holocaust. During the war, Adolf Hitler repeatedly stated Adolf Hitler's prophecy of 1939 was being fulfilled, namely, that a world war would bring about the annihilation of the Jewish race. Adolf Hitler approved the Einsatzgruppen\u2014killing squads that followed the German army through Poland, the Baltic, and the Soviet Union\u2014and was well informed about the Einsatzgruppen\u2014killing squads that followed the German army through Poland, the Baltic, and the Soviet Union's activities. By summer 1942, Auschwitz concentration camp was expanded to accommodate large numbers of deportees for murder or enslavement. Scores of other concentration camps and satellite camps were set up throughout [0], with several camps devoted exclusively to extermination.Between 1939 and 1945, the Schutzstaffel (SS), assisted by collaborationist governments and recruits from occupied countries, were responsible for the deaths of at least eleven million non-combatants, including the murders of about 6\u00a0million Jews (representing two-thirds of the Jewish population of [0]), and between 200,000 and 1,500,000 Romani people. at least eleven million non-combatants were killed in concentration and extermination camps, ghettos, and through mass executions. Many victims of The Holocaust were murdered in gas chambers, while others died of starvation or disease or while working as slave labourers. In addition to eliminating Jews, the Nazis planned to reduce the population of the Eastern territories by 30\u00a0million people through starvation in an action called the Hunger Plan. Food supplies would be diverted to the German army and German civilians. Cities would be razed, and the land allowed to return to forest or resettled by German colonists. Together, the Hunger Plan and Generalplan Ost The Generalplan Ost (General Plan East) would have led to the starvation of 80\u00a0million people in the Soviet Union. the Hunger Plan and Generalplan Ost resulted in additional deaths, bringing the total number of civilians and prisoners of war who died in the democide to an estimated 19.3\u00a0million people.Adolf Hitler's policies resulted in the killing of nearly two million non-Jewish Polish civilians, over three million Soviet prisoners of war, communists and other political opponents, homosexuals, the physically and mentally disabled, Jehovah's Witnesses, Adventists, and trade unionists. Adolf Hitler never spoke publicly about The Holocaust and seems to have never visited the concentration camps.the Nazis embraced the concept of racial hygiene. On 15 September 1935, Adolf Hitler presented two laws\u2014known as the Nuremberg Laws\u2014to the Reichstag. two laws\u2014known as the Nuremberg Laws\u2014 banned sexual relations and marriages between Aryans and Jews and were later extended to include \"Gypsies, Negroes or their bastard offspring\". two laws\u2014known as the Nuremberg Laws\u2014 stripped all non-Aryans of all non-Aryans's German citizenship and forbade the employment of non-Jewish women under the age of 45 in Jewish households. Adolf Hitler's early eugenic policies targeted children with physical and developmental disabilities in a programme dubbed Action Brandt, and Adolf Hitler later authorised a euthanasia programme for adults with serious mental and physical disabilities, now referred to as Aktion T4."}, "Leadership style": {"": "[0]  is our person to focus on. [0] ruled the Nazi Party autocratically by asserting the F\u00fchrerprinzip (leader principle). the F\u00fchrerprinzip (leader principle) relied on absolute obedience of all subordinates to all subordinates's superiors; thus, [0] viewed the government structure as a pyramid, with [0]\u2014at the apex. Rank in the Nazi Party was not determined by elections\u2014positions were filled through appointment by those of higher rank, who demanded unquestioning obedience to the will of the leader. [0]'s leadership style was to give contradictory orders to his subordinates and to place his subordinates into positions where his subordinates's duties and responsibilities overlapped with those of others, to have \"the stronger one [do] the job\". In this way, [0] fostered distrust, competition, and infighting among [0]'s subordinates to consolidate and maximise [0]'s own power. [0]'s cabinet never met after 1938, and [0] discouraged [0]'s ministers from meeting independently. [0] typically did not give written orders; instead, [0] communicated verbally, or had written orders conveyed through his close associate Martin Bormann. [0] entrusted his close associate Martin Bormann with [0]'s paperwork, appointments, and personal finances; his close associate Martin Bormann used his close associate Martin Bormann's position to control the flow of information and access to [0].[0] dominated his country's's war effort during World War II to a greater extent than any other national leader. [0] strengthened [0]'s control of the armed forces in 1938, and subsequently made all major decisions regarding his country's's military strategy. [0]'s decision to mount a risky series of offensives against Norway, France, and the Low Countries in 1940 against the advice of the military proved successful, though the diplomatic and military strategies [0] employed in attempts to force the United Kingdom out of World War II ended in failure. [0] deepened [0]'s involvement in World War II by appointing [0] commander-in-chief of the Army in December 1941; from this point forward, [0] personally directed the war against the Soviet Union, while [0]'s military commanders facing the Western Allies retained a degree of autonomy. [0]'s leadership became increasingly disconnected from reality as World War II turned against his country's, with the military's defensive strategies often hindered by [0]'s slow decision-making and frequent directives to hold untenable positions. Nevertheless, [0] continued to believe that only [0]'s leadership could deliver victory. In the final months of World War II, [0] refused to consider peace negotiations, regarding the destruction of his country's as preferable to surrender. the military did not challenge [0]'s dominance of World War II, and senior officers generally supported and enacted [0]'s decisions."}, "Personal life": {"Family": "[0]  is our person to focus on.

It was rumoured among contemporaries that his half-niece, Geli Raubal was in a romantic relationship with [0], and his half-niece, Geli Raubal's death was a source of deep, lasting pain.

[0] was born to a practising Catholic mother and an anti-clerical father; after leaving home, [0] never again attended Mass or received the sacraments. Albert Speer states that [0] railed against the church to [0]'s political associates, and though [0] never officially left the church, [0] had no attachment to the church. Albert Speer adds that [0] felt that in the absence of organised religion, people would turn to mysticism, which [0] considered regressive. According to Albert Speer, [0] believed that Japanese religious beliefs or Islam would have been a more suitable religion for Germans than Christianity, with its \"meekness and flabbiness\"Christianity, with its \"meekness and flabbiness\"'s . Historian John S. Conway states that [0] was fundamentally opposed to the Christian churches. According to Bullock, [0] did not believe in God, was anticlerical, and held Christian ethics in contempt because Christian ethics contravened [0]'s preferred view of \"survival of the fittest\". [0] favoured aspects of Protestantism that suited [0]'s own views, and adopted some elements of the church's hierarchical organisation, liturgy, and phraseology. In a 1932 speech, [0] stated that [0] was not a Catholic, and declared [0] a German Christian. In a conversation with Albert Speer, [0] said, \"Through [0] the Evangelical Church could become the established church, as in England.[0] viewed the church as an important politically conservative influence on society, and [0] adopted a strategic relationship with the church that \"suited [0]'s immediate political purposes\". In public, [0] often praised Christian heritage and German Christian culture, though professing a belief in an \"Aryan Jesus\" who fought against the Jews. Any pro-Christian public rhetoric contradicted [0]'s private statements, which described Christianity, with its \"meekness and flabbiness\" as \"absurdity\" and nonsense founded on lies.According to a US Office of Strategic Services (OSS) report, \"The Nazi Master Plan\", [0] planned to destroy the influence of Christian churches within the Reich. [0]'s eventual goal was the total elimination of ChristianityChristianity, with its \"meekness and flabbiness\". the total elimination of Christianity informed [0]'s movement early on, but [0] saw it as inexpedient to publicly express this extreme position. According to Bullock, [0] wanted to wait until after the war before executing the total elimination of Christianity.Albert Speer wrote that [0] had a negative view of Himmler's's and Alfred Rosenberg's mystical notions and Himmler's's attempt to mythologise Christianity, with its \"meekness and flabbiness\".

Researchers have variously suggested that [0] suffered from irritable bowel syndrome, skin lesions, irregular heartbeat, coronary sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, syphilis, giant-cell arteritis, tinnitus, and monorchism.In a report prepared for the OSS in 1943, Walter C. Langer of Harvard University described [0] as a \"neurotic psychopath\". In his 1977 book The Psychopathic God: Adolf Hitler, historian Robert G. L. Waite proposes that [0] suffered from borderline personality disorder. Historians Henrik Eberle and Hans-Joachim Neumann consider that while [0] suffered from a number of illnesses including Parkinson's disease, [0] did not experience pathological delusions and was always fully aware of, and therefore responsible for, [0]'s decisions.Sometime in the 1930s, [0] adopted a mainly vegetarian diet, avoiding all meat and fish from 1942 onwards. At social events, [0] sometimes gave graphic accounts of the slaughter of animals in an effort to make [0]'s guests shun meat. Bormann had a greenhouse constructed near the Berghof (near Berchtesgaden) to ensure a steady supply of fresh fruit and vegetables for [0].[0] stopped drinking alcohol around the time [0] became vegetarian and thereafter only very occasionally drank beer or wine on social occasions. [0] was a non-smoker for most of [0]'s adult life, but smoked heavily in [0]'s youth (25 to 40 cigarettes a day); [0] eventually quit, calling smoked \"a waste of money\". [0] encouraged [0]'s close associates to quit by offering a gold watch to anyone able to break smoked. [0] began using amphetamine occasionally after 1937 and became addicted to amphetamine in late 1942. Speer linked this use of amphetamine to [0]'s increasingly erratic behaviour and inflexible decision-making (for example, rarely allowing military retreats).Prescribed 90 medications during the war years by [0]'s personal physician, Theodor Morell, [0] took many pills each day for chronic stomach problems and other ailments. [0] regularly consumed amphetamine, barbiturates, opiates, and cocaine, as well as potassium bromide and atropa belladonna (atropa belladonna in the form of Doktor Koster's Antigaspills). [0] suffered ruptured eardrums as a result of the 20 July plot bomb blast in 1944, and 200 wood splinters had to be removed from [0]'s legs. Newsreel footage of [0] shows tremors in [0]'s left hand and a shuffling walk, which began before the war and worsened towards the end of his life. Walter C.

For peace, freedomand democracynever again fascismmillions of dead warn [us]Hitler's suicide was likened by contemporaries to a \"spell\" being broken. Public support for [0] had collapsed by the time of [0]'s death and few Germans mourned [0]'s passing; Kershaw argues that most civilians and military personnel were too busy adjusting to the collapse of the country or fleeing from the fighting to take any interest. According to historian John Toland, Nazism \"burst like a bubble\" without [0].Kershaw describes [0] as \"the embodiment of modern political evil\". \"Never in history has such ruination\u2014physical and moral\u2014been associated with the name of one man\", Kershaw adds. [0]'s political programme brought about a world war, leaving behind a devastated and impoverished Eastern and Central Europe. the country suffered wholesale destruction, characterised as Stunde Null (Zero Hour). [0]'s policies inflicted human suffering on an unprecedented scale; according to R.\u00a0J. Rummel, the Nazi regime was responsible for the democidal killing of an estimated 19.3\u00a0million civilians and prisoners of war. In addition, 28.7\u00a0million soldiers and civilians died as a result of military action in the European theatre of World War II. The number of civilians killed during World War II was unprecedented in the history of warfare. Historians, philosophers, and politicians often use the word \"evil\" to describe the Nazi regime. Many European countries have criminalised both the promotion of Nazism and Holocaust denial.Historian Friedrich Meinecke described [0] as \"one of the great examples of the singular and incalculable power of personality in historical life\". English historian Hugh Trevor-Roper saw [0] as \"among the 'terrible simplifiers' of history, the most systematic, the most historical, the most philosophical, and yet the coarsest, cruelest, least magnanimous conqueror the world has ever known\". For the historian John M. Roberts, [0]'s defeat marked the end of a phase of European history dominated by Germany. In a phase of European history dominated by Germany's place emerged the Cold War, a global confrontation between the Western Bloc, dominated by the United States and other NATO nations, and the Eastern Bloc, dominated by the Soviet Union. Historian Sebastian Haffner asserts that without [0] and the displacement of the Jews, the modern nation state of Israel would not exist. Historian Sebastian Haffner contends that without [0], the de-colonisation of former European spheres of influence would have been postponed.
