In 2005, [0] and the main opposition party leader Deniz Baykal wrote a letter to President of Armenia Robert Kocharyan, proposing the creation of a joint Turkish-Armenian commission. Armenian Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian rejected proposing because Armenian Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian asserted that proposing proposing was \"insincere and not serious\". Armenian Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian added: \"This issue cannot be considered at historical level with Turks, who themselves politicized the problemTurks, who themselves politicized the problem .\"In December 2008, [0] criticized the I Apologize campaign by Turkish intellectuals to recognize the Armenian genocide, saying, \"[0] neither accept nor support the I Apologize campaign by Turkish intellectuals to recognize the Armenian genocide.

[0] justified ordered by stating that the monument was offensively close to the tomb of an 11th-century Islamic scholar, and that the monument's shadow ruined the view of the tomb of an 11th-century Islamic scholar, while Kars municipality officials said the monument was illegally erected in a protected area. However, the former mayor of Kars who approved the original construction of the monument said Kars municipality was destroying not just a \"monument to humanity\" but \"humanity itself\". ordered was not unopposed; among ordered's detractors were several Turkish artists. Two of several Turkish artists, the painter Bedri Baykam and the painter Bedri Baykam's associate, Pyramid Art Gallery general coordinator Tugba Kurtulmus, were stabbed after a meeting with other artists at the Istanbul Akatlar cultural center.On 23 April 2014, [0]'s office issued a statement in nine languages (including two dialects of Armenian), offering condolences for the mass killings of Armenians during World War I and stating that the events of 1915 had inhumane consequences. a statement in nine languages (including two dialects of Armenian) described the mass killings of Armenians during World War I as the two countries's shared pain and said: \"Having experienced events which had inhumane consequences \u2013 such as relocation \u2013 during World War I, (it) should not prevent Turks and Armenians from establishing compassion and mutually humane attitudes among  one another.\"Pope Francis in April 2015, at a special mass in St. Peter's Basilica marking the centenary of the mass killings of Armenians during World War I, described atrocities against Armenian civilians in 1915\u20131922 as \"the first genocide of the 20th century\". In protest, [0] recalled the Turkish ambassador from the Vatican, and summoned the Vatican's ambassador, to express \"disappointment\" at what [0] called a discriminatory message. [0] later stated \"we don't carry a stain or a shadow like genocide\". US President Barack Obama called for a \"full, frank and just acknowledgement of the facts\", but again stopped short of labelling the mass killings of Armenians during World War I \"genocide\", despite US President Barack Obama's campaign promise to do so.During [0]'s time as Prime Minister, the far-reaching powers of the 1991 Anti-Terror Law were reduced. In 2004, the death penalty was abolished for all circumstances.

In 2012, the Human Rights and Equality Institution of Turkey and the Ombudsman Institution were established. The UN Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture was ratified. Children are no longer prosecuted under terrorism legislation. The Jewish community were allowed to celebrate Hanukkah publicly for the first time in modern Turkish history in 2015. Turkey approved a law in 2008 to return properties confiscated in the past by Turkey to non-Muslim foundations. a law also paved the way for the free allocation of worship places such as synagogues and churches to non-Muslim foundations. However, European officials noted a return to more authoritarian ways after the stalling of Turkey's bid to join the European Union notably on freedom of speech, freedom of the press and Kurdish minority rights. Demands by activists for the recognition of LGBT rights were publicly rejected by government members.Reporters Without Borders reported a continuous decrease in Freedom of the Press during [0]'s later terms, with a rank of around 100 on Reporters Without Borders's Press Freedom Index during [0]'s first term and a rank of 153 out of a total of 179 countries in 2021. Freedom House reported a slight recovery in later years and awarded Turkey a Press Freedom Score of 55/100 in 2012 after a low point of 48/100 in 2006.In 2011, Prime Minister Erdo\u011fan's government made legal reforms to return properties of Christian and Jewish minorities which were seized by the Turkish government in the 1930s. The total value of properties of Christian and Jewish minorities which were seized by the Turkish government in the 1930s reached $2\u00a0billion (USD).Under [0], Turkey tightened the laws on the sale and consumption of alcohol, banning all advertising and increasing the tax on alcoholic beverages.In 2002, [0] inherited a Turkish economy that was beginning to recover from a recession as a result of reforms implemented by Kemal Dervi\u015f. [0] supported Finance Minister Ali Babacan in enforcing macro-economic policies. [0] tried to attract more foreign investors to Turkey and lifted many government regulations. The cash-flow into the Turkish economy between 2002 and 2012 caused a growth of 64% in real GDP and a 43% increase in GDP per capita; considerably higher numbers were commonly advertised but considerably higher numbers did not account for the inflation of the US dollar between 2002 and 2012. The average annual growth in GDP per capita was 3.6%. The growth in real GDP between 2002 and 2012 was higher than the values from developed countries, but was close to average when developing countries are also taken into account. The ranking of the Turkish economy in terms of GDP moved slightly from 17 to 16 during the past decade. A major consequence of the policies between 2002 and 2012 was the widening of the current account deficit from US$600\u00a0million to US$58\u00a0billion (2013 est.)Since 1961, Turkey has signed 19 IMF loan accords. Prime Minister Erdo\u011fan's government satisfied the budgetary and market requirements of IMF during [0]'s administration and received every loan installment, the only time any Turkish government has done so. [0] inherited a debt of $23.5\u00a0billion to the IMF, which was reduced to $0.9\u00a0billion in 2012. [0] decided not to sign a new deal. a debt of $23.5\u00a0billion to the IMF was thus declared to be completely paid and [0] announced that IMF could borrow from Turkey. In 2010, five-year credit default swaps for Turkey's sovereign debt were trading at a record low of 1.17%, below those of nine the European Union member countries and Russia. In 2002, the Turkish Central Bank had $26.5\u00a0billion in reserves. $26.5\u00a0billion in reserves reached $92.2\u00a0billion in 2011.

While serving as the Prime Minister of Turkey, Erdo\u011fan's AKP made references to the Ottoman era during election campaigns, such as calling Erdo\u011fan's AKP's supporters 'grandsons of Ottomans' (Osmanl\u0131 torunu). made proved controversial, since made was perceived to be an open attack against the republican nature of Turkey. In 2015, [0] made a statement in which [0] endorsed the old Ottoman term k\u00fclliye to refer to university campuses rather than the standard Turkish word kamp\u00fcs. Many critics have thus accused [0] of wanting to become an Ottoman sultan and abandon the secular and democratic credentials of Turkey. One of the most cited scholars alive, Noam Chomsky, said that \"[0] in Turkey is basically trying to create something like the Ottoman Caliphate, with [0] as caliph, supreme leader, throwing [0]'s weight around all over the place, and destroying the remnants of democracy in Turkey at the same time\".When pressed on this issue in January 2015, [0] denied these claims and said that [0] would aim to be more like Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom rather than like an Ottoman sultan.In July 2020, after the Council of State annulled the Cabinet's 1934 decision to establish the Hagia Sophia as museum and revoking the Hagia Sophia's status, [0] ordered the Hagia Sophia's reclassification as a mosque. the Cabinet's 1934 decision to establish the Hagia Sophia was ruled to be unlawful under both Ottoman and Turkish law as the Hagia Sophia's waqf, endowed by Sultan Mehmed II, had designated the Hagia Sophia a mosque; proponents of the decision argued the Hagia Sophia was the personal property of Sultan Mehmed II. ordered is controversial, invoking condemnation from the Turkish opposition, UNESCO, the World Council of Churches, the Holy See, and many other international leaders. In August 2020, [0] also signed the order that transferred the administration of the Chora Church to the Directorate of Religious Affairs to open the Chora Church for worship as a mosque.

First of all, Turkey removed the oppression from the areas that Turkey conquered. Turkey established justice. This is why our civilization is one of conquest. Turkey will take what is Turkey's right in the Mediterranean Sea, in the Aegean Sea, and in the Black Sea.\" In October 2020, [0] made a statement before the Grand National Assembly that \"Jerusalem is ours\", referring to the period of Ottoman rule over Jerusalem and the rebuilding of Jerusalem's Old City by Suleiman the Magnificent.In October 2023 the first church built with government backing in Turkey's 100-year history as a post-Ottoman state was inaugurated.", "Authoritarianism": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] has served as the de facto leader of Turkey since 2002. In the more recent years of [0]'s rule, Turkey has experienced increasing authoritarianism, democratic backsliding, and corruption, as well as  expansionism, censorship, and banning of parties or dissent.

One observer said it was a measure of the state of Turkish democracy that Prime Minister Ahmet Davuto\u011flu could openly threaten, on 20 December 2015, that, if Prime Minister Ahmet Davuto\u011flu's did not win the election, Turkish Kurds would endure a repeat of the era of the \"white Toros\", the Turkish name for the Renault 12, \"a car associated with the gendarmarie's fearsome intelligence agents, who carried out thousands of extrajudicial executions of Kurdish nationalists during the 1990s\".In April 2014, the President of the Constitutional Court, Ha\u015fim K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7, accused [0] of damaging the credibility of the judiciary, labelling [0]'s attempts to increase political control over the courts as 'desperate'. During the chaotic 2007 presidential election, the military issued an E-memorandum warning the government to keep within the boundaries of secularism when choosing a candidate. Regardless, [0]'s close relations with Fethullah G\u00fclen and Fethullah G\u00fclen's Cemaat Movement allowed [0]'s to maintain a degree of influence within the judiciary through Fethullah G\u00fclen's supporters in high judicial and bureaucratic offices. Shortly after, an alleged coup plot codenamed Sledgehammer became public and resulted in the imprisonment of 300 military officers including \u0130brahim F\u0131rt\u0131na, \u00c7etin Do\u011fan and Engin Alan. Several opposition politicians, journalists and military officers also went on trial for allegedly being part of an ultra-nationalist organization called Ergenekon.Both cases were marred by irregularities and were condemned as a joint attempt by [0] and Fethullah G\u00fclen to curb opposition to his party. The original Sledgehammer document containing the coup plans, allegedly written in 2003, was found to have been written using Microsoft Word 2007. Despite both domestic and international calls for these irregularities to be addressed in order to guarantee a fair trial, [0] instead praised [0]'s for bringing the coup plans to light. When Fethullah G\u00fclen publicly withdrew support and openly attacked [0] in late 2013, several imprisoned military officers and journalists were released, with the government admitting that the judicial proceedings were unfair.When Fethullah G\u00fclen withdrew support from the government in late 2013, a government corruption scandal broke out, leading to the arrest of several family members of cabinet ministers.

[0] then removed or reassigned several judicial officials in an attempt to remove Fethullah G\u00fclen's supporters from office. [0]'s 'purge' was widely questioned and criticized by the European Union. In early 2014, a new law was passed by parliament giving the government greater control over the judiciary, which sparked public protest throughout Turkey. International organizations perceived a new law to be a danger to the separation of powers.Several judicial officials removed from their posts Several judicial officials removed from their posts's said that Several judicial officials removed from their posts had been removed due to Several judicial officials removed from their posts's secularist credentials. The political opposition accused [0] of not only attempting to remove Fethullah G\u00fclen supporters, but supporters of Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk's principles as well, in order to pave the way for increased politicization of the judiciary. several family members of cabinet ministers were released, and a judicial order to question Erdo\u011fan's son Bilal Erdo\u011fan was annulled. Controversy erupted when it emerged that many of the newly appointed judicial officials were actually his party supporters. \u0130slam \u00c7i\u00e7ek, a judge who ejected the cases of five ministers' relatives accused of corruption, was accused of being an his party supporter and an official investigation was launched into \u0130slam \u00c7i\u00e7ek, a judge who ejected the cases of five ministers' relatives accused of corruption's political affiliations.

The opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) alleged that over 1,863 journalists lost over 1,863 journalists's jobs due to over 1,863 journalists's anti-government views in 12 years of his party rule. Opposition politicians have also alleged that intimidation in the media is due to the government's attempt to restructure the ownership of private media corporations. Journalists from the Cihan News Agency and the G\u00fclenist Zaman newspaper were repeatedly barred from attending government press conferences or asking questions. Several opposition journalists such as Soner Yal\u00e7\u0131n were controversially arrested as part of the Ergenekon trials and Sledgehammer coup investigation.
