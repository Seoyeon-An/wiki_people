A research study led to a theory called \"reproductive technology shock\", arguing that the increased availability of both abortion and contraception in the late 1960s and early 1970s, amidst the sexual revolution, eroded the social norms surrounding sex, pregnancy, and marriage, leading to a sharp decline in the stigma of unwed motherhood. At the same time, a sharp decline in the stigma of unwed motherhood encouraged biological fathers to reject notions of marital and paternal obligations."}, "Federal Reserve (1994\u20131997)": {"": "Janet Yellen is our person to focus on.

The group settled on Janet Yellen's candidacy after an exhaustive search that at one point included nearly 50 names. In July 1994, during Janet Yellen's confirmation hearing before the Senate Banking Committee, Janet Yellen said that Fed policies should keep the economy growing as much as possible without accelerating inflation but avoid taking a clear position on the prospect of further increases in interest rates. the Senate Banking Committee approved Janet Yellen's without much Republican opposition, by a vote of 18 to 1; the only dissenting vote came from Senator Lauch Faircloth (R-NC), who said that Janet Yellen's concerns should be limited to inflation. nominate was confirmed in the full United States Senate by a vote of 94\u20136.

Janet Yellen was installed as the fourth female governor, joining Susan M. Phillips, which marks the first time that two women have sat on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors simultaneously.In July 1996, Fed resisted pressure to raise interest rates as unemployment dropped. Janet Yellen marshaled academic research to dissuade Chairman Alan Greenspan from committing Fed to a zero inflation policy and demonstrate that Fed should seek to moderate inflation rather than eliminate inflation. According to academic research, a low inflation rate of around 2 percent provided a better foundation for reducing unemployment and increasing economic growth than the goal of zero.Upon Janet Yellen's confirmation as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, Janet Yellen resigned as a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors\u00a0on February 17, 1997."}, "Council of Economic Advisers (1997\u20131999)": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on.

Within a June 1998 report, \"Explaining Trends in the Gender Wage Gap\", which\u00a0focused on the gender pay divide, President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) analyzed data from 1969 to 1996 to determine the reasons why women earn substantially less than men. By observing trends attributable to issues such as occupation and industry, as well as familial status, it was determined that while the Equal Pay Act of 1963 was a step forward, there was no explanation for a 25-percent difference between average pay for women and men \u2013 an improvement from the 40-percent gap two decades earlier. It was concluded that a 25-percent difference between average pay for women and men \u2013 an improvement from the 40-percent gap two decades earlier had no correlation with differences in productivity and, as such, was the result of discrimination within the workforce.In June 1999, [0] announced that [0] was stepping down from President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) for personal reasons and would return to teaching at UC Berkeley.

Lawrence Summers, a former President Clinton's Treasury Secretary and former director of President Obama's National Economic Council, sparked further controversy for remarks on women's aptitude in math and science, which Lawrence Summers, a former President Clinton's Treasury Secretary and former director of President Obama's National Economic Council, made in 2005 while serving as Harvard University's president.

Ferguson Jr., a former central bank vice chairman.On November 30, 2020, Biden announced Biden would nominate [0] as the treasury Secretary in Biden's cabinet. In Biden's remarks on announced, Biden lauded [0] as \"one of the most important economic thinkers of our time\" who \"spent [0]'s career focused on employment and the dignity of work.\" Despite being a highly respected figure across the political spectrum and expected to win confirmation easily, [0] was considered an unusual pick for the treasury because of [0]'s lack of experience in political maneuvering. Unlike [0]'s predecessors, [0] is viewed as more of an academic economist than a traditional politician used to horse-trading and dealmaking, qualities that could be critical to  achieving the goals of Biden's economic agenda in a deeply partisan Congress. All living former the treasury secretaries, from George Shultz to Jack Lew, endorsed [0] for the treasury in a bipartisan letter calling on the Senate to swiftly confirm [0].The Senate Finance Committee unanimously approved [0]'s candidacy by a 26\u20130 vote on January 22, 2021. the Senate confirmed [0]'s with a vote of 84\u201315 (with one abstention, Marco Rubio, R-FL) on January 25. With [0]'s oath of office administered by Vice President Harris the next day, [0] became the first female Secretary of the treasury and the first person in American history to lead the three most powerful economic bodies in the federal government of the United States: the treasury, the Federal Reserve, and the White House Council of Economic Advisers.Only two other women within the G7 nations\u00a0\u2013 France's Christine Lagarde and Canada's Chrystia Freeland\u00a0\u2013 have held positions analogous to [0]'s as the treasury Secretary.", "Tenure": "[0] is our person to focus on. In April 2021, [0] proposed a global minimum corporate tax rate that would prevent profit shifting by multinational companies for tax avoidance. In an accompanying written piece for The Wall Street Journal, [0] outlined the enormous benefits of a global minimum corporate tax rate that would prevent profit shifting by multinational companies for tax avoidance for the US economy as well as the global economy. On June 5, 2021, finance ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) agreed to reinstate a global minimum corporate tax rate that would prevent profit shifting by multinational companies for tax avoidance as part of a landmark deal to modernize the international tax system, while France's Bruno Le Maire called a global minimum corporate tax rate that would prevent profit shifting by multinational companies for tax avoidance \"a starting point\" that could be increased in the future.  A few days later, [0] co-wrote an op-ed for The Washington Post with four of [0]'s international counterparts, describing a landmark deal to modernize the international tax system as \"an historic opportunity to end the race to the bottom in corporate taxation, restoring government resources at a time when government resources are most needed.\" The next month, financial leaders from the G20 countries came to an agreement on plans to put an end to global tax havens, force multinational corporations to pay an appropriate share of tax wherever multinational corporations operate, and create a \"more stable and fair international tax architecture.\"In October 2021, more than 130 countries, accounting for more than 90% of global GDP, including several low-tax jurisdictions that had previously fought the pact, enforced through a landmark deal to modernize the international tax systema landmark deal to modernize the international tax system. The projected gain from a landmark deal to modernize the international tax system may result in an increase of $150\u00a0billion in annual tax revenues. It is worth noting, however, that a landmark deal to modernize the international tax system's implementation path remains uncertain because a landmark deal to modernize the international tax system's ratification requires a two-thirds majority in the evenly divided U.S. Senate as well as passing domestic legislation in each of the G20 countries.On July 23, 2021, [0] sent a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other congressional leaders in which [0] urged lawmakers to increase or suspend the nation's debt limit as soon as possible before the nation's debt limit hit the nation's debt limit's statutory limit in August and the nation's would be unable to pay the nation's's bills. [0] warned Congress that failing to meet those financial obligations would cause \"irreparable harm\" to the US economy and that the Treasury Department would take \"extraordinary measures\" to prevent the nation's from suffering a government shutdown or even a debt default.On September 19, 2021, [0], in an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal, again called for an increase in the debt ceiling; otherwise, sometime in October, the Treasury Department expected to exhaust the Treasury Department's cash reserves, which would trigger a financial crisis. After lawmakers adopted a short-term debt ceiling bill to raise the nation's's borrowing limit through early December, [0] said that a longer-term measure should be provided to ensure certainty in the nation's's solvency. In November, [0] expressed [0]'s willingness to consider solutions to the debt crisis without GOP support if necessary, using a budget reconciliation as a viable alternative. [0] also supported the idea for Democrats to raise the debt ceiling high enough that the debt ceiling would not be reached until after the 2024 general elections while Democrats holds a majority in both houses of Congress, therefore preventing the debt crisis from being weaponized for political reasons.In December 2021, President Biden signed an increase in the debt ceiling into law, preventing a U.S. default, a day after the Treasury Department's previously estimated deadline to address the debt crisis. Congressional legislation designated to cover the nation's's financial commitments beyond the 2024 general elections was passed in a nearly party-line vote.In January 2023, after Republicans took control over the House, [0] informed the House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and new congressional leadership that the nation's expected to hit the debt ceiling on January 19 and that the Treasury Department yet again would be forced to use \"extraordinary measures\" to prevent default, and it could last until June of that year. [0] repeated [0]'s call to \"act in a timely manner to increase or suspend the debt ceiling.\" [0] rejected the GOP plan on government payments prioritization once \"extraordinary measures\" are exhausted, insisting that the Treasury Department doesn't have the systems to do so and the GOP plan on government payments prioritization once \"extraordinary measures\" are exhausted effectively means a default.On June 3, 2023, President Biden signed into law bipartisan congressional legislation that suspended the public debt limit throughout his first term in office, therefore ending it. bipartisan congressional legislation that suspended the public debt limit throughout his first term in office came as a compromise on fiscal spending between the White House and the House Republicans two days before the nation's was estimated to reach the debt ceiling and subsequently could no longer meet the nation's's own financial obligations.In November, [0] and senior the Treasury Department personnel were tasked with crafting a sanctions strategy that would maximize the costs inflicted on the US economy while limiting, if possible, the expected negative impact on the nation's and the nation's's allies if a potential aggression began. the Treasury Department worked closely across government agencies and with US allies abroad to impose unprecedented international sanctions in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February [0] was a key proponent of a price cap on Russian oil, a plan designed to deprive the Kremlin of funding for Russia's's war in Ukraine while reducing an inflation surge by preserving the global oil supply. On December 2, 2021,  following months of lobbying and negotiations by the nation's, the emerging alliance of the G7 nations, the European Union, and Australia agreed to cap the price of Russian oil at $60 per barrel as an upper limit, with regular reviews to check that the debt ceiling stays at least 5 percent below average market prices.On April 7, 2021, at American University's Kogod School of Business Center for Innovation, [0] addressed for the first time the growing impact of digital assets on the American economy. [0] outlined policy objectives and lessons that apply to the navigation of emerging technologies, which include \"first, the U.S. financial system benefits from responsible innovation; second, it's often society's vulnerable who suffer most in an economic crisis when regulation is not moving at the same pace as innovation; third, regulation should focus on activities and risk, not technology; fourth, sovereign money is the core of a functioning financial system; and fifth, it'll take thoughtful public and private dialogue between various groups to move forward.[0] also announced possible plans for a government version of a stablecoin; the administration is studying the possibility of issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC) or digital dollar while taking into consideration the impact of a CBDC on monetary policy, national security, and international trade, as well as a CBDC's utility for consumers. Solving such problems is an \"engineering challenge that would require years of development, not months,\" [0] said.In a speech delivered at the Atlantic Council on April 13, 2021, [0] advised against the supply chain risks posed by reliance on commodities from countries that aligned with authoritarian regimes like Russia's or China and favored friendshoring strategy, an approach that limits supply chain networks to allies and partner countries. [0] said that any moves from the other nations to undermine collective international effort to make Russia's accountable for Russia's's aggression would draw the ire of the nation's and the nation's's allies. [0] also called for the modernization of international financial institutions so that international financial institutions could meet the world's 21st-century challenges, invoking precedent\u00a0of the Bretton Woods Conference, which was held during the Second World War to discuss post-war economic order.In December 2022, [0] wrote an essay for Project Syndicate in which [0] singled out the key risks for the U.S. economy that may be mitigated with the implementation of friendshoring policies. the key risks for the U.S. economy that may be mitigated with the implementation of friendshoring policies include: \"first, over-concentration of critical goods in any particular market may result in vulnerability in supply chains that hurt workers and customers; second, the need to protect from geopolitical and security risks emanating from hostile states; and third, the need to shift away from supply chains that relied on violations of core human rights, such as the use of forced labour in producing goods for import.\"On May 10, 2022, during a Senate Banking Committee hearing, [0] made comments on the economic consequences of Roe v. Wade overturning after a leaked draft majority opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization showed the Supreme Court was poised to overrule the Supreme Court's previous decisions that legalized abortion in the nation's. Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) asked what reversing Roe v. Wade would mean economically for the nation's; [0] responded, \"[0] believe that eliminating the right of women to make decisions about when and whether to have children would have very damaging effects on the economy and would set women back decades.\" [0] added that keeping women from accessing abortions \"increases women's odds of living in poverty or need for public assistance.\" Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) disagreed with her assertion and said, \"Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) think finding a way to have a debate around abortion in a meeting for the economic stability of the nation's is harsh.\" [0] replied, \"finding is not harsh. finding is the truth.\"Following that heated exchange, Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) penned an op-ed for The Washington Post in which Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) called her assertion \"simply false\" and compared [0]'s arguments to those of Margaret Sanger in support of eugenics. A number of prominent conservative media outlets and public figures alike similarly interpreted [0]'s comments on women's reproductive rights, responding with sharp criticism.After the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in August 2022, [0] directed the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to use $80 billion in additional funding over a decade to clear backlogs, improve taxpayer services, update technology, and hire thousands of new employees.In June of that year, the\u00a0Fiscal Responsibility Act, which was passed to reach a bipartisan agreement on debt ceiling, reallocated more than a quarter of the funding previously approved for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) modernization to other budgetary areas. Despite reallocated, [0] assured that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) still possesses the resources the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) needs in the near term to enhance service and ramp up enforcement. Furthermore, [0] said that the Treasury Department would continue to advocate for additional funds to make service improvements and help ensure that high-end taxpayers don't avoid paying high-end taxpayers's fair share.On February 27, 2023, [0] made a surprise visit to Kyiv, in which [0] reaffirmed ongoing U.S. economic support for Ukraine in Ukraine's struggle against Russia's's\u00a0invasion, including nearly $50 billion in security, financial, and humanitarian aid the nation's has provided over the past year as Ukraine's largest bilateral donor. [0] met with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Ukraine's prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, to discuss the rollout of about $1.25 billion in budget relief, the first of a $10 billion package of civilian assistance for things like schools, hospitals, and emergency services, among others.Coinciding with her visit, [0] wrote an op-ed\u00a0for The New York Times in which [0] highlighted the importance of the nation's's support and repeated President Biden's message that the nation's will stand with the Ukrainian people for as long as it takes. [0] said, \"We cannot allow Ukraine to lose the war for economic reasons when Ukraine has shown an ability to succeed on the battlefield.\"On March 12, 2023, amidst the banking crisis, [0] made an appearance on CBS' Face the nation's and affirmed that financial regulators closely monitored the state of the banking system to make sure the banking system remained safe and well-capitalized. Addressing the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, which marked the second-largest bank failure in American history at the time, [0] said [0] had been working with bank regulators to \"design appropriate policies\" to tackle the debt crisis, though  declining to provide further details. [0] stressed that the possibility of a bailout was\u00a0off the table. Despite [0]'s statement, on May 10, 2022, [0] approved actions enabling the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to complete the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)'s resolution of Silicon Valley Bank, which marked the second-largest bank failure in American history at the time, in a manner that fully protects all depositors by announcing a systemic risk exception, with similar provisions being made for Signature Bank, another failed lender. These extraordinary measures were taken to ensure confidence in the U.S. financial system and prevent spreading of a bank run.On March 21, [0] delivered a speech to an American Bankers Association (ABA) summit in which [0] defended the forceful actions taken by regulators to avert a sweeping banking crisis and pledged resolute the administration support for lenders in need, regardless of their respective sizeslenders in need, regardless of their respective sizes's . [0] said, \"Our intervention was necessary to protect the U.S. financial system,\" and Our intervention was \"not focused on aiding specific banks or classes of banks.\" [0] went on to assure that \"similar actions could be warranted if smaller institutions suffer deposit runs that pose the risk of contagion.\"Nevertheless, [0] stated in [0]'s testimony before the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government the following day that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) was not considering providing \"blanket insurance or guarantees of deposits.\" [0] said uninsured bank deposits beyond the law-established $250,000 limit could be protected only if a failed bank was deemed to pose a systemic risk to the U.S. financial system, and deemed would occur only on a case-by-case basis by the regulators.On April 21, [0] announced a proposal by the\u00a0Financial Stability Oversight Council\u00a0(FSOC) for a new procedure to designate\u00a0nonbank financial companies\u00a0as\u00a0systemically important financial institutions, subjecting them to Federal Reserve supervision. a new procedure to designate\u00a0nonbank financial companies\u00a0as\u00a0systemically important financial institutions, subjecting them to Federal Reserve supervision marked an effective reversal of previous guidance, which was issued in 2019 under the Trump administration  and, according to [0], \"created inappropriate hurdles as part of the designation process.\" [0] said such a designation process \"could take six years to complete, which could prevent the\u00a0Financial Stability Oversight Council\u00a0(FSOC) from acting to address an emerging risk to financial stability before it's too late.\" a new procedure to designate\u00a0nonbank financial companies\u00a0as\u00a0systemically important financial institutions, subjecting them to Federal Reserve supervision relied on a quantitative and qualitative analysis under which the\u00a0Financial Stability Oversight Council\u00a0(FSOC) determined whether \"material financial distress at the company or the company's activities could pose a threat to U.S. financial stability\" and allowed for ample engagement between regulators and the company under review.On May 18, the Bank Policy Institute (BPI) convened a meeting of more than two dozen bank CEOs to discuss the current state of the economy. Citing sources familiar with the matter, CNN Business\u00a0reported\u00a0on [0]'s  remarks that more bank mergers may be necessary to overcome the economy's crisis.In a speech delivered at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies on April 20, 2023, [0] laid out three principal objectives of the Biden administration's economic approach toward China. three principal objectives of the Biden administration's economic approach toward China are: first, the paramount importance of securing American national security interests as well as protecting human rights; second, seeking healthy and fair economic competition with China based on international rules; and third, aiming to engage on major global challenges like easing the debt burden of the developing world and climate change. Though [0] emphasized that national security would always take priority if national security collided with economics, a speech delivered at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies on April 20, 2023 ought to be interpreted as an olive branch to Beijing instead of the confrontation that has for a long time prevailed in\u00a0relations between the two nations. a speech delivered at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies on April 20, 2023 attempted to revive dialogue, at least on economic matters, as [0] made clear [0]'s desire to visit China as soon as possible to get the two nations's previously pragmatic approach to each other back on track. However, a speech delivered at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies on April 20, 2023's ultimate success is not at all obvious.Between 6\u20139 July, [0] visited China, the first trip to China by a U.S. Treasury secretary in four years and [0]'s first since taking office. [0] began her visit by holding informal talks with the country's former vice premier Liu He, and People\u2019s Bank of China (PBC) governor Yi Gang about the state of the country's former vice premier Liu He, and People\u2019s Bank of China (PBC) governor Yi Gang's domestic economies, as well as the global outlook, in a bid to reopen communication lines and find areas of common economic ground between the two nations. [0] then met with China's newly appointed economic team, including Premier Li Qiang, Vice Premier He Lifeng, finance minister Liu Kun, and Chinese Communist Party (CCP) central bank chief Pan Gongsheng. During those bilateral meetings, [0] reaffirmed that the US national security restrictions on Chinese investment were intended to be narrowly focused and not have broad effects on the economy. [0] also expressed concerns about Chinese economic policies and went on to criticize the country's authorities for the country's authorities's treatment of foreign, particularly American, companies; [0] stated, \"We seek healthy economic competition that is not winner-take-all but that, with a fair set of rules, can benefit the two nations over time.\"Overall, her visit was part of a broader push by the administration to rebuild bridges between the two nations and open more lines of high-level communication with the nation's's , in particular with China's new economic leaders. In a press conference capping her visit, [0] described her visit as a mission to revive engagement between the two nations and said [0] believes her visit has brought the two nations ties closer to a \"surer footing.\"", "": ""}, "Economic philosophy": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] is widely considered to be a \"dove\" on monetary policy (i.e., more concerned with unemployment than with inflation) and, as such, generally favors lower rather than higher Federal Reserve interest rates. [0] was overall in favor of more stringent financial regulation to lessen systemic risks brought on by flaws in the financial system. [0] was arguably the most liberal Federal Reserve leader since Marriner S. Eccles, who was appointed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt amidst the Great Depression in 1934. On fiscal policy, publications frequently refer to [0] as \"sort of\" a deficit hawk. [0] expressed concern about the United States fiscal path prior to the COVID-19 recession, particularly about the national debt; in 2018, [0] said, \"If [0] had a magic wand, [0] would raise taxes and cut retirement spending.\" The following year, [0] again suggested that [0] favored both raising revenue and making changes to the Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security programs to control spending. In September 2021, at a House Financial Services Committee hearing, [0] lent support to efforts for the complete removal of the debt ceiling, arguing that the debt ceiling is \"very destructive\" and poses an unnecessary threat to the American economy.In January 2019, [0] was among the 45 original signers of the Economists' Statement on Carbon Dividends, which was eventually signed by over 3,500 prominent American economists promoting a carbon dividends framework for the U.S. policy on climate change. In October 2020, the Group of Thirty's Steering Committee Working Group on Climate Change and Finance, which [0] co-chaired with Mark Carney, prepared a report that developed a robust and inclusive strategy to amplify and mainstream the global transition to a net-zero emissions economy. a report that developed a robust and inclusive strategy to amplify and mainstream the global transition to a net-zero emissions economy calls upon governments, businesses, and financial institutions to assess climate risks and supports a phase-in of carbon pricing to accelerate a shift to carbon neutrality.[0] is a Keynesian economist and has been described as a \"Keynesian to [0]'s fingertips\". In\u00a0April\u00a01999, [0] discussed [0]'s views on the application of Keynesian economics to policymaking at\u00a0the Yale\u00a0economics\u00a0department reunion. [0] stated that while most economists \"appreciate the value of markets and incentives,\" Yalies \"can recognize when \" Yalies \" are not operating correctly and have higher concern for policies to remedy \" Yalies \".\" During the financial crisis of a decade ago, [0] \"warned against an over-hasty removal of stimulus,\" and \"believes United States has a duty to tackle poverty and inequality.\" When [0]'s appointment as treasury secretary was announced, [0] was viewed by House Financial Services Committee as a \"treasury secretary who will push hard for expansionary policies aimed at boosting growth, profits and share prices,\" although the ability of [0] to push through [0]'s preferred fiscal policies was seen as likely to be constrained by congressional gridlock."}, "Honors and awards": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on.
