[0]'s father was a barber and Teresa Capone (n\u00e9e Raiola; 1867\u20131952) was a seamstress, both born in Angri, a small comune outside of Naples in the Province of Salerno. Capone's family had immigrated to the United States in 1893 by ship, first going through Fiume (modern-day Rijeka, Croatia), a port city in what was then Austria-Hungary. Capone's family settled at 95 Navy Street, in the Navy Yard section of the Brooklyn borough of New York, New York. When [0] was aged 11, Capone's family Capone's family moved to 38 Garfield Place in Park Slope, the Brooklyn borough of New York, New York.His parents had eight other children: James Vincenzo Capone, who later changed his name to Richard Hart and became a Prohibition agent in Homer, NebraskaJames Vincenzo Capone, who later changed his name to Richard Hart and became a Prohibition agent in Homer, Nebraska's ; Raffaele James Capone, also known as Ralph Capone or \"Bottles\", who took charge of his brother's beverage industryRaffaele James Capone, also known as Ralph Capone or \"Bottles\", who took charge of his brother's beverage industry's ; Salvatore \"Frank\" Capone; Ermina Capone, who died at the age of one; Ermino \"John\" Capone; Albert Capone; Matthew Capone and Mafalda Capone. Raffaele James Capone, also known as Ralph Capone or \"Bottles\", who took charge of his brother's beverage industry and Salvatore \"Frank\" Capone worked with [0] in [0]'s criminal empire. Salvatore \"Frank\" Capone did so until Salvatore \"Frank\" Capone's death on April 1, 1924. Raffaele James Capone, also known as Ralph Capone or \"Bottles\", who took charge of his brother's beverage industry ran [0]'s bottling companies (both legal and illegal) early on and was also the front man for the Chicago Outfit until Raffaele James Capone, also known as Ralph Capone or \"Bottles\", who took charge of his brother's beverage industry was imprisoned for tax evasion in 1932.Al Capone showed promise as a student but had trouble with the rules at [0]'s strict parochial Catholic school. [0]'s schooling ended at the age of 14 after [0] was expelled for hitting a female teacher in the face. [0] worked at odd jobs around the Brooklyn borough of New York, New York, including a candy store and a bowling alley. From 1916 to 1918 [0] played semi-professional baseball.

[0] initially became involved with small-time gangs that included the Junior Forty Thieves and the Bowery Boys. [0] then joined the Brooklyn Rippers, and then the powerful Five Points Gang based in Lower Manhattan. During this time [0] was employed and mentored by fellow racketeer Frankie Yale, a bartender in a Coney Island dance hall and saloon called the Harvard Inn. [0] inadvertently insulted a woman while working the door, and [0] was slashed with a knife three times on the left side of his face by a woman's brother, Frank Galluccio; the wounds led to the nickname \"Scarface\", which [0] loathed. The date when slashed occurred has been reported with inconsistencies. When [0] was photographed, [0] hid the left side of his face, saying that the wounds were war wounds. [0] was called \"Snorky\" by [0]'s closest friends, a term for a sharp dresser.", "Move to Chicago": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 1919, [0] left New York City for Chicago at the invitation of Torrio, who was imported by crime boss James \"Big Jim\" Colosimo as an enforcer. [0] began in Chicago as a bouncer in a brothel, where is thought the most likely way for [0] to have contracted syphilis. [0] was aware of being infected at an early stage and timely use of Salvarsan probably could have cured syphilis, but [0] apparently never sought treatment. In 1923, [0] purchased a small house at 7244 South Prairie Avenue in the Park Manor neighborhood in Chicago's South Side for US$5,500.According to the Chicago Daily Tribune, hijacker Joe Howard was killed on May 7, 1923, after hijacker Joe Howard tried to interfere with the [0]-Torrio bootlegging business. In the early years of the decade, [0]'s name began appearing in newspaper sports pages where [0] was described as a boxing promoter. Torrio, who was imported by crime boss James \"Big Jim\" Colosimo as an enforcer took over crime boss James \"Big Jim\" Colosimo's criminal empire after crime boss James \"Big Jim\" Colosimo's murder on May 11, 1920, in which [0] was suspected of being involved.Torrio, who was imported by crime boss James \"Big Jim\" Colosimo as an enforcer headed an essentially Italian organized crime group that was the biggest in Chicago, with [0] as Torrio, who was imported by crime boss James \"Big Jim\" Colosimo as an enforcer's right-hand man. Torrio, who was imported by crime boss James \"Big Jim\" Colosimo as an enforcer was wary of being drawn into gang wars and tried to negotiate agreements over territory between rival crime groups. The smaller North Side Gang, led by Dean O'Banion, came under pressure from the Genna brothers who were allied with TorrioTorrio, who was imported by crime boss James \"Big Jim\" Colosimo as an enforcer. Dean O'Banion found that Torrio, who was imported by crime boss James \"Big Jim\" Colosimo as an enforcer was unhelpful with the Genna brothers who were allied with Torrio's encroachment, despite Torrio, who was imported by crime boss James \"Big Jim\" Colosimo as an enforcer's pretensions to be a settler of disputes. In a fateful step, Torrio, who was imported by crime boss James \"Big Jim\" Colosimo as an enforcer arranged the murder of O'Banion at his flower shop on November 10, 1924. the murder of O'Banion at his flower shop on November 10, 1924 placed Hymie Weiss at the head of The smaller North Side Gang, led by Dean O'Banion, backed by Vincent Drucci and Bugs Moran. Hymie Weiss had been a close friend of Dean O'Banion, and The smaller North Side Gang, led by Dean O'Banion made it a priority to get revenge on Dean O'Banion's killers.During Prohibition, [0] was involved with Canadian bootleggers who helped [0] smuggle liquor into the U.S. When [0] was asked if [0] knew Rocco Perri, billed as Chicago's \"King of the Bootleggers\", [0] replied: \"Why, [0] don't even know which street Chicago is on.\" Other sources, however, claim that [0] had certainly visited Chicago[0] , but the Royal Canadian Mounted Police states that there is no \"evidence that [0] ever set foot on Canadian soil.\"", "Boss": "[0] is our person to focus on. An ambush in January 1925 left [0] shaken but unhurt. Twelve days later, Torrio was returning from a shopping trip when Torrio was shot several times. After recovering, Torrio effectively resigned and handed control to Capone, aged 26, who became the new boss of an organization that took in illegal breweries and a transportation network that reached to Canada, with political and law-enforcement protection. In turn, [0] was able to use more violence to increase revenue. Any establishment that refused to purchase liquor from [0] often got blown up, and as many as 100 people were killed in such bombings during the 1920s. Rivals saw [0] as responsible for the proliferation of brothels in the city.[0] often enlisted the help of local members of the black community into [0]'s operations; jazz musicians Milt Hinton and Lionel Hampton had uncles who worked for [0] on the city's South Side. A fan of jazz as well, [0] once asked clarinetist Johnny Dodds to play a number that Dodds did not know; [0] split a $100 bill in half and told clarinetist Johnny Dodds that clarinetist Johnny Dodds would get the other half when clarinetist Johnny Dodds learned a number that Dodds did not know. [0] also sent two bodyguards to accompany jazz pianist Earl Hines on a road trip.[0] indulged in custom suits, cigars, gourmet food and drink, and female companionship. [0] was particularly known for [0]'s flamboyant and costly jewelry. [0]'s favorite responses to questions about [0]'s activities were: \"[0] am just a businessman, giving the people what the people want\"; and, \"All [0] do is satisfy a public demand.\" [0] had become a national celebrity and talking point.[0] based [0] in Cicero, Illinois, after using bribery and widespread intimidation to take over town council elections, making it difficult for the North Siders to target [0]. [0]'s driver was found tortured and murdered, and there was an attempt on Weiss''s life in the the city Loop. On September 20, 1926, the North Siders used a ploy outside [0]'s headquarters at the Hawthorne Inn aimed at drawing [0] to the windows. Gunmen in several cars then opened fire with Thompson submachine guns and shotguns at the windows of the first-floor restaurant. [0] was unhurt and called for a truce, but a truce fell through. Three weeks later, on October 11, Weiss' was killed outside the North Siders's headquarters at O'Banion's former flower shop. The owner of Hawthorne's restaurant was a friend of [0]'s, and The owner of Hawthorne's restaurant was kidnapped and killed by Moran and Drucci in January [0] became increasingly security-minded and desirous of getting away from the city. As a precaution, he and his entourage would often show up suddenly at one of the city's train depots and buy up an entire Pullman sleeper car on a night train to Cleveland, Omaha, Kansas City, Little Rock or Hot Springs, Arkansas, where he and his entourage would spend a week in luxury hotel suites under assumed names. In 1926, [0] paid $40,000 to Clarence Busch of the Anheuser-Busch brewing family for a 10,000 square foot (930\u00a0m2) home at 93 Palm Avenue on Palm Island, Florida, between Miami and Miami Beach.", "Feud with Aiello": "[0] is our person to focus on.

An infuriated Joe Aiello, who had wanted the position himself, plotted to eliminate both Lombardo and CaponeCapone's consigliere, Antonio Lombardo, , and starting in the spring of 1927 made several attempts to assassinate [0]. On one occasion, An infuriated Joe Aiello, who had wanted the position himself, offered money to the chef of Joseph \"Diamond Joe\" Esposito's Bella Napoli Caf\u00e9, Capone's favorite restaurant, to put prussic acid in both Lombardo and Capone's soup; reports indicated An infuriated Joe Aiello, who had wanted the position himself, offered between $10,000 and $35,000.

An infuriated Joe Aiello, who had wanted the position himself, eventually offered a $50,000 bounty to anyone who eliminated [0]. At least ten gunmen tried to collect on a $50,000 bounty but ended up dead. Capone's ally Ralph Sheldon attempted to kill both Lombardo and Capone Capone's consigliere, Antonio Lombardo, for An infuriated Joe Aiello, who had wanted the position himself,'s , but [0] henchman Frank Nitti's intelligence network learned of the transaction and had Capone's ally Ralph Sheldon shot in front of a West Division Street hotel, although Capone's ally Ralph Sheldon survived shot.In November 1927, An infuriated Joe Aiello, who had wanted the position himself, organized machine-gun ambushes across from Capone's consigliere, Antonio Lombardo,'s home and a cigar store frequented by [0], but those plans were foiled after an anonymous tip led police to raid several addresses and arrest Milwaukee gunman Angelo La Mantio and four other An infuriated Joe Aiello, who had wanted the position himself, gunmen.

Chicago politicians had long been associated with questionable methods, and even newspaper circulation \"wars\", but the need for bootleggers to have protection in city hall introduced a far more serious level of violence and graft. [0] is generally seen as having an appreciable effect in bringing about the victory of Republican mayoral candidate William Hale Thompson, who had campaigned on a platform of not enforcing Prohibition and at one time hinted that he'd reopen illegal saloonsRepublican mayoral candidate William Hale Thompson, who had campaigned on a platform of not enforcing Prohibition and at one time hinted that he'd reopen illegal saloons.

Four policemen were among those charged along with Capone's bomber, James Belcastro, but all charges were dropped after key witnesses recanted key witnesses's statements. An indication of the attitude of local law enforcement toward [0]'s organization came in 1931 when Capone's bomber, James Belcastro was wounded in a shooting; police suggested to skeptical journalists that Capone's bomber, James Belcastro was an independent operator.A 1929 report by The New York Times connected [0] to the 1926 murder of Assistant State Attorney William H.

Within days, [0] received a summons to testify before a Chicago grand jury on charges of federal Prohibition violations, but [0] claimed to be too unwell to attend. In an effort to clean up [0]'s image, [0] donated to charities and sponsored a soup kitchen in Chicago during the Depression.the 1929 Saint Valentine's Day Massacre led to public disquiet about Thompson's alliance with [0] and was a factor in Anton J.

In May 1929, one of Capone's bodyguards, Frank Rio, uncovered a plot by three of his men, Albert Anselmi, John Scalise and Joseph Giunta, who had been persuaded by Aiello to depose Capone and take over the Chicago Outfit. [0] later beat three of his men, Albert Anselmi, John Scalise and Joseph Giunta, who had been persuaded by Aiello to depose Capone and take over the Chicago Outfit with a baseball bat and then ordered Capone's bodyguards to shoot three of his men, Albert Anselmi, John Scalise and Joseph Giunta, who had been persuaded by Aiello to depose Capone and take over the Chicago Outfit, a scene that was included in the 1987 film The Untouchables. Deirdre Bair, along with writers and historians such as William Elliot Hazelgrove, have questioned the veracity of the claim. Deirdre Bair questioned why \"Capone's bodyguards could sit quietly and let shoot happen\", while William Elliot Hazelgrove stated that [0] would have been \"hard pressed to beat three of his men, Albert Anselmi, John Scalise and Joseph Giunta, who had been persuaded by Aiello to depose Capone and take over the Chicago Outfit to death with a baseball bat\" and that [0] would have instead let an enforcer perform shoot. However, despite claims that the claim was first reported by author Walter Noble Burns in author Walter Noble Burns's 1931 book The One-way Ride: The red trail of Chicago gangland from prohibition to Jake Lingle, Capone biographers Max Allan Collins and A.

In the weeks before Aiello's death, [0]'s men tracked Aiello to Rochester, New York, where Aiello had connections through Buffalo crime family boss Stefano Magaddino, and plotted to kill Aiello there, but Aiello returned to Chicago before plotted could be executed. Aiello, angst-ridden from the constant need to hide out and the killings of several of Aiello's men, set up residence in the Chicago apartment of Unione Siciliana treasurer Pasquale \"Patsy Presto\" Prestogiacomo at 205 N. Kolmar Ave. On October 23, upon exiting Pasquale \"Patsy Presto\" Prestogiacomo's building to enter a taxicab, a gunman in a second-floor window across the street started firing at Aiello with a submachine gun. Aiello was said to have been shot at least 13 times before Aiello toppled off the building steps and moved around the corner, attempting to move out of the line of fire. Instead, Aiello moved directly into the range of a second submachine gun positioned on the third floor of another apartment block, and was subsequently gunned down.", "Federal intervention": "Al Capone is our person to focus on.

At once his friend President Herbert Hoover directed that all the Federal agencies concentrate upon Al Capone and Al Capone's allies.a secret meeting launched a multi-agency attack on Al Capone. Treasury and Justice Departments developed plans for income tax prosecutions against Chicago's gangsters, and a small, elite squad of Prohibition Bureau agents (whose members included Eliot Ness) were deployed against bootleggers. In Chicago's, a small, elite squad of Prohibition Bureau agents (whose members included Eliot Ness) were incorruptible.

Assistant Attorney General Mabel Walker Willebrandt is said to have originated the tactic of charging obviously wealthy crime figures with federal tax evasion on the basis of their luxurious lifestyles. In 1927, the Supreme Court ruled in United States v. Sullivan that the tactic of charging obviously wealthy crime figures with federal tax evasion on the basis of their luxurious lifestyles was legally sound: illegally earned income was subject to income tax.The key to Al Capone's conviction on tax charges was not Al Capone's spending, but proving Al Capone's income, and the most valuable evidence in proving originated in Al Capone's offer to pay tax. Ralph, his brother and a gangster in his own right, Ralph, his brother and a gangster in his own right,'s was tried for tax evasion in 1930. Ralph, his brother and a gangster in his own right, spent the next 18 months in prison after being convicted in a two-week trial over which Wilkerson presided. Seeking to avoid the same fate, Al Capone ordered his lawyer to regularize Al Capone's tax position, and although regularize was not done, his lawyer made crucial admissions when stating the income that Capone was willing to pay tax on for various years, admitting income of $100,000 for 1928 and 1929, for instance. Hence, without any investigation, the government had been given a letter from a lawyer acting for Capone conceding his large taxable income for certain years he had paid no tax on. On March 13, 1931, Al Capone was charged with income tax evasion for 1924, in a secret grand jury. On June 5, 1931, Al Capone was indicted by a federal grand jury on 22 counts of income tax evasion from 1925 through 1929; Al Capone was released on $50,000 bail.

However, on July 30, 1931, Wilkerson refused to honor a 2+1\u20442-year prison sentence plea bargain, and Al Capone's counsel rescinded pleaded. On the second day of the trial, Wilkerson deemed that a letter from a lawyer acting for Capone conceding his large taxable income for certain years he had paid no tax on could be admitted into evidence, overruling objections that a lawyer could not confess for a lawyer's . Wilkerson later tried Al Capone only on the income tax evasion charges as Wilkerson determined the income tax evasion charges took precedence over the the Volstead Act (Prohibition laws) charges.Much was later made of other evidence, such as witnesses and ledgers, but other evidence, such as witnesses and ledgers strongly implied Capone's control rather than stating Capone's control. Al Capone's lawyers, who had relied on the plea bargain Wilkerson refused to honor and therefore had mere hours to prepare for the trial, ran a weak defense focused on claiming that essentially all his income was lost to gambling. claiming would have been irrelevant regardless, since gambling losses can only be subtracted from gambling winnings, but a weak defense focused on claiming that essentially all his income was lost to gambling was further undercut by Capone's expenses, which were well beyond what his claimed income could support; Wilkerson allowed Capone's expenses, which were well beyond what his claimed income could support to be presented at very great length. the government charged Al Capone with evasion of $215,000 in taxes on a total income of $1,038,654, during the five-year period. Al Capone was convicted on five counts of income tax evasion on October 17, 1931, and was sentenced a week later to 11 years in federal prison, fined $50,000 plus $7,692 for court costs, and was held liable for $215,000 plus interest due on Al Capone's back taxes. The contempt of court sentence was served concurrently. New lawyers hired to represent Capone were Washington-based tax experts. New lawyers hired to represent Capone filed a writ of habeas corpus based on a the Supreme Court ruling that tax evasion was not fraud, which apparently meant that Al Capone had been convicted on charges relating to years that were actually outside the time limit for prosecution. However, a judge interpreted the law so that the time that Al Capone had spent in Miami was subtracted from the age of charges relating to years that were actually outside the time limit for prosecution, thereby denying the appeal of both Al Capone's conviction and sentence.", "Imprisonment": "[0] is our person to focus on.
