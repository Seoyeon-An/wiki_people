His 1893 work, The Scream, has become one of Western art's most acclaimed images.[0]'s childhood was overshadowed by illness, bereavement and the dread of inheriting a mental condition that ran in the family. Studying at the Royal School of Art and Design in Kristiania (today's Oslo), [0] began to live a bohemian life under the influence of the nihilist Hans J\u00e6ger, who urged [0] to paint [0]'s own emotional and psychological state ('soul painting'); from paint emerged [0]'s distinctive style.Travel brought new influences and outlets. In Paris, [0] learned much from Paul Gauguin, Vincent van Gogh and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, especially Paul Gauguin, Vincent van Gogh and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec's use of color. In Berlin, [0] met the Swedish dramatist August Strindberg, whom [0] painted, as [0] embarked on a major series of paintings [0] would later call The Frieze of Life, depicting a series of deeply-felt themes such as love, anxiety, jealousy and betrayal, steeped in atmosphere.His 1893 work, The Scream, was conceived in Kristiania. According to [0], [0] was out walking at sunset, when [0] 'heard the enormous, infinite scream of nature'. His 1893 work, The Scream,'s agonized face is widely identified with the angst of the modern person. Between 1893 and 1910, [0] made two painted versions and two in pastels, as well as a number of prints. One of pastels would eventually command the fourth highest nominal price paid for a painting at auction.As [0]'s fame and wealth grew, [0]'s emotional state remained insecure. [0] briefly considered marriage, but could not commit [0]. A mental breakdown in 1908 forced [0] to give up heavy drinking, and [0] was cheered by [0]'s increasing acceptance by the people of Kristiania and exposure in Kristiania's museums. [0]'s later years were spent working in peace and privacy. Although his works were banned in Nazi-occupied Europe, most of his works survived World War II, securing [0] a legacy."}, "Life": {"Childhood": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was born in a farmhouse in the village of \u00c5dalsbruk in L\u00f8ten, Norway, to Laura Catherine Bj\u00f8lstad and Christian Munch, the son of a priest. Christian Munch, the son of a priest was a doctor and medical officer who married Laura Catherine Bj\u00f8lstad Christian Munch, the son of a priest's in 1861. [0] had an elder sister, Johanne Sophie, and three younger siblings: Peter Andreas, Laura Catherine, and Inger Marie. Laura Catherine was artistically talented and may have encouraged [0] and an elder sister, Johanne Sophie. [0] was related to the painter Jacob Munch and the historian Peter Andreas Munch.The family moved to Oslo (then called Christiania and renamed to Kristiania in 1877) in 1864 when Christian Munch, the son of a priest was appointed medical officer at Akershus Fortress. Laura Catherine died of tuberculosis in 1868, as did an elder sister, Johanne Sophie in 1877. After Laura Catherine's , their were raised by Christian Munch, the son of a priest and by their aunt Karen. Often ill for much of the winters and kept out of school, [0] would draw to keep [0] occupied. [0] was tutored by [0]'s school mates and their aunt Karen. Christian Munch, the son of a priest also instructed Christian Munch, the son of a priest's in history and literature, and entertained their with vivid ghost-stories and the tales of the American writer Edgar Allan Poe.As [0] remembered it, Christian Munch, the son of a priest's positive behavior towards Christian Munch, the son of a priest's was overshadowed by Christian Munch, the son of a priest's morbid pietism. [0] wrote, \"Christian Munch, the son of a priest was temperamentally nervous and obsessively religious\u2014to the point of psychoneurosis. From Christian Munch, the son of a priest [0] inherited the seeds of madness. The angels of fear, sorrow, and death stood by [0]'s side since the day [0] was born.\" Christian Munch, the son of a priest reprimanded Christian Munch, the son of a priest's by telling their that Laura Catherine was looking down from heaven and grieving over their's misbehavior. The oppressive religious milieu, [0]'s poor health, and the vivid ghost stories helped inspire [0]'s macabre visions and nightmares; [0] felt that death was constantly advancing on [0]. Laura Catherine was diagnosed with mental illness at an early age. Of the five siblings, Peter Andreas married, but Peter Andreas died a few months after married. [0] would later write, \"[0] inherited two of mankind's most frightful enemies\u2014the heritage of consumption and insanity.Christian Munch, the son of a priest's military pay was very low, and Christian Munch, the son of a priest's attempts to develop a private side practice failed, keeping Christian Munch, the son of a priest's in genteel but perennial poverty. The family moved frequently from one cheap flat to another. [0]'s early drawings and watercolors depicted these interiors, and the individual objects, such as medicine bottles and drawing implements, plus some landscapes. By [0]'s teens, art dominated [0]'s interests. At 13, [0] had [0]'s first exposure to other artists at the newly formed Art Association, where [0] admired the work of the Norwegian landscape school. [0] returned to copy the work of the Norwegian landscape school, and soon [0] began to paint in oils.", "Mental health": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] had severe mental health difficulties during [0]'s lifetime. [0] is believed to have had Borderline Personality Disorder, a mental health disorder characterized by fear of abandonment, chronic feelings of emptiness, impulsive behavior, and various other symptoms. [0] also displayed alcoholism, a trait often associated with impulsivity in Borderline Personality Disorder, a mental health disorder characterized by fear of abandonment, chronic feelings of emptiness, impulsive behavior, and various other symptoms.", "Studies and influences": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 1879, [0] enrolled in a technical college to study engineering, where [0] excelled in physics, chemistry and mathematics. [0] learned scaled and perspective drawing, but frequent illnesses interrupted [0]'s studies. The following year, much to his father's's disappointment, [0] left a technical college determined to become a painter. his father's viewed art as an \"unholy trade\", and his father's's neighbors reacted bitterly and sent his father's anonymous letters. In contrast to his father's's rabid pietism, [0] adopted an undogmatic stance towards art. [0] wrote [0]'s goal in [0]'s diary: \"In [0]'s art [0] attempt to explain life and life's meaning to [0].\"In 1881, [0] enrolled at the Royal School of Art and Design of Kristiania, one of whose founders was his distant relative Jacob Munch. [0]'s teachers were the sculptor Julius Middelthun and the naturalistic painter Christian Krohg. 1881, [0] demonstrated [0]'s quick absorption of [0]'s figure training at the Royal School of Art and Design of Kristiania, one of whose founders was his distant relative Jacob Munch in [0]'s first portraits, including one of his father and [0]'s first self-portrait. In 1883, [0] took part in [0]'s first public exhibition and shared a studio with other students. His full-length portrait of Karl Jensen-Hjell, a notorious bohemian-about-town, earned a critic's dismissive response: \"His full-length portrait of Karl Jensen-Hjell, a notorious bohemian-about-town, is impressionism carried to the extreme. His full-length portrait of Karl Jensen-Hjell, a notorious bohemian-about-town, is a travesty of art.\" Munch's nude paintings from this period survive only in sketches, except for Standing Nude (1887). Munch's nude paintings from this period may have been confiscated by his father's.Impressionism inspired [0] from a young age.  During these early years, [0] experimented with many styles, including Naturalism and Impressionism. Some early works are reminiscent of Manet. Many of experimented brought [0] unfavorable criticism from the press and garnered [0] constant rebukes by his father's. At one point, however, his father's, perhaps swayed by the negative opinion of [0]'s cousin Edvard Diriks (an established, traditional painter), destroyed at least one painting (likely a nude) and refused to advance any more money for art supplies.[0] also received his father's's ire for [0]'s relationship with Hans J\u00e6ger, the local nihilist who lived by the code \"a passion to destroy is also a creative passion\" and who advocated suicide as the ultimate way to freedom. [0] came under his father's's malevolent, anti-establishment spell. \"My ideas developed under the influence of the bohemians or rather under his father's. Many people have mistakenly claimed that My ideas were formed under the influence of Strindberg and the Germans ... but claimed is wrong. My ideas had already been formed by then.\" At that time, contrary to many of the other bohemians, [0] was still respectful of women, as well as reserved and well-mannered, but [0] began to give in to the binge drinking and brawling of [0]'s circle. [0] was unsettled by the sexual revolution going on at the time and by the independent women around [0]. [0] later turned cynical concerning sexual matters, expressed not only in [0]'s behavior and [0]'s art, but in [0]'s writings as well, an example being a long poem called The City of Free Love. Still dependent on [0]'s family for many of [0]'s meals, [0]'s relationship with his father's remained tense over concerns about [0]'s bohemian life.After numerous experiments, [0] concluded that the Impressionist idiom did not allow sufficient expression. [0] found the Impressionist idiom superficial and too akin to scientific experimentation. [0] felt a need to go deeper and explore situations brimming with emotional content and expressive energy. Under his father's's commandment that [0] should \"write [0]'s life\", meaning that [0] should explore [0]'s own emotional and psychological state, [0] began a period of reflection and self-examination, recording [0]'s thoughts in [0]'s \"soul's diary\". This deeper perspective helped move [0] to a new view of [0]'s art. [0] wrote that his painting The Sick Child (1886), based on his sister's death, was [0]'s first \"soul painting\", [0]'s first break from Impressionism. his painting The Sick Child (1886), based on his sister's death received a negative response from critics and from [0]'s family, and caused another \"violent outburst of moral indignation\" from the community.Only [0]'s friend Christian Krohg defended [0]:[0] paints, or rather regards, things in a way that is different from that of other artists. [0] sees only the essential, and only the essential, naturally, is all [0] paints. For this reason Munch's pictures are as a rule \"not complete\", as people are so delighted to discover for people. Oh, yes, Munch's pictures are complete. [0]'s complete handiwork. Art is complete once [0] has really said everything that was on [0]'s mind, and this is precisely the advantage [0] has over painters of the other generation, that [0] really knows how to show us what [0] has felt, and what has gripped [0], and to show [0] subordinates everything else. [0] continued to employ a variety of brushstroke techniques and color palettes throughout the 1880s and early 1890s, as [0] struggled to define [0]'s style. [0]'s idiom continued to veer between naturalistic, as seen in one of his father, and impressionistic, as in Rue Lafayette. [0]'s Inger on the Beach (1889), which caused another storm of confusion and controversy, hints at the simplified forms, heavy outlines, sharp contrasts, and emotional content of [0]'s mature style to come. [0] began to carefully calculate [0]'s compositions to create tension and emotion. While stylistically influenced by the Post-Impressionists, what evolved was a subject matter which was symbolist in content, depicting a state of mind rather than an external reality. In 1889, [0] presented his first one-man show of nearly all his works to date. The recognition his first one-man show of nearly all his works to date received led to a two-year state scholarship to study in Paris under French painter L\u00e9on Bonnat.[0] seems to have been an early critic of photography as an art form, and remarked that photography as an art form \"will never compete with the brush and the palette, until such time as photographs can be taken in Heaven or Hell!\"Munch's younger sister Laura was the subject of his 1899 interior Melancholy: Laura. Amanda O'Neill says of his 1899 interior Melancholy: Laura, \"In this heated claustrophobic scene [0] not only portrays Hell!\"Munch's younger sister Laura's tragedy, but [0]'s own dread of the madness [0] might have inherited.\"", "Paris": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] arrived in Paris during the festivities of the Exposition Universelle (1889) and roomed with two fellow Norwegian artists. [0]'s picture Morning (1884) was displayed at the Norwegian pavilion. [0] spent [0]'s mornings at Bonnat's's busy studio (which included female models) and afternoons at the exhibition, galleries, and museums (where students were expected to make copies as a way of learning technique and observation). [0] recorded little enthusiasm for Bonnat's's drawing lessons\u2014\"It tires and bores [0]\u2014it's numbing\"\u2014but enjoyed Bonnat's's commentary during museum trips.[0] was enthralled by the vast display of modern European art, including the works of three artists who would prove influential: Paul Gauguin, Vincent van Gogh, and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec\u2014all notable for how three artists who would prove influential: Paul Gauguin, Vincent van Gogh, and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec used color to convey emotion. [0] was particularly inspired by Paul Gauguin's \"reaction against realism\" and Paul Gauguin's credo that \"art was human work and not an imitation of Nature\", a belief earlier stated by Whistler. As one of [0]'s Berlin friends said later of [0], \"[0] need not make [0]'s way to Tahiti to see and experience the primitive in human nature. [0] carries [0]'s own Tahiti within [0].\" Influenced by Paul Gauguin, as well as the etchings of German artist Max Klinger, [0] experimented with prints as a medium to create graphic versions of [0]'s works. In 1896 [0] created [0]'s first woodcuts\u2014a medium that proved ideal to [0]'s symbolic imagery. Together with [0]'s contemporary Nikolai Astrup, [0] is considered an innovator of the woodcut medium in Norway.In December 1889 his father died, leaving Munch's family destitute. [0] returned home and arranged a large loan from a wealthy Norwegian collector when wealthy relatives failed to help, and assumed financial responsibility for Munch's family from then on. his father's depressed [0] and [0] was plagued by suicidal thoughts: \"[0] live with the dead\u2014[0]'s mother, [0]'s sister, [0]'s grandfather, his father...Kill yourself and then live's over. Why live?\" [0]'s paintings of the following year included sketchy tavern scenes and a series of bright cityscapes in which [0] experimented with the pointillist style of Georges Seurat.", "Berlin": "[0] is our person to focus on. By 1892, [0] formulated [0]'s characteristic, and original, Synthetist style, as seen in Melancholy (1891), in which color is the symbol-laden element. Considered by the artist and journalist Christian Krohg as the first Symbolist painting by a Norwegian artist, Melancholy (1891), in which color is the symbol-laden element was exhibited in 1891 at the Autumn Exhibition in Oslo. In 1892, Adelsteen Normann, on behalf of the Union of Berlin Artists, invited [0] to exhibit at its November exhibition, the society's first one-man exhibition. However, his paintings evoked bitter controversy (dubbed \"The [0] Affair\"), and after one week its November exhibition, the society's first one-man exhibition closed. [0] was pleased with the \"great commotion\", and wrote in a letter: \"Never have [0] had such an amusing time\u2014it's incredible that something as innocent as painting should have created such a stir.\"In Berlin, [0] became involved in an international circle of writers, artists and critics, including the Swedish dramatist and leading intellectual August Strindberg, whom [0] painted in 1892. [0] also met Danish writer and painter Holger Drachmann, whom he painted in 1898. Danish writer and painter Holger Drachmann, whom he painted in 1898 was 17 years [0]'s senior and a drinking companion at Zum schwarzen Ferkel (At the Black Piglet) in 1893\u201394. In 1894 Danish writer and painter Holger Drachmann, whom he painted in 1898 wrote of [0]: \"[0] struggles hard. Good luck with [0]'s struggles, [0].\"During [0]'s four years in Berlin, [0] sketched out most of the ideas that would be comprised in [0]'s major work, The Frieze of Life, first designed for book illustration but later expressed in paintings. [0] sold little, but made some income from charging entrance fees to view his paintings. Already, [0] was showing a reluctance to part with [0]'s paintings, which [0] termed [0]'s \"children\".[0]'s other paintings, including casino scenes, show a simplification of form and detail which marked [0]'s early mature style. [0] also began to favor a shallow pictorial space and a minimal backdrop for his frontal figures. Since poses were chosen to produce the most convincing images of states of mind and psychological conditions, as in Ashes, his frontal figures impart a monumental, static quality. [0]'s figures appear to play roles on a theatre stage (Death in the Sick-Room), whose pantomime of fixed postures signify various emotions; since each character embodies a single psychological dimension, as in The Scream, [0]'s men and women began to appear more symbolic than realistic. [0] wrote, \"No longer should interiors be painted, people reading and women knitting: there would be living people, breathing and feeling, suffering and loving.\"", "The Scream": "Edvard Munch is our person to focus on. The Scream exists in four versions: two pastels (1893 and 1895) and two paintings (1893 and 1910). There are also several lithographs of The Scream (1895 and later).The 1895 pastel sold at auction on 2 May 2012 for US$119,922,500, including commission. later).The 1895 pastel is the most colorful of four versions: two pastels (1893 and 1895) and two paintings (1893 and 1910) and is distinctive for the downward-looking stance of one of later).The 1895 pastel's background figures. later).The 1895 pastel is also the only version not held by a Norwegian museum.The 1893 version was stolen from the National Gallery in Oslo in 1994 and was recovered. 1910 was stolen in 2004 from the Munch Museum in Oslo, but recovered in 2006 with limited damage.The Scream is Edvard Munch's most famous work, and one of the most recognizable paintings in all art. The Scream has been widely interpreted as representing the universal anxiety of modern man. Painted with broad bands of garish color and highly simplified forms, and employing a high viewpoint, The Scream reduces the agonized figure to a garbed skull in the throes of an emotional crisis.With The Scream, Edvard Munch met Edvard Munch's stated goal of \"the study of the soul, that is to say the study of Edvard Munch's own self\". Edvard Munch wrote of how The Scream came to be: \"Edvard Munch was walking down the road with two friends when the sun set; suddenly, the sky turned as red as blood. Edvard Munch stopped and leaned against the fence, feeling unspeakably tired. Tongues of fire and blood stretched over the bluish black fjord. two friends went on walking, while Edvard Munch lagged behind, shivering with fear. Then Edvard Munch heard the enormous, infinite scream of nature.\" Edvard Munch later described the personal anguish behind The Scream, \"for several years Edvard Munch was almost mad... You know Edvard Munch's picture, 'The Scream?' Edvard Munch was stretched to the limit\u2014nature was screaming in Edvard Munch's blood... After that Edvard Munch gave up hope ever of being able to love again.\"In 2003, comparing The Scream with other great works, art historian Martha Tedeschi wrote:Whistler's Mother, Wood's American Gothic, Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa and Edvard Munch's have all achieved something that most paintings\u2014regardless of most paintings's art historical importance, beauty, or monetary value\u2014have not: most paintings communicate a specific meaning almost immediately to almost every viewer. most paintings have successfully made the transition from the elite realm of the museum visitor to the enormous venue of popular culture. ", "Frieze of Life\u2014A Poem about Life, Love and Death": "[0] is our person to focus on. In December 1893, Unter den Linden in Berlin was the location of an exhibition of [0]'s work, showing, among other pieces, six paintings entitled Study for a Series: Love. six paintings entitled Study for a Series: Love began a cycle he later called the Frieze of Life\u2014A Poem about Life, Love and Death. Frieze of Life motifs, such as The Storm and Moonlight, are steeped in atmosphere. Other motifs illuminate the nocturnal side of love, such as Rose and Amelie and Love and Pain. In Death in the Sickroom, the subject is the death of [0]'s sister Sophie, which [0] re-worked in many future variations. The dramatic focus of Death in the Sickroom, portraying [0]'s entire family, is dispersed in the separate and disconnected figures of sorrow. In 1894, [0] enlarged the spectrum of motifs by adding Anxiety, Ashes, Madonna and Women in Three Stages (from innocence to old age).Around the start of the 20th century, [0] worked to finish a cycle he later called the Frieze of Life\u2014A Poem about Life, Love and Death. [0] painted a number of pictures, several of a number of pictures in bigger format and to some extent featuring the Art Nouveau aesthetics of the time. [0] made a wooden frame with carved reliefs for the large painting Metabolism (1898), initially called Adam and Eve. the large painting Metabolism (1898), initially called Adam and Eve reveals [0]'s pre-occupation with the \"fall of man\" and [0]'s pessimistic philosophy of love. Motifs such as The Empty Cross and Golgotha (both c.\u20091900) reflect a metaphysical orientation, and also reflect [0]'s pietistic upbringing. a cycle he later called the Frieze of Life\u2014A Poem about Life, Love and Death was shown for the first time at the secessionist exhibition in Berlin in 1902.\"The Frieze of Life\" themes recur throughout [0]'s work but [0] especially focused on 1902.\"The Frieze of Life\" themes in the mid-1890s. In sketches, paintings, pastels and prints, [0] tapped the depths of [0]'s feelings to examine [0]'s major motifs: the stages of life, the femme fatale, the hopelessness of love, anxiety, infidelity, jealousy, sexual humiliation, and separation in life and death. These themes are expressed in paintings such as The Sick Child (1885), Love and Pain (retitled Vampire; 1893\u201394), Ashes (1894), and The Bridge. The Bridge shows limp figures with featureless or hidden faces, over which loom the threatening shapes of heavy trees and brooding houses. [0] portrayed women either as frail, innocent sufferers (see Puberty and Love and Pain) or as the cause of great longing, jealousy and despair (see Separation, Jealousy, and Ashes).Munch often uses shadows and rings of color around [0]'s figures to emphasize an aura of fear, menace, anxiety, or sexual intensity. These paintings have been interpreted as reflections of [0]'s sexual anxieties, though it could also be argued that These paintings represent [0]'s turbulent relationship with love itself love itself and [0]'s general pessimism regarding human existence. Many of These paintings were done in several versions, such as Madonna, Hands and Puberty, and also transcribed as wood-block prints and lithographs. [0] hated to part with his paintings because [0] thought of his paintings as a single body of expression. So to capitalize on [0]'s production and make some income, [0] turned to graphic arts to reproduce many of [0]'s paintings, including those in this series. [0] admitted to the personal goals of his paintings but [0] also offered his paintings to a wider purpose, \"his paintings is really a voluntary confession and an attempt to explain to [0] [0]'s relationship with life\u2014his paintings is, therefore, actually a sort of egoism, but [0] am constantly hoping that through his paintings [0] can help others achieve clarity.\"While attracting strongly negative reactions, in the 1890s [0] began to receive some understanding of [0]'s artistic goals, as one critic wrote, \"With ruthless contempt for form, clarity, elegance, wholeness, and realism, [0] paints with intuitive strength of talent the most subtle visions of the soul.\" One of [0]'s great supporters in Berlin was Walther Rathenau, later the German foreign minister, who strongly contributed to [0]'s success.", "Landscapes and Nature": "[0] is our person to focus on. Despite over half of [0]'s painted works being landscapes, [0] is rarely seen as a landscape artist. However, [0] had a fixation on several elements of nature that resulted in recurrent motifs throughout his work. The shoreline and the forest are both significant settings of his work. A focus on [0]'s use of nature to convey emotion is the topic of [0]: Trembling Earth at the Clark Art Institute.", "Paris, Berlin and Kristiania": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 1896, [0] moved to Paris, where [0] focused on graphic representations of [0]'s Frieze of Life themes. [0] further developed [0]'s woodcut and lithographic technique. [0]'s Self-Portrait with Skeleton Arm (1895) is done with an etching needle-and-ink method also used by Paul Klee. [0] also produced multi-colored versions of The Sick Child, concerning tuberculosis, which sold well, as well as several nudes and multiple versions of Kiss (1892). In May 1896, Siegfried Bing held an exhibition of Munch's work inside Siegfried Bing's Maison de l'Art Nouveau. an exhibition of Munch's work displayed 60 works, including Kiss, The Scream, Madonna, The Sick Child, The Death Chamber, and The Day After. an exhibition of Munch's work helped to introduce [0] to a French audience. Still, many of the Parisian critics still considered Munch's work \"violent and brutal\" even if [0]'s exhibitions received serious attention and good attendance. [0]'s financial situation improved considerably and, in 1897, [0] bought [0] a summer house facing the fjords of Kristiania, a small fisherman's cabin built in the late 18th century, in the small town of \u00c5sg\u00e5rdstrand in Norway. [0] dubbed a summer house facing the fjords of Kristiania, a small fisherman's cabin built in the late 18th century, in the small town of \u00c5sg\u00e5rdstrand in Norway the \"Happy House\" and returned here almost every summer for the next 20 years. It was this place [0] missed when [0] was abroad and when [0] felt depressed and exhausted. \"To walk in the small town of \u00c5sg\u00e5rdstrand in Norway is like walking among [0]'s paintings\u2014[0] get so inspired to paint when [0] am here\".In 1897 [0] returned to Kristiania[0] \u2014one critic wrote, \"A fair number of these pictures have been exhibited before. In one critic's opinion these pictures improve on acquaintance.\" In 1899, [0] began an intimate relationship with Tulla Larsen, a \"liberated\" upper-class woman. They traveled to Italy together and upon returning, [0] began another fertile period in [0]'s art, which included landscapes and [0]'s final painting in \"The Frieze of Life\" series, The Dance of Life (1899). Tulla Larsen, a \"liberated\" upper-class woman was eager for marriage, but [0] was not. [0]'s drinking and poor health reinforced [0]'s fears, as [0] wrote in the third person: \"Ever since [0] was a child [0] had hated marriage. [0]'s sick and nervous home had given [0] the feeling that [0] had no right to get married.\" [0] almost gave in to Tulla Larsen, a \"liberated\" upper-class woman, but fled from Tulla Larsen, a \"liberated\" upper-class woman in 1900, also turning away from Tulla Larsen, a \"liberated\" upper-class woman's considerable fortune, and moved to Berlin. [0]'s Girls on the Jetty[clarification needed], created in 18 different versions, demonstrated the theme of feminine youth without negative connotations. In 1902, [0] displayed [0]'s works thematically at the hall of the Berlin Secession, producing \"a symphonic effect\u2014displayed made a great stir\u2014a lot of antagonism\u2014and a lot of approval.\" The Berlin critics were beginning to appreciate Munch's work even though the public still found Munch's work alien and strange.The good press coverage gained [0] the attention of influential patrons Albert Kollman and Max Linde. [0] described the turn of events in [0]'s diary, \"After 20 years of struggle and misery forces of good finally come to [0]'s aid in Germany\u2014and a bright door opens up for [0].\" However, despite this positive change, [0]'s self-destructive and erratic behavior led [0] first to a violent quarrel with another artist, then to an accidental shooting in the presence of Tulla Larsen, who had returned for a brief reconciliation, which injured two of his fingers. [0] later sawed a self-portrait depicting [0] and Tulla Larsen, a \"liberated\" upper-class woman in half as a consequence of an accidental shooting in the presence of Tulla Larsen, who had returned for a brief reconciliation, which injured two of his fingers and subsequent events. Tulla Larsen, a \"liberated\" upper-class woman finally left [0] and married a younger colleague of [0]. [0] took married as a betrayal, and [0] dwelled on the humiliation for some time to come, channeling some of the bitterness into new paintings. [0]'s paintings Still Life (The Murderess) and The Death of Marat I, done in 1906\u201307, clearly reference an accidental shooting in the presence of Tulla Larsen, who had returned for a brief reconciliation, which injured two of his fingers and the emotional after-effects.In 1903\u201304, [0] exhibited in Paris where the coming Fauvists, famous for their boldly false colors, the coming Fauvists, famous for their boldly false colors,'s likely saw his works and might have found inspiration in his works. When the coming Fauvists, famous for their boldly false colors, held the coming Fauvists, famous for their boldly false colors,'s own exhibit in 1906\u201307, [0] was invited and displayed his works with the coming Fauvists, famous for their boldly false colors,. After studying the sculpture of Rodin, [0] may have experimented with plasticine as an aid to design, but [0] produced little sculpture. During this time, [0] received many commissions for portraits and prints which improved [0]'s usually precarious financial condition. In 1906\u201307, [0] painted the screen for an Ibsen play in the small Kammerspiele Theatre located in Berlin's Deutsches Theater, in which the Frieze of Life was hung. The theatre's director Max Reinhardt later sold the Frieze of Life; the Frieze of Life is now in the Berlin Nationalgalerie.
