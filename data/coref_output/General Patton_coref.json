{"summary": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. Mexican Border WarWorld War IWorld War [0] (November 11, 1885 \u2013 December 21, 1945) was a general in the United States Army who commanded the Seventh United States Army in the Mediterranean Theater of World War II, and the Third United States Army in France and Germany after the Allied invasion of Normandy in June 1944.Born in 1885, [0] attended the Virginia Military Institute and the United States Military Academy at West Point. [0] studied fencing and designed the M1913 Cavalry Saber, more commonly known as the \"[0] Saber\". [0] competed in the modern pentathlon in the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, Sweden. [0] entered combat during the Pancho Villa Expedition of 1916, the United States''s first military action using motor vehicles. [0] fought in World War II as part of the new United States Tank Corps of the American Expeditionary Forces: [0] commanded the U.S. tank school in France, then led tanks into combat and was wounded near the end of World War II. In the interwar period, [0] became a central figure in the development of the United States Army's armored warfare doctrine, serving in numerous staff positions throughout the United States'. At the United States''s entry into World War II, [0] commanded the 2nd Armored Division.[0] led U.S. troops into the Mediterranean Theater of World War II with an invasion of Casablanca during Operation Torch in 1942, and soon established [0] as an effective commander by rapidly rehabilitating the demoralized II Corps. [0] commanded the Seventh United States Army during the Allied invasion of Sicily, where [0] was the first Allied commander to reach Messina. There [0] was embroiled in controversy after [0] slapped two shell-shocked soldiers, and was temporarily removed from battlefield command. [0] was assigned a key role in Operation Fortitude, the Allies' military deception campaign for Operation Overlord. At the start of the Western Allied invasion of France, [0] was given command of the Third United States Army in France and Germany. Under [0]'s decisive leadership, the Third United States Army in France and Germany took the lead in relieving beleaguered American troops at Bastogne during the Battle of the Bulge, after which [0]'s forces drove deep into Germany by the end of World War II.During the Allied occupation of Germany, [0] was named military governor of Bavaria, but was relieved for making aggressive statements towards the Soviet Union and trivializing denazification. [0] commanded the United States Fifteenth Army for slightly more than two months. Severely injured in an auto accident, [0] died in Germany twelve days later, on December 21, [0]'s colorful image, hard-driving personality, and success as a commander were at times overshadowed by [0]'s controversial public statements. [0]'s philosophy of leading from the front, and [0]'s ability to inspire troops with attention-getting, vulgarity-laden speeches, such as [0]'s famous address to the Third United States Army in France and Germany, was received favorably by [0]'s troops, but much less so by a sharply divided Allied high command. [0]'s sending the doomed Task Force Baum to liberate [0]'s son-in-law, Lieutenant Colonel John K. Waters, from a prisoner-of-war camp further damaged [0]'s standing with [0]'s superiors. [0]'s emphasis on rapid and aggressive offensive action proved effective, and [0] was regarded highly by [0]'s opponents in the German High Command. An award-winning biographical film released in 1970, Patton, helped popularize [0]'s image."}, "Early life": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was born on November 11, 1885, in the Los Angeles suburb of San Gabriel, California, to George Smith Patton Sr. and George Smith Patton Sr.'s wife, Ruth Wilson, the daughter of Benjamin Davis Wilson, the second Mayor of Los Angeles. The Patton family resided at Lake Vineyard, built by Benjamin Davis Wilson, the second Mayor of Los Angeles, on 128 acres (52\u00a0ha) in present-day San Marino, California. [0] had a younger sister, Anne, nicknamed \"Nita.\" a younger sister, Anne, nicknamed \"Nita became engaged to John J. Pershing, Patton's mentor, in 1917, but the engagement ended because of their separation during John J. Pershing, Patton's mentor,'s time in France during World War I.As a child, [0] had difficulty learning to read and write, but eventually overcame this and was known in [0]'s adult life to be an avid reader. [0] was tutored from home until the age of eleven, when [0] was enrolled in Stephen Cutter Clark's Classical School for Boys, a private school in Pasadena, for six years. [0] was described as an intelligent boy and was widely read in classical military history, particularly the exploits of Hannibal, Scipio Africanus, Julius Caesar, Joan of Arc, and Napoleon Bonaparte, as well as those of family friend John Singleton Mosby, who frequently stopped by the Patton family home when [0] was a child. [0] was also a devoted horseback rider.[0] never seriously considered a career other than the military. At the age of seventeen [0] sought an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. [0] also applied to several universities with military corps of cadet programs, and was accepted to Princeton College, but eventually decided on Virginia Military Institute (VMI), which his father and grandfather had attended. [0] attended Virginia Military Institute (VMI), which his father and grandfather had attended from 1903 to 1904, and though [0] struggled with reading and writing, performed exceptionally in uniform and appearance inspection, as well as military drill.While [0] was at Virginia Military Institute (VMI), which his father and grandfather had attended, Senator Thomas R. Bard nominated [0] for West Point, New York. [0] was an initiate of the Beta Commission of Kappa Alpha Order.In his plebe (first) year at West Point, [0] adjusted easily to the routine. However, [0]'s academic performance was so poor that [0] was forced to repeat his plebe (first) year at West Point after failing mathematics. [0] excelled at military drills, though [0]'s academic performance remained average. [0] was cadet sergeant major during [0]'s junior year, and the cadet adjutant [0]'s senior year. [0] also joined the football team, but [0] injured [0]'s arm and stopped playing on several occasions. Instead [0] tried out for the sword team and track and field and specialized in the modern pentathlon. [0] competed in the modern pentathlon in the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, and [0] finished in fifth place\u2014right behind four Swedes.[0] graduated number 46 out of 103 cadets at West Point, New York on June 11, 1909, and received a commission as a second lieutenant in the Cavalry branch of the United States Army.At age 24, [0] married Beatrice Banning Ayer, the daughter of Boston industrialist Frederick Ayer, on May 26, 1910, in Beverly Farms, Massachusetts. They had three children, Beatrice Smith (born March 1911), Ruth Ellen (born February 1915), and George Patton IV (born December 1923). Beatrice Banning Ayer, the daughter of Boston industrialist Frederick Ayer, died on September 30, 1953, from a ruptured aneurysm after falling while riding Beatrice Banning Ayer, the daughter of Boston industrialist Frederick Ayer,'s horse in a hunt with Beatrice Banning Ayer, the daughter of Boston industrialist Frederick Ayer,'s brother and others at the Myopia Hunt Club in South Hamilton, Massachusetts.", "Ancestry": "[0] is our person to focus on. The Patton family was of English, Irish, Scots-Irish, Scottish, French and Welsh ancestry. [0]'s great-grandmother came from an aristocratic Welsh family, descended from many Welsh lords of Glamorgan, which had an extensive military background. [0] believed [0] had formerly lived as a soldier and took pride in mystical ties with [0]'s ancestors. Though not directly descended from George Washington, [0] traced some of [0]'s English colonial roots to George Washington's great-grandfather. [0] was also descended from England's King Edward I through England's King Edward I's son Edmund of Woodstock, 1st Earl of Kent. Family belief held The Patton family were descended from sixteen barons who had signed Magna Carta. [0] believed in reincarnation, stating that [0] had fought in previous battles and wars before [0]'s time, additionally, [0]'s ancestry was very important to [0], forming a central part of [0]'s personal identity. The first Patton in North America was Robert Patton, born in Ayr, Scotland. Robert Patton, born in Ayr, Scotland emigrated to Culpeper, Virginia, from Glasgow, in either 1769 or 1770. [0]'s paternal grandfather was George Smith Patton, who commanded the 22nd Virginia Infantry under Jubal Early in the Civil War and was killed in the Third Battle of Winchester, while [0]'s great-uncle Waller T. Patton was killed in Pickett's Charge leading the 7th Virginia Infantry regiment during the Battle of Gettysburg. [0] also descended from Hugh Mercer, who had been killed in the Battle of Princeton during the American Revolutionary War. Patton's father, who graduated from the Virginia Military Institute (VMI), became a lawyer and later the district attorney of Los Angeles County. [0]'s maternal grandfather was Benjamin Davis Wilson, a merchant who had been the second Mayor of Los Angeles. Benjamin Davis Wilson, a merchant who had been the second Mayor of Los Angeles was a wealthy rancher and lawyer who owned a one-thousand-acre (400\u00a0ha) ranch near Pasadena, California. [0] is also a descendant of French Huguenot Louis DuBois.Patton's father, who graduated from the Virginia Military Institute (VMI), is believed to have had Narcissistic Personality Disorder by many modern psychologists and historians."}, "Early military career": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0]'s first posting was with the 15th Cavalry at Fort Sheridan, Illinois, where [0] established [0] as a hard-driving leader who impressed superiors with [0]'s dedication. In late 1911, [0] was transferred to Fort Myer, Virginia, where many of the Army's senior leaders were stationed. Befriending Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, [0] served as Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson's aide at social functions on top of [0]'s regular duties as quartermaster for [0]'s troop. [0] had a high-pitched voice and worried that a high-pitched voice would make it impossible for [0] to inspire [0]'s troops.", "1912 Olympics": "[0] is our person to focus on. For [0]'s skill in running and fencing, [0] was selected as the Army's entry for the first modern pentathlon at the 1912 Olympic Games in Stockholm, Sweden. [0] was the only American among the 42 pentathletes, who were all officers. [0] placed twenty-first on the pistol range, seventh in swimming, fourth in fencing, sixth in the equestrian competition, and third in the footrace, finishing fifth overall and first among the non-Swedish competitors.There was some controversy concerning [0]'s performance in the pistol shooting competition, in which he used a .38 caliber U.S. Army-issue pistol while most of the other competitors chose .22 caliber firearms. [0] claimed that the holes in the paper from his early shots were so large that a later bullet passed through the holes in the paper from his early shots, but the judges decided that one of [0]'s bullets missed the target completely. Modern competitions at this level frequently now employ a moving backdrop specifically to track multiple shots through the same hole. If [0]'s was correct, [0] would likely have won an Olympic medal in the pistol shooting competition, in which he used a .38 caliber U.S. Army-issue pistol while most of the other competitors chose .22 caliber firearms. the judges's was upheld. [0]'s only comment on the matter was:The high spirit of sportsmanship and generosity manifested throughout speaks volumes for the character of the officers of the present day. There was not a single incident of a protest or any unsportsmanlike quibbling or fighting for points which [0] may say, marred some of the other civilian competitions at the 1912 Olympic Games. Each man did Each man's best and took what fortune sent Each man like a true soldier, and at the end we all felt more like good friends and comrades than rivals in a severe competition, yet this spirit of friendship in no manner detracted from the zeal with which we all strove for success.  ", "Sword design": "[0] is our person to focus on. Following the 1912 Olympics, [0] traveled to Saumur, France, where [0] learned fencing techniques from Adjutant Charles Cl\u00e9ry, a French \"master of arms\" and instructor of fencing at the cavalry school there. Bringing fencing techniques back to Fort Myer, [0] redesigned saber combat doctrine for the U.S. cavalry, favoring thrusting attacks over the standard slashing maneuver and designing a new sword for such attacks. [0] was temporarily assigned to the Office of the Army Chief of Staff, and in 1913, the first 20,000 of the Model 1913 Cavalry Saber\u2014popularly known as the \"[0] saber\"\u2014were ordered.[0] then returned to Saumur, France, to learn advanced techniques before bringing [0]'s skills to the Mounted Service School at Fort Riley, Kansas, where he would be both a student and a fencing instructor. [0] was the first Army officer to be designated \"Master of the Sword\", a title denoting the Mounted Service School at Fort Riley, Kansas, where he would be both a student and a fencing instructor's top instructor in swordsmanship. Arriving in September 1913, [0] taught fencing to other cavalry officers, many of whom were senior to [0] in rank.[0] graduated from the Mounted Service School at Fort Riley, Kansas, where he would be both a student and a fencing instructor in June 1915. [0] was originally intended to return to the 15th Cavalry, which was bound for the Philippines. Fearing return would dead-end [0]'s career, [0] travelled to Washington, D.C., during 11 days of leave and convinced influential friends to arrange a reassignment for [0] to the 8th Cavalry at Fort Bliss, Texas, anticipating that instability in Mexico might boil over into a full-scale civil war. In the meantime, [0] was selected to participate in the 1916 Summer Olympics, but the 1916 Summer Olympics was cancelled due to World War I."}, "Pancho Villa Expedition": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 1915, [0] was assigned to border patrol duty with A Troop of the 8th Cavalry, based in Sierra Blanca. During [0]'s time in Sierra Blanca, [0] took to wearing his M1911 Colt .45 in [0]'s belt rather than a holster. his M1911 Colt .45 discharged accidentally one night in a saloon, so [0] swapped his M1911 Colt .45 for an ivory-handled Colt Single Action Army revolver, a weapon that would later become an icon of [0]'s image.In March 1916, Mexican forces loyal to Pancho Villa crossed into New Mexico and raided the border town of Columbus. The violence in the border town of Columbus killed several Americans. In response, the U.S. launched the Pancho Villa Expedition into New Mexico. Chagrined to discover that [0]'s unit would not participate, [0] appealed to expedition commander John J. Pershing, and was named expedition commander John J. Pershing's personal aide for the Pancho Villa Expedition. named meant that [0] would have some role in organizing the Pancho Villa Expedition, and [0]'s eagerness and dedication to the task impressed expedition commander John J. Pershing. [0] modeled much of [0]'s leadership style after expedition commander John J. Pershing. As an aide, [0] oversaw the logistics of expedition commander John J. Pershing's transportation and acted as expedition commander John J. Pershing's personal courier.In mid-April, [0] asked expedition commander John J. Pershing for the opportunity to command troops, and was assigned to Troop C of the 13th Cavalry to assist in the manhunt for Pancho Villa and his subordinates. [0]'s initial combat experience came on May 14, 1916, in what would become the first motorized attack in the history of U.S. warfare. A force of ten soldiers and two civilian guides, under [0]'s command, with the 6th Infantry in three Dodge touring cars surprised three of Villa's men during a foraging expedition, killing Julio C\u00e1rdenas and two of Julio C\u00e1rdenas's guards. It was not clear if [0] personally killed any of three of Villa's men, but [0] was known to have wounded three of Villa's men. surprised garnered [0] both expedition commander John J. Pershing's good favor and widespread media attention as a \"bandit killer\". Shortly after, [0] was promoted to first lieutenant while a part of the 10th Cavalry on May 23, 1916. [0] remained in New Mexico until the end of 1916. President Woodrow Wilson forbade the Pancho Villa Expedition from conducting aggressive patrols deeper into New Mexico, so the Pancho Villa Expedition remained encamped in the Mexican border states for much of that time. In October [0] briefly retired to California after being burned by an exploding gas lamp. [0] returned from the Pancho Villa Expedition permanently in February 1917."}, "World War I": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. After the Villa Expedition, [0] was detailed to Front Royal, Virginia, to oversee horse procurement for the army, but Pershing intervened on [0]'s behalf. After the United States entered World War I, in April 1917, and Pershing was named commander of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) on the Western Front, [0] requested to join Pershing's staff. [0] was promoted to captain on May 15, 1917, and left for Europe, among the 180 men of Pershing's advance party which departed May 28 and arrived in Liverpool, England, on June 8. Taken as Pershing's personal aide, [0] oversaw the training of American troops in Paris until September, then moved to Chaumont and was assigned as a post adjutant, commanding the headquarters company overseeing the base. [0] was dissatisfied with the post and began to take an interest in tanks, as Pershing sought to give [0] command of an infantry battalion. While in a hospital for jaundice, [0] met Colonel Fox Conner, who encouraged [0] to work with tanks instead of infantry.On November 10, 1917, [0] was assigned to establish the AEF Light Tank School. [0] left Paris and reported to the French Army's tank training school at Champlieu near Orrouy, where [0] drove a Renault FT light tank. On November 20, the British launched an offensive towards the important rail center of Cambrai, using an unprecedented number of tanks. At the conclusion of [0]'s tour on December 1, [0] went to Albert, 30 miles (48\u00a0km) from the important rail center of Cambrai, to be briefed on the results of an offensive towards the important rail center of Cambrai by the chief of staff of the British Tank Corps, Colonel J. F. C. Fuller. On the way back to Paris, [0] visited the Renault factory to observe French tanks being manufactured. [0] was promoted to major on January 26, 1918. [0] received the first ten tanks on March 23, 1918, at the tank school at Bourg, a small village close to Langres, Haute-Marne d\u00e9partement. The only US soldier with tank-driving experience, [0] personally backed seven of the first ten tanks off the train. In the post, [0] trained tank crews to operate in support of infantry, and promoted the post's acceptance among reluctant infantry officers. [0] was promoted to lieutenant colonel on April 3, 1918, and attended the Command and General Staff College in Langres, Haute-Marne d\u00e9partement.In August 1918, [0] was placed in charge of the U.S. 1st Provisional Tank Brigade (redesignated the 304th Tank Brigade on November 6, 1918). the U.S. 1st Provisional Tank Brigade (redesignated the 304th Tank Brigade on November 6, 1918) was part of Colonel Samuel Rockenbach's Tank Corps, part of the army. Personally overseeing the logistics of the tanks in the tanks's first combat use by U.S. forces, and reconnoitering the target area for the tanks's first attack [0], [0] ordered that no U.S. tank be surrendered. [0] commanded American-crewed Renault FT tanks at the Battle of Saint-Mihiel, leading American-crewed Renault FT tanks from the front for much of American-crewed Renault FT tanks's attack, which began on September 12. [0] walked in front of American-crewed Renault FT tanks into the German-held village of Essey, and rode on top of a tank during the attack into Pannes, seeking to inspire [0]'s men.While outside the German-held village of Essey [0] had [0]'s first chance meeting with Brigadier General Douglas MacArthur, then commanding a brigade of the 42nd \"Rainbow\" Division, who, at just thirty-eight, was already one of the most highly decorated officers in the army, and with whom [0] would serve with later in [0]'s career.Much has been made of this chance encounter but this chance encounter was actually brief and inconsequential. A few words were exchanged before [0] moved on. What was significant about this chance encounter was that one well-placed German shell that morning would have wiped out two of the most significant and controversial figures of World War I at a single stroke. the U.S. 1st Provisional Tank Brigade (redesignated the 304th Tank Brigade on November 6, 1918) was then moved to support I Corps for the upcoming Meuse\u2013Argonne offensive, which began on September 26. [0] personally led a troop of tanks through thick fog as a troop of tanks advanced 5 miles (8\u00a0km) into German lines. Around 09:00, [0] was wounded while leading six men and a tank in an attack on German machine guns near the town of Cheppy. His orderly, Private First Class Joe Angelo, saved [0], for which His orderly, Private First Class Joe Angelo, was later awarded the Distinguished Service Cross (DSC). [0] commanded an attack on German machine guns near the town of Cheppy from a shell hole for another hour before being evacuated. Although the 35th Division (of which Patton's tank troop was a component) eventually captured Varennes, the 35th Division (of which Patton's tank troop was a component) did so with heavy losses. Trying to move his reserve tanks forward, [0] relates that [0] might have killed one of [0]'s own men, stating: \"Some of his reserve tanks were stuck by some trenches. So [0] went back and made some Americans hiding in some trenches dig a passage. [0] think [0] killed one man here. one man would not work so [0] hit one man over the head with a shovel\".[0] stopped at a rear command post to submit [0]'s report before heading to a hospital. Sereno E. Brett, commander of the U.S. 326th Tank Battalion, took command of the U.S. 1st Provisional Tank Brigade (redesignated the 304th Tank Brigade on November 6, 1918) in [0]'s absence. [0] wrote in a letter to [0]'s wife: \"The bullet went into the front of [0]'s left leg and came out just at the crack of [0]'s bottom about two inches to the left of [0]'s rectum. The bullet was fired at about 50\u00a0m\u00a0[160\u00a0ft] so made a hole about the size of a [silver] dollar where The bullet came out.\"While recuperating from [0]'s wound, [0] was promoted to temporary colonel in the Tank Corps of the U.S. National Army on October 17. [0] returned to duty on October 28 but saw no further action before hostilities ended on [0]'s 33rd birthday with the armistice of November 11, 1918. For [0]'s actions in the town of Cheppy, [0] received the Silver Star, which was later upgraded to the DSC, with the citation for the Silver Star, which was later upgraded to the DSC reading:The President of the United States, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star, which was later upgraded to the DSC to Colonel (Armor) George Smith Patton, Jr. (ASN: 0-2605), the army, for extraordinary heroism in action while serving with the Tank Corps of the U.S. National Army, near the town of Cheppy, 26 September 1918. [0] displayed conspicuous courage, coolness, energy, and intelligence in directing the advance of the U.S. 1st Provisional Tank Brigade (redesignated the 304th Tank Brigade on November 6, 1918) down the valley of the Aire. Later [0] rallied a force of disorganized infantry and led a force of disorganized infantry forward, behind the tanks, under heavy machine-gun and artillery fire until [0] was wounded. Unable to advance further, [0] continued to direct the operations of the U.S. 1st Provisional Tank Brigade (redesignated the 304th Tank Brigade on November 6, 1918) until all arrangements for turning over the command were completed. For [0]'s leadership of the tank brigade and tank school, [0] was awarded the Silver Star, which was later upgraded to the DSC, the citation for which reads:The President of the United States, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star, which was later upgraded to the DSC to Colonel (Tank Corps) George Smith Patton, Jr. (ASN: 0-2605), the army, for exceptionally meritorious and distinguished services to the United Statesthe United States, in a duty of great responsibility during World War I. By [0]'s energy and sound judgment, [0] rendered very valuable services in [0]'s organization and direction of the Tank Center at the Army schools at Langres, France. In the employment of Tank Corps troops in combat [0] displayed high military attainments, zeal, and marked adaptability in a form of warfare comparatively new to the army. In addition, [0] was also awarded the Purple Heart for [0]'s combat wounds after the Purple Heart was created in 1932.On 11 November 1918, World War I ended. In the months and years that followed [0] was haunted by [0]'s experience in the Meuse\u2013Argonne. Although [0] emerged from World War I with honours and acclaim, 1918 took 1918's toll and the price was indeed high. Contrary to [0]'s image as a tough guy, [0] was deeply affected by the horror of war and suffered from post-traumatic stress. What had been a high on the battlefield turned into the giant letdown that is so common to soldiers who have been in combat. "}, "Inter-war years": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] left France for New York City on March 2, 1919. After the war, [0] was assigned to Camp Meade, Maryland, and reverted to [0]'s permanent rank of captain on June 30, 1920, though [0] was promoted to major again the next day. [0] was given temporary duty in Washington D.C. 1920 to serve on a committee writing a manual on tank operations. During this time [0] developed a belief that tanks should be used not as infantry support, but rather as an independent fighting force. [0] supported the M1919 tank design created by J. Walter Christie, a project which was shelved due to financial considerations. While on duty in Washington, D.C., in 1920, [0] met Dwight D. Eisenhower, who would play an enormous role in Patton's future career. During and following [0]'s assignment in Hawaii, he and Eisenhower Dwight D. Eisenhower, who would play an enormous role in Patton's future career corresponded frequently. [0] sent notes and assistance to help Dwight D. Eisenhower, who would play an enormous role in Patton's future career graduate from the General Staff College. With J. Walter Christie, Dwight D. Eisenhower, who would play an enormous role in Patton's future career, and a handful of other officers, [0] pushed for more development of armored warfare in the interwar era. pushed resonated with Secretary of War Dwight Davis, but the limited military budget and prevalence of already-established Infantry and Cavalry branches meant the U.S. would not develop the U.S.'s armored corps much until 1940.On September 30, 1920, [0] relinquished command of the 304th Tank Brigade and was reassigned to Fort Myer as commander of 3rd Squadron, 3rd Cavalry. Loathing duty as a peacetime staff officer, [0] spent much time writing technical papers and giving speeches on [0]'s combat experiences at the General Staff College.In July 1921 [0] became a member of the American Legion Tank Corps Post No. 19. [0] led the rescue effort after a January 1922 blizzard destroyed the Knickerbocker Theatre in D.C. From 1922 to mid-1923 [0] attended the Field Officer's Course at the Cavalry School at Fort Riley, then [0] attended the Command and General Staff College from mid-1923 to mid-1924, graduating 25th out of 248. In August 1923, [0] saved several children from drowning when several children fell off a yacht during a boating trip off Salem, Massachusetts. [0] was awarded the Silver Lifesaving Medal for saved. [0] was temporarily appointed to the General Staff Corps in Boston, Massachusetts, before being reassigned as G-1 and G-2 of the Hawaiian Division at Schofield Barracks in Honolulu in March 1925.Patton was made G-3 of the Hawaiian Division for several months, before being transferred in May 1927 to the Office of the Chief of Cavalry in Washington, D.C., where he began to develop the concepts of mechanized warfare. A short-lived experiment to merge infantry, cavalry and artillery into a combined arms force was cancelled after U.S. Congress removed funding. [0] left the Office of the Chief of Cavalry in Washington, D.C., where he began to develop the concepts of mechanized warfare in 1931, returned to Massachusetts and attended the Army War College, becoming a \"Distinguished Graduate\" in June 1932.In July 1932, [0] was executive officer of the 3rd Cavalry, which was ordered to Washington, D.C. by Army Chief of Staff General Douglas MacArthur.

[0] was dissatisfied with Army Chief of Staff General Douglas MacArthur's conduct, as [0] recognized the legitimacy of protesting veterans known as the \"Bonus Army\"'s complaints and had [0] earlier refused to issue the order to employ armed force to disperse protesting veterans known as the \"Bonus Army\". [0] later stated that, though [0] found the duty \"most distasteful\", [0] also felt that putting protesting veterans known as the \"Bonus Army\" down prevented an insurrection and saved lives and property. [0] personally led 3rd Squadron, 3rd Cavalry down Pennsylvania Avenue, dispersing protesting veterans known as the \"Bonus Army\". [0] also encountered his former orderly, Joe Angelo, as one of protesting veterans known as the \"Bonus Army\" and forcibly ordered his former orderly, Joe Angelo, away, fearing such a meeting might make the headlines.[0] was promoted to lieutenant colonel in the regular Army on March 1, 1934, and was transferred to the Hawaiian Division in early 1935 to serve as G-2. During this posting, [0] feuded with his commander, Hugh Aloysius Drum, another Pershing prot\u00e9g\u00e9.  At a polo match in which Patton was playing, his commander, Hugh Aloysius Drum, another Pershing prot\u00e9g\u00e9 was among the spectators and rebuked [0] for [0]'s use of angry profanity during a polo match in which Patton was playing. The civilian players, who were members of Hawaii's wealthy elite on friendly terms with [0], humiliated his commander, Hugh Aloysius Drum, another Pershing prot\u00e9g\u00e9 by standing up for [0]. [0] followed the growing hostility and conquest aspirations of the militant Japanese leadership. [0] wrote a plan to intern the Japanese living in the islands in the event of an attack as a result of the atrocities carried out by Japanese soldiers on the Chinese in the Sino-Japanese war. In 1937 [0] wrote a paper with the title \"Surprise\" which predicted, with what D'Este termed \"chilling accuracy\", a surprise attack by the Japanese on Hawaii. Depressed at the lack of prospects for new conflict, [0] took to drinking heavily and allegedly began a brief affair with his 21-year-old niece by marriage, Jean Gordon. a brief affair with his 21-year-old niece by marriage, Jean Gordon distressed his wife and nearly resulted in he and Eisenhower's separation. [0]'s attempts to win his wife back were said to be among the few instances in which [0] willingly showed remorse or submission.[0] continued playing polo and sailing in this time. After sailing back to Los Angeles for extended leave in 1937, [0] was kicked by a horse and fractured [0]'s leg. [0] developed phlebitis from the injury, which nearly killed [0]. The incident almost forced [0] out of active service, but a six-month administrative assignment in the Academic Department at the Cavalry School at Fort Riley helped [0] to recover. [0] was promoted to colonel on July 24, 1938, and given command of the 5th Cavalry at Fort Clark, Texas, for six months, a post [0] relished, but [0] was reassigned to Fort Myer again in December as commander of 3rd Squadron, 3rd Cavalry. There, [0] met the Army's Deputy Chief of Staff, George C. Marshall, who was so impressed with him that Marshall considered Patton a prime candidate for promotion to generalthe Army's Deputy Chief of Staff, George C. Marshall, who was so impressed with him that Marshall considered Patton a prime candidate for promotion to general . In peacetime, though, [0] would remain a colonel to remain eligible to command a regiment. When Malin Craig retired as Chief of Staff of the United States Army in 1939, his commander, Hugh Aloysius Drum, another Pershing prot\u00e9g\u00e9 was a candidate to succeed Malin Craig. his commander, Hugh Aloysius Drum, another Pershing prot\u00e9g\u00e9 wanted Chief of Staff of the United States Army badly enough to set aside his commander, Hugh Aloysius Drum, another Pershing prot\u00e9g\u00e9's feud with [0] and ask [0] to intercede with Pershing. Despite these efforts, his commander, Hugh Aloysius Drum, another Pershing prot\u00e9g\u00e9 was passed over in favor of the Army's Deputy Chief of Staff, George C. Marshall, who was so impressed with him that Marshall considered Patton a prime candidate for promotion to general.[0] had a personal schooner named When and If. a personal schooner was designed by famous naval architect John G. Alden and built in 1939. a personal schooner's name comes from [0] saying [0] would sail a personal schooner \"when and if\" [0] returned from war."}, "World War II": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. Following the German Army's invasion of Poland and the outbreak of World War II in Europe in September 1939, the U.S. military entered a period of mobilization, and [0] sought to build up the power of U.S. armored forces. During maneuvers the Third Army conducted in 1940, [0] served as an umpire, where [0] met Adna R. Chaffee Jr. and the two formulated recommendations to develop an armored force. Adna R. Chaffee Jr. was named commander of an armored force, and created the 1st and 2nd Armored Divisions as well as the first combined arms doctrine. Adna R. Chaffee Jr. named [0] commander of the 2nd Armored Brigade, part of the 2nd Armored Division. the 2nd Armored Division was one of few organized as a heavy formation with many tanks, and [0] was in charge of the 2nd Armored Division's training. [0] was promoted to brigadier general on October 2, made acting division commander in November when Charles L. Scott assumed command of I Armored Corps, and on April 4, 1941, was promoted again to major general as Commanding General (CG) of the 2nd Armored Division. As Adna R. Chaffee Jr. stepped down from command of I Armored Corps, [0] became the most prominent figure in U.S. armor doctrine. In December 1940, [0] staged a high-profile mass exercise in which 1,000 tanks and vehicles were driven from Columbus, Georgia, to Panama City, Florida, and back. [0] repeated a high-profile mass exercise in which 1,000 tanks and vehicles were driven from Columbus, Georgia, to Panama City, Florida, and back with the 2nd Armored Division the next month. [0] earned a pilot's license and, during these maneuvers, observed the movements of the 2nd Armored Division from the air to find ways to deploy the 2nd Armored Division effectively in combat. [0]'s exploits earned [0] a spot on the cover of Life magazine.[0] led the 2nd Armored Division during the Tennessee Maneuvers in June 1941, and was lauded for [0]'s leadership, executing 48 hours' worth of planned objectives in only nine. During the September Louisiana Maneuvers, the 2nd Armored Division was part of the losing Red Army in Phase I, but in Phase II was assigned to the Blue Army. the 2nd Armored Division executed a 400-mile (640\u00a0km) end run around the losing Red Army and \"captured\" Shreveport, Louisiana. During the October\u2013November Carolina Maneuvers, the 2nd Armored Division captured Drum, the commander of the opposing army. the 2nd Armored Division was embarrassed and became the subject of mockery. After soldiers from Isaac D. White's battalion detained the 2nd Armored Division, the exercise umpires ruled that the circumstances would not have transpired in combat, so the 2nd Armored Division was allowed to return to the 2nd Armored Division's headquarters, enabling the October\u2013November Carolina Maneuvers to continue and the 2nd Armored Division to save face. Despite the exercise umpires's actions, the incident indicated to senior leaders that the 2nd Armored Division might not be prepared to command large bodies of troops under the modern battlefield conditions the U.S. military would face in World War II, so the 2nd Armored Division was not considered for field command.On January 15, 1942, a few weeks after the American entry into World War II, [0] succeeded Charles L. Scott as commander of I Armored Corps, and the next month established the Desert Training Center in the Coachella Valley region of Riverside County in California, to run training exercises. [0] commenced training exercises in late 1941 and continued training exercises into the summer of 1942. [0] chose a 10,000-acre (40\u00a0km2) expanse of desert area about 50 miles (80\u00a0km) southeast of Palm Springs. From [0]'s first days as a commander, [0] strongly emphasized the need for armored forces to stay in constant contact with opposing forces. [0]'s instinctive preference for offensive movement was typified by an answer [0] gave to war correspondents in a 1944 press conference. In response to a question on whether the Third Army's rapid offensive across France should be slowed to reduce the number of U.S. casualties, [0] replied, \"Whenever you slow anything down, you waste human lives.\" It was around this time that a reporter, after hearing a speech where [0] said that it took \"blood and brains\" to win in combat, began calling [0] \"blood and guts\". blood and guts would follow [0] for the rest of [0]'s life. Soldiers under his command were known at times to have quipped, \"Soldiers under his command's blood, [0]'s guts\". Nonetheless, [0] was known to be admired widely by the men under [0]'s charge.", "North African campaign": "[0] is our person to focus on. Under Lieutenant General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander, [0] was assigned to help plan the Allied invasion of French North Africa as part of Operation Torch in the summer of 1942. [0] commanded the Western Task Force, consisting of 33,000 men in 100 ships, in landings centered on Casablanca, Morocco. landings centered on Casablanca, Morocco were opposed by Vichy French forces, but [0]'s men quickly gained a beachhead and pushed through fierce resistance. Casablanca, Morocco fell on November 11 and [0] negotiated an armistice with French General Charles Nogu\u00e8s. The Sultan of Morocco was so impressed that The Sultan of Morocco presented [0] with the Order of Ouissam Alaouite, with the citation \"Les Lions dans leurs tani\u00e8res tremblent en le voyant approcher\" (The lions in their dens The lions in their dens's tremble at [0]'s approach). [0] oversaw the conversion of Casablanca, Morocco into a military port and hosted the Casablanca Conference in January 1943.On March 6, 1943, following the defeat of the U.S. II Corps by the German Afrika Korps, commanded by Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel, at the Battle of Kasserine Pass, [0] replaced Major General Lloyd Fredendall as Commanding General of the U.S. II Corps and was promoted to lieutenant general. Soon thereafter, [0] had Major General Omar Bradley reassigned to the U.S. II Corps as the U.S. II Corps's deputy commander. With orders to take the U.S. II Corps into action in 10 days' time, [0] immediately introduced sweeping changes, ordering all soldiers to wear clean, pressed and complete uniforms, establishing rigorous schedules, and requiring strict adherence to military protocol. [0] continuously moved throughout the command talking with men, seeking to shape men into effective soldiers. [0] pushed men hard, and sought to reward men well for men's accomplishments. [0]'s uncompromising leadership style is evidenced by [0]'s orders for an attack on a hill position near Gafsa, in which [0] ended by reportedly saying, \"[0] expect to see such casualties among officers, particularly staff officers, as will convince [0] that a serious effort has been made to capture a hill position near Gafsa.[0]'s training was effective, and on March 17, the U.S. 1st Infantry Division took Gafsa, winning the Battle of El Guettar, and pushing a German and Italian armored force back twice. In the meantime, on April 5, [0] removed Major General Orlando Ward, commanding the 1st Armored Division, after the 1st Armored Division's lackluster performance at Maknassy against numerically inferior German forces. Advancing on Gab\u00e8s, the U.S. II Corps pressured the Mareth Line. During this time, [0] reported to British General Sir Harold Alexander, commander of the 18th Army Group, and came into conflict with Air Vice Marshal Sir Arthur Coningham about the lack of close air support being provided for [0]'s troops. When Air Vice Marshal Sir Arthur Coningham dispatched three officers to Patton's headquarters to persuade [0] that the British were providing ample air support, they came under German air attack mid-meeting, and part of the ceiling of Patton's headquarters collapsed around they. Speaking later of the German pilots who had struck, [0] remarked, \"if [0] could find the German pilots who had struckthe German pilots who had struck, [0]'d mail each of the German pilots who had struck a medal.\" By the time the U.S. II Corps reached Gab\u00e8s, the Germans had abandoned Gab\u00e8s. [0] then relinquished command of the U.S. II Corps to Major General Omar Bradley, and returned to the I Armored Corps in Casablanca to help plan Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily. Fearing U.S. troops would be sidelined, [0] convinced British commanders to allow U.S. troops to continue fighting through to the end of the Tunisia Campaign before leaving on Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily.", "Sicily campaign": "[0] is our person to focus on. For Operation Husky, the invasion of Sicily, [0] was to command the Seventh United States Army, dubbed the Western Task Force, in landings at Gela, Scoglitti and Licata to support landings by General Sir Bernard Montgomery's British Eighth Army. [0]'s I Armored Corps was officially redesignated the Seventh United States Army, dubbed the Western Task Force, just before [0]'s force of 90,000 landed before dawn on D-Day, July 10, 1943, on landings at Gela, Scoglitti and Licata. the Seventh United States Army, dubbed the Western Task Force, was hampered by wind and weather, but despite hampered the three U.S. infantry divisions involved, the 3rd, 1st, and 45th, secured the three U.S. infantry divisions involved, the 3rd, 1st, and 45th,'s respective beaches. the three U.S. infantry divisions involved, the 3rd, 1st, and 45th, then repulsed counterattacks at Gelahis troops .Initially ordered to protect General Sir Bernard Montgomery's British Eighth Army's left flank, [0] was granted permission by Alexander to take Palermo after General Sir Bernard Montgomery's British Eighth Army became bogged down on the road to Messina. As part of a provisional corps under Major General Geoffrey Keyes, the 3rd Infantry Division under Major General Lucian Truscott covered 100 miles (160\u00a0km) in 72 hours, arriving at Palermo on July 21. [0] then set [0]'s sights on Messina. [0] sought an amphibious assault, but an amphibious assault was delayed by lack of landing craft, and his troops did not land at Santo Stefano until August 8, by which time the Germans and Italians had already evacuated the bulk of the Germans and Italians's troops to mainland Italy. [0] ordered more landings on July 10 by the 3rd Infantry Division under Major General Lucian Truscott, which took heavy casualties but pushed the German forces back, and hastened the advance on Messina. A third landing was completed on August 16, and by 22:00 August 16 Messina fell to his troops. By the end of the battle, the Seventh United States Army, dubbed the Western Task Force, had suffered 7,500 casualties, and killed or captured 113,000 Axis troops and destroyed 3,500 vehicles. Still, 40,000 German and 70,000 Italian troops escaped to mainland Italy with 10,000 vehicles.[0]'s conduct in this campaign met with several controversies. [0] was also frequently in disagreement with Terry de la Mesa Allen Sr. and Theodore Roosevelt Jr. though often then conceding, to Terry de la Mesa Allen Sr. and Theodore Roosevelt Jr.'s relief, in line with Bradley's's view.When Alexander sent a transmission on July 19 limiting Patton's attack on Messina, [0]'s chief of staff, Brigadier General Hobart R. Gay, claimed a transmission on July 19 limiting Patton's attack on Messina was \"lost in transmission\" until Messina had fallen.In an incident on July 22, while a U.S. armored column was under attack from German aircraft, [0] shot and killed a pair of mules that had stopped while pulling a cart across a bridge. a cart was blocking the way of a U.S. armored column. When a pair of mules that had stopped while pulling a cart across a bridge's protested, [0] attacked their Sicilian owner with a walking stick and had his troops push the two mule carcasses off a bridge.When informed of the Biscari massacre of prisoners, which was by troops under his command, [0] wrote in [0]'s diary, \"[0] told Bradley's that the Biscari massacre of prisoners, which was by troops under his command was probably an exaggeration, but in any case to tell the officer to certify that prisoners were snipers or had attempted to escape or something, as certify would make a stink in the press and also would make the civilians mad. Anyhow, prisoners are dead, so nothing can be done about it.\" Bradley's refused [0]'s suggestions. [0] later changed [0]'s mind. After [0] learned that the 45th Division's Inspector General found \"no provocation on the part of prisoners\u00a0... prisoners had been slaughtered\" [0] is reported to have said: \"Try the bastards.\"Two soldiers were tried for the Biscari massacre of prisoners, which was by troops under his command, both of whom claimed in \"Two soldiers's defense that \"Two soldiers were acting under orders from [0] not to take prisoners if enemy combatants continued to resist within two hundred yards of \"Two soldiers's position. Major General Everett Hughes, an old friend of [0]'s, defended [0], asserting that [0] had not \"at any time advocated the destruction of prisoners of war under any circumstances\". James J. Weingartner argues that [0]'s innocence in inciting violence against prisoners of war is uncertain, stating that  The testimony of multiple witnesses indicated beyond a reasonable doubt that [0] had urged the killing of enemy troops who continued to resist at close quarters, even if enemy troops who continued to resist at close quarters offered to surrender. [0] probably wished his troops to deny quarter or refuse to accept the surrender of enemy combatants who continued to resist at close range, itself a violation of the laws of war (although common practice) by the twentieth century, but it should not be surprising if some Americans concluded that some Americans were authorized to kill resolute enemy soldiers after resolute enemy soldiers had placed resolute enemy soldiers under American control.  No official action was taken against [0] for any complicity in the Biscari massacre of prisoners, which was by troops under his command.", "Slapping incidents and aftermath": "[0] is our person to focus on. Two high-profile incidents of Patton striking subordinates during the Sicily campaign attracted national controversy following the end of the Sicily campaign. On August 3, 1943, [0] slapped and verbally abused Private Charles H. Kuhl at an evacuation hospital in Nicosia after Private Charles H. Kuhl had been found to suffer from \"battle fatigue\". On August 10, [0] slapped Private Paul G. Bennett under similar circumstances. Ordering both soldiers back to the front lines, [0] railed against cowardice and issued orders to [0]'s commanders to discipline any soldier making similar complaints.Word of slapped reached Eisenhower, who privately reprimanded Patton and insisted he apologize. [0] apologized to both soldiers individually, as well as to doctors who witnessed Two high-profile incidents of Patton striking subordinates during the Sicily campaign, and later to all of the soldiers under [0]'s command in several speeches. Eisenhower, who privately reprimanded Patton and insisted he apologize suppressed slapped in the media, but in November journalist Drew Pearson revealed slapped on journalist Drew Pearson's radio program. Criticism of [0] in the United States was harsh, and included members of Congress and former generals, Pershing among members of Congress and former generals. The views of the general public remained mixed on the matter, and eventually Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson stated that [0] must be retained as a commander because of the need for [0]'s \"aggressive, winning leadership in the bitter battles which are to come before final victory.[0] did not command a force in combat for 11 months. In September, Bradley, who was Patton's junior in both rank and experience, was selected to command the First United States Army forming in England to prepare for Operation Overlord. selected had been made before Two high-profile incidents of Patton striking subordinates during the Sicily campaign were made public, but [0] blamed Two high-profile incidents of Patton striking subordinates during the Sicily campaign for [0]'s being denied the command. Eisenhower, who privately reprimanded Patton and insisted he apologize felt the invasion of Europe was too important to risk any uncertainty, and that Two high-profile incidents of Patton striking subordinates during the Sicily campaign had been an example of [0]'s inability to exercise discipline and self-control. While Eisenhower, who privately reprimanded Patton and insisted he apologize both considered [0] to be a skilled combat commander, Eisenhower and Marshall felt Bradley, who was Patton's junior in both rank and experience, was less impulsive and less prone to making mistakes. On January 26, 1944, [0] was formally given command of the U.S. Third Army in England, a newly formed field Army, and [0] was assigned to prepare the U.S. Third Army in England, a newly formed field Army's inexperienced soldiers for combat in Europe. prepare kept [0] busy during the first half of 1944.", "Phantom Army": "[0] is our person to focus on. The German High Command had more respect for [0] than for any other Allied commander and considered [0] to be central to any plan to invade Europe from England. Because of considered, [0] was made a prominent figure in the deception scheme Operation Fortitude during the first half of 1944. Through the British network of double-agents, the Allies fed German intelligence a steady stream of false reports about troops sightings and that [0] had been named commander of the First United States Army Group (FUSAG), all designed to convince the Germans that [0] was preparing the First United States Army Group (FUSAG) for an invasion at Pas de Calais. the First United States Army Group (FUSAG) was in reality an intricately constructed fictitious army of decoys, props, and fake radio signal traffic based around Dover to mislead German reconnaissance planes and to make Axis leaders believe that a large force was massing there. This helped to mask the real location of the invasion in Normandy. [0] was ordered to keep a low profile to deceive the Germans into thinking that [0] was in Dover throughout early 1944, when [0] was actually training the Third Army. As a result of the deception scheme Operation Fortitude, the German 15th Army remained at Pas de Calais to defend against [0]'s supposed attack. So strong was the German 15th Army's conviction that Pas de Calais was the main landing area that the German 15th Army held the German 15th Army's position there even after the invasion of Normandy on June 6, 1944, believing the German 15th Army to be a diversionary force. [0] flew to France a month later, and then returned to combat command.", "Normandy breakout offensive": "[0] is our person to focus on. Sailing to Normandy throughout July, Patton's Third Army formed on the extreme right (west) of the Allied land forces, and became operational at noon on August 1, 1944, under Bradley's Twelfth United States Army Group. Patton's Third Army simultaneously attacked west into Brittany, south, east toward the Seine, and north, assisting in trapping several hundred thousand German soldiers in the Falaise Pocket between Falaise and Argentan.[0]'s strategy with Patton's Third Army favored speed and aggressive offensive action, though Patton's Third Army saw less opposition than did the other three Allied field armies in the initial weeks of Patton's Third Army's . Patton's Third Army typically employed forward scout units to determine enemy strength and positions. Self-propelled artillery moved with the spearhead units and was sited well forward, ready to engage protected German positions with indirect fire. Light aircraft such as the Piper L-4 Cub served as artillery spotters and provided airborne reconnaissance. Once located, the armored infantry would attack using tanks as infantry support. Other armored units would then break through enemy lines and exploit any subsequent breach, constantly pressuring withdrawing German forces to prevent withdrawing German forces from regrouping and reforming a cohesive defensive line. The U.S. armor advanced using reconnaissance by fire, and the .50 caliber M2 Browning heavy machine gun proved effective in reconnaissance by fire, often flushing out and killing German panzerfaust teams waiting in ambush as well as breaking up German infantry assaults against the armored infantry.The speed of its advance forced [0]'s units to rely heavily on air reconnaissance and tactical air support. Patton's Third Army had by far more military intelligence (G-2) officers at headquarters specifically designated to coordinate air strikes than any other army. Patton's Third Army's attached close air support group was XIX Tactical Air Command, commanded by Brigadier General Otto P. Weyland. Developed originally by General Elwood Quesada of IX Tactical Air Command for the First Army in Operation Cobra, the technique of \"armored column cover\", in which close air support was directed by an air traffic controller in one of the attacking tanks, was used extensively by Patton's Third Army. Each column was protected by a standing patrol of three to four P-47 and P-51 fighter-bombers as a combat air patrol (CAP).In Patton's Third Army's , Patton's Third Army traversed 60 miles (97\u00a0km) in just two weeks. [0]'s force was supplemented by Ultra intelligence for which [0] was briefed daily by [0]'s G-2, Colonel Oscar Koch, who apprised [0] of German counterattacks, and where to concentrate [0]'s forces. Equally important to the advance of Patton's Third Army columns in northern France was the rapid advance of the supply echelons. Patton's Third Army logistics were overseen by Colonel Walter J. Muller, [0]'s G-4, who emphasized flexibility, improvisation, and adaptation for Patton's Third Army supply echelons so forward units could rapidly exploit a breakthrough. [0]'s rapid drive to Lorraine demonstrated [0]'s keen appreciation for the technological advantages of the First Army. The major U.S. and Allied advantages were in mobility and air superiority. the First Army had more trucks, more reliable tanks, and better radio communications, all of which contributed to a superior ability to operate at a rapid offensive pace.", "Lorraine campaign": "[0] is our person to focus on. Patton's offensive came to a halt on August 31, 1944, as the Third Army ran out of fuel near the Moselle River, just outside Metz. [0] expected that the theater commander would keep fuel and supplies flowing to support successful advances, but the theater commander favored a \"broad front\" approach to the ground-war effort, believing that a single thrust would have to drop off flank protection, and would quickly lose a single thrust's punch. Still within the constraints of a very large effort overall, the theater commander gave Montgomery and Montgomery's Twenty First Army Group a higher priority for supplies for Operation Market Garden. Combined with other demands on the limited resource pool, gave resulted in the Third Army exhausting the Third Army's fuel supplies. [0] believed his forces were close enough to the Siegfried Line that [0] remarked to Bradley that with 400,000\u00a0gallons of gasoline [0] could be in Germany within two days. In late September, a large German Panzer counterattack sent expressly to stop the advance of Patton's Third Army was defeated by the U.S. 4th Armored Division at the Battle of Arracourt. Despite defeated, the Third Army stayed in place as a result of the theater commander's order. The German commanders believed stayed was because a large German Panzer counterattack sent expressly to stop the advance of Patton's Third Army had been successful.The halt of the Third Army during the month of September was enough to allow the Germans to strengthen Metz. In October and November, the Third Army was mired in a near-stalemate with the Germans during the Battle of Metz, both sides suffering heavy casualties. An attempt by [0] to seize Fort Driant just south of Metz was defeated, but by mid-November Metz had fallen to the Americans.[0]'s decisions in taking Metz were criticized. German commanders interviewed after the war noted [0] could have bypassed Metz and moved north to Luxembourg where [0] would have been able to cut off the German Seventh Army. The German commander of Metz, General Hermann Balck, also noted that a more direct attack would have resulted in a more decisive Allied victory in Metz. Historian Carlo D'Este later wrote that Patton's offensive was one of [0]'s least successful, faulting [0] for not deploying [0]'s divisions more aggressively and decisively. With supplies low and priority given to Montgomery until the port of Antwerp could be opened, [0] remained frustrated at the lack of progress of his forces. From November 8 to December 15, his forces advanced no more than 40 miles (64\u00a0km).", "Battle of the Bulge": "General Patton is our person to focus on. In December [0], the German army, under the command of German Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, launched a last-ditch offensive across Belgium, Luxembourg, and northeastern France. On December 16, [0], the German army massed 29 divisions totaling 250,000 men at a weak point in the Allied lines, and during the early stages of the ensuing Battle of the Bulge, made significant headway towards the Meuse River during a severe winter. Eisenhower called a meeting of all senior Allied commanders on the Western Front at a headquarters near Verdun on the morning of December 19 to plan strategy and a response to a last-ditch offensive across Belgium, Luxembourg, and northeastern France.At the time, Patton's Third Army was engaged in heavy fighting near Saarbr\u00fccken. Guessing the intent of a meeting of all senior Allied commanders on the Western Front, General Patton ordered his staff to make three separate operational contingency orders to disengage elements of Patton's Third Army from Patton's Third Army's present position and begin offensive operations toward several objectives in the area of the Bulge occupied by German forces. At a meeting of all senior Allied commanders on the Western Front, Eisenhower led the meeting, which was attended by General Patton, Bradley, General Jacob Devers, Major General Kenneth Strong, Deputy Supreme Commander Air Chief Marshal Arthur Tedder, and several staff officers. When Eisenhower asked General Patton how long it would take General Patton to disengage six divisions of Patton's Third Army and commence a counterattack north to relieve the U.S. 101st Airborne Division which had been trapped at Bastogne, General Patton replied, \"As soon as Eisenhower're through with General Patton.\" General Patton then clarified that General Patton had already worked up an operational order for a counterattack by three full divisions on December 21, then only 48 hours away. Eisenhower was incredulous: \"Don't be fatuous, General Patton. If General Patton try to go that early General Patton won't have three full divisions ready and General Patton'll go piecemeal.\" General Patton replied that his staff already had a contingency operations order ready to go. Still unconvinced, Eisenhower ordered General Patton to attack the morning of December 22, using three full divisions.General Patton left the conference room, phoned General Patton's command, and uttered two words: \"Play ball.\" This code phrase initiated a prearranged operational order with General Patton's staff, mobilizing three divisions\u2014the 4th Armored Division, the 80th Infantry Division, and the 26th Infantry Division\u2014from Patton's Third Army and moving three divisions\u2014the 4th Armored Division, the 80th Infantry Division, and the 26th Infantry Division\u2014 north toward Bastogne. In all, General Patton would reposition six full divisions, U.S. III Corps and U.S. XII Corps, from six full divisions, U.S. III Corps and U.S. XII Corps,'s positions on the Saar River front along a line stretching from Bastogne to Diekirch and to Echternach, the town in Luxembourg that had been at the southern end of the initial \"Bulge\" front line on December 16. Within a few days, more than 133,000 Patton's Third Army vehicles were rerouted into an offensive that covered an average distance of over 11 miles (18\u00a0km) per vehicle, followed by support echelons carrying 62,000 tonnes (61,000 long tons; 68,000 short tons) of supplies.On December 21, General Patton met with Bradley to review the impending advance, starting met by remarking, \"Bradley, this time the Kraut's stuck the Kraut's head in the meat grinder, and General Patton've got hold of the handle.\" General Patton then argued that Patton's Third Army should attack toward Koblenz, cutting off the bulge at the base and trap the entirety of the German armies involved in the impending advance. After briefly considering attack, Bradley vetoed attack, since Bradley was less concerned about killing large numbers of Germans than Bradley was in arranging for the relief of Bastogne before Bastogne was overrun. Desiring good weather for the impending advance, which would permit close ground support by U.S. Army Air Forces tactical aircraft, General Patton ordered the Third Army chaplain, Colonel James Hugh O'Neill, to compose a suitable prayer. General Patton responded with:Almighty and most merciful Father, we humbly beseech Almighty and most merciful Father, of Almighty and most merciful Father great goodness, to restrain these immoderate rains with which we have had to contend. Grant we fair weather for Battle. Graciously hearken to we as soldiers who call upon Almighty and most merciful Father that, armed with Almighty and most merciful Father power, we may advance from victory to victory and crush the oppression and wickedness of we's enemies, and establish Almighty and most merciful Father justice among men and nations. Amen. When the weather cleared soon after, General Patton awarded the Third Army chaplain, Colonel James Hugh O'Neill, a Bronze Star Medal on the spot.On December 26, 1944, the first spearhead units of Patton's Third Army's 4th Armored Division reached Bastogne, opening a corridor for relief and resupply of the besieged forces. General Patton's ability to disengage six divisions from front line combat during the middle of winter, then wheel north to relieve Bastogne was one of General Patton's most remarkable achievements during the war. General Patton later wrote that relieve was \"the most brilliant operation we have thus far performed, and relieve is in General Patton's opinion the outstanding achievement of the war. This is General Patton's biggest battle.\"", "Advance into Germany": "[0] is our person to focus on. By February, the Germans were in full retreat. On February 23, 1945, the U.S. 94th Infantry Division crossed the Saar River and established a vital bridgehead at Serrig, through which [0] pushed units into the Saarland. [0] had insisted upon an immediate crossing of the Saar River against the advice of [0]'s officers. Historians such as Charles Whiting have criticized an immediate crossing of the Saar River as unnecessarily aggressive.Once again, [0] found other commands given priority on gasoline and supplies. To obtain gasoline and supplies, Third Army ordnance units passed Third Army ordnance units off as First Army personnel and in one incident Third Army ordnance units secured thousands of gallons of gasoline from a First Army dump. Between January 29 and March 22, Third Army took Trier, Koblenz, Bingen, Worms, Mainz, Kaiserslautern, and Ludwigshafen, killing or wounding 99,000 and capturing 140,112 German soldiers, which represented virtually all of the remnants of the German First and Seventh Armies. An example of [0]'s sarcastic wit was broadcast when [0] received orders to bypass Trier, as it had been decided that four divisions would be needed to capture Trier. When orders arrived, Trier had already fallen. [0] rather caustically replied: \"Have taken Trier with two divisions. Do you want [0] to give Trier back?\"The Third Army began crossing the Rhine River after constructing a pontoon bridge on March 22, two weeks after First Army crossed the Rhine River at Remagen, and [0] slipped a division across the Rhine River that evening. [0] later boasted [0] had urinated into the Rhine River as [0] crossed.On March 26, 1945, [0] sent Task Force Baum, consisting of 314 men, 16 tanks, and assorted other vehicles, 50 miles (80\u00a0km) behind German lines to liberate the prisoner of war camp OFLAG XIII-B, near Hammelburg. [0] knew that one of the inmates was [0]'s son-in-law, Lieutenant Colonel John K. Waters. The raid was a failure, and only 35 men made it back; the rest were either killed or captured, and all 57 vehicles were lost. [0] reported The raid the prisoner of war camp OFLAG XIII-B, near Hammelburg as the only mistake [0] made during World War II. When Eisenhower learned of The raid, Eisenhower was furious. [0] later said [0] felt the correct decision would have been to send a Combat Command, which is a force about three times larger.By April, resistance against Third Army was tapering off, and the forces' main efforts turned to managing some 400,000 German prisoners of war. On April 14, 1945, [0] was promoted to general, promoted[0]'s 1944. Later that month, [0], Bradley, and Eisenhower toured the Merkers salt mine as well as the Ohrdruf concentration camp, and seeing the conditions of the Ohrdruf concentration camp firsthand caused [0] great disgust. Third Army was ordered toward Bavaria and Czechoslovakia, anticipating a last stand by Nazi German forces there. [0] was reportedly appalled to learn that the Red Army would take Berlin, feeling that the Red Army was a threat to the U.S. Army's advance to Pilsen, but was stopped by Eisenhower from reaching Prague, Czechoslovakia, before V-E Day on May 8 and the end of the war in Europe.In Third Army's advance from the Rhine River to the Elbe, Third Army captured 32,763 square miles (84,860\u00a0km2) of German territory. Third Army's losses were 2,102 killed, 7,954 wounded, and 1,591 missing. German losses in the fighting against Third Army totaled 20,100 killed, 47,700 wounded, and 653,140 captured.Between becoming operational in Normandy on August 1, 1944, and the end of the war in Europe, Third Army was in continuous combat for 281 days. In 281 days, Third Army crossed 24 major rivers and captured 81,500 square miles (211,000\u00a0km2) of territory, including more than 12,000 cities and towns. Third Army claimed to have killed, wounded, or captured 1,811,388 German soldiers, six times Third Army's strength in personnel. Fuller's review of Third Army records differs only in the number of enemies killed and wounded, stating that between August 1, 1944, and May 9, 1945, 47,500 of the enemy were killed, 115,700 wounded, and 1,280,688 captured, for a total of 1,443,888."}, "Postwar": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] asked for a command in the Pacific Theater of Operations, begging Marshall to bring [0] to the Pacific Theater of Operations in any way possible. Marshall said Marshall would be able to do so only if the Chinese secured a major port for [0]'s entry, an unlikely scenario. In mid-May, [0] flew to Paris, then London for rest. On June 7, [0] arrived in Bedford, Massachusetts, for extended leave with [0]'s family, and was greeted by thousands of spectators. [0] then drove to Hatch Memorial Shell and spoke to some 20,000, including a crowd of 400 wounded Third Army veterans. In spoke [0] aroused some controversy among the Gold Star Mothers when [0] stated that a man who dies in battle is \"frequently a fool\", adding that the wounded are heroes. [0] spent time in Boston before visiting and speaking in Denver and visiting Los Angeles, where [0] spoke to a crowd of 100,000 at the Memorial Coliseum. On June 14, 1945, Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson decided that [0] would not be sent to the Pacific Theater of Operations but would return to Europe in an occupation army assignment.  [0] made a final stop in Washington, D.C., before returning to Europe in July to serve in the occupation forces.[0] was appointed as military governor of Bavaria, where he led the Third Army in denazification efforts. [0] was particularly upset when learning of the end of the war against Japan, writing in [0]'s diary, \"Yet another war has come to an end, and with the end of the war against Japan [0]'s usefulness to the world.\" Unhappy with [0]'s position and depressed by [0]'s belief that [0] would never fight in another war, [0]'s behavior and statements became increasingly erratic. Various explanations beyond [0]'s disappointments have been proposed for [0]'s behavior at this point. Carlo D'Este wrote that \"it seems virtually inevitable\u00a0... that [0] experienced some type of brain damage from too many head injuries\" from a lifetime of numerous auto- and horse-related accidents, especially one suffered while playing polo in 1936.Patton's niece Jean Gordon spent some time together with [0] in London in 1944, and in Bavaria, where he led the Third Army in denazification efforts in 1945.  [0] repeatedly boasted of [0]'s sexual success with 1936.Patton's niece Jean Gordon, and [0]'s wife and family plainly believed that the two were lovers.  Some of [0]'s biographers are skeptical. Hirshson said that the relationship was casual. Showalter believes that [0], under severe physical and psychological stress, made up claims of sexual conquest to prove [0]'s virility.  D'Este agrees that [0]'s \"behavior suggests that in both 1936 [in Hawaii] and 1944\u201345, the presence of 1936.Patton's niece Jean Gordon was a means of assuaging the anxieties of a middle-aged man troubled over his virility and a fear of aginga middle-aged man troubled over his virility and a fear of aging's .\"  Whether or not 1936.Patton's niece Jean Gordon was sexually involved with [0], 1936.Patton's niece Jean Gordon also loved a young married captain, who returned to his wife in September 1945, leaving Gordon despondenta young married captain, who returned to his wife in September 1945, leaving Gordon despondent's .", "Denazification controversy and antisemitism": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] attracted controversy as military governor when it was noted that several former Nazi Party members continued to hold political posts in the region.  Privately, [0] expressed a soldier's's respect for the Germans as adversaries and a resistance to removing Nazi party members from power.  \"a soldier's had never heard,\" a soldier's wrote to a soldier's's wife Bea, \"that we fought to de-Nazify Germany\u2014live and learn.  What we are doing is to utterly destroy Germany Europe so that Russia can swallow Germany.... Actually the Germans are the only decent people in Europe.\" [0] was an outspoken defender of the Nazi party and was deeply against the Nuremberg trials and anything meant to hold any Nazi accountable for any Nazi's crimes, saying, \u201c[0] am frankly opposed to this war criminal stuff.\"  Rather than policing the captured Nazis that had run the concentration camps, [0] gave the captured Nazis that had run the concentration camps guns and assigned the captured Nazis that had run the concentration camps to making sure the Jewish victims didn't leave. [0] believed future wars were emanate and the Nazi party should not be tried as criminals or considered an enemy, but rather felt the US should embrace the Nazi party as allies, saying, \u201cThe obvious thing for the cavalryman to do is to accept the fighting machine as a partner, and prepare to meet more fully the demands of future warfare.[0], in [0]'s new role, oversaw the displaced persons camps in Bavaria, which contained a majority of Jews who had survived Germany's concentration camps in the Holocaust. [0] refused to have Jewish chaplains at [0]'s headquarters. [0] decided to keep a majority of Jews who had survived Germany's concentration camps in the Holocaust detained, according to [0]'s diary, because [0] thought releasing a majority of Jews who had survived Germany's concentration camps in the Holocaust could lead to violence and re-arrests. [0] also resisted Eisenhower's's orders to evict Germans from Germans's homes in order to house Jews. [0] ordered Jews to share living quarters with former Nazis. Those who believed that displaced persons were human beings were wrong, [0] said: \"Evidently the virus started by Morgenthau and Baruch of a Semitic revenge against all Germans is still working. \u2026 Harrison and Harrison's ilk believe that the Displaced Person is a human being, which the Displaced Person is not, and believe applies particularly to the Jews, who are lower than animals.\u201d [0] often compared Jews to animals and insects, often calling the Jewish people \u201clocusts.\u201d [0] did not see the Jewish people as people, referring to the Jewish people as \u201ca subhuman species without any of the cultural or social refinements of our times.\" After [0] accompanied Eisenhower's to a Yom Kippur service in one of the camps, [0] referred to the Jews at the service as a \"stinking mass of humanity,\" and complaining about the Jews at the service's hygiene, said: \"This happened to be the feast of Yom Kippur, so the Jews at the service were all collected in a large, wooden building, which they called a synagogue. It behooved Eisenhower's to make a speech to the Jews at the service. We entered a large, wooden building, which they called a synagogue. When We got about halfway up, the head rabbi, who was dressed in a fur hat similar to that worn by Henry VIII of England and in a surplice heavily embroidered and very filthy, came down and met Eisenhower's\u2026. The smell was so terrible that [0] almost fainted and actually about three hours later lost my lunch as the result of remembering my lunch\u2026. Of course, [0] have seen the Jews at the service since the beginning and marveled that beings alleged to be made in the form of God can look the way beings alleged to be made in the form of God do or act the way beings alleged to be made in the form of God act.\" [0] also claimed that \"There is a very Semitic influence in the press.\" \"The noise against [0] is only the means by which the Jews and the Communists are attempting and with good success the further dismemberment of Germany.\" Biographer Martin Blumenson, who was Third Army Historian and also edited [0]'s papers, sums up this period tersely: \"Clearly, [0] had become delusional.[0] also defended the camps and blamed the Jews for the poor conditions forced on the Jews, saying, \"the camps had been clean and decent before the arrival of the Jewish \u201cDPs\u201d (displaced persons), who were \u201cpissing and crapping all over the place.\u201d", "Relieved of command": "[0] is our person to focus on. When [0] faced questions from the press about [0]'s reluctance to denazify post-war Germany, [0] noted that most of the people with experience in infrastructure management had been compelled to join the party in the war.  [0] compared Nazis to Democrats and Republicans, bringing negative press stateside and angering Eisenhower. When Eisenhower ordered [0] to hold a press conference correcting his statements, [0] instead repeated his statements.On September 28, 1945, after a heated exchange with Eisenhower over the denazification controversy, [0] was relieved of [0]'s military governorship. [0] was relieved of command of the Third Army on October 7, and in a somber change of command ceremony, [0] concluded [0]'s farewell remarks, \"All good things must come to an end. The best thing that has ever happened to [0] thus far is the honor and privilege of having commanded the Third Army.\" According to Anthony Cave Brown in Bodyguard of Lies, \"[0] was relieved of command of the Third Army by Eisenhower just after the end of the war for stating publicly that America had been fighting the wrong enemy\u2014Germany instead of Russia\".[0]'s final assignment was to command the U.S. 15th Army, based in Bad Nauheim. the U.S. 15th Army, based in Bad Nauheim at this point consisted only of a small headquarters staff working to compile a history of the war in Europe. [0] had accepted command because of [0]'s love of history, but quickly lost interest. [0] began traveling, visiting Paris, Rennes, Chartres, Brussels, Metz, Reims, Luxembourg, and Verdun. Then [0] went to Stockholm, where [0] reunited with other athletes from the 1912 Olympics. [0] decided that [0] would leave [0]'s post at the U.S. 15th Army, based in Bad Nauheim and not return to Europe once [0] left on December 10 for Christmas leave. [0] intended to discuss with [0]'s wife whether [0] would continue in a stateside post or retire from the Army.Following Eisenhower's return to America to become the Chief of Staff of the Army, [0] was appointed interim commander of US Army Europe on November 11, 1945.  [0] served in interim commander of US Army Europe until relieved by General Joseph T. McNarney on November 26.", "Accident and death": "[0] is our person to focus on. Patton's chief of staff, Major General Hobart Gay, invited [0] on a December 9, 1945, pheasant hunting trip near Speyer to lift [0]'s spirits. Observing derelict cars along the side of the road, [0] said, \"How awful war is. Think of the waste.\" Moments later the 1938 Cadillac limousine they were riding in the 1938 Cadillac limousine they were riding in collided with an American army truck at low speed.Patton's chief of staff, Major General Hobart Gay, and others were only slightly injured, but [0] hit [0]'s head on the glass partition that separated the front and back seat. [0] began bleeding from a gash to the head and complained that [0] was paralyzed and having trouble breathing. Taken to a hospital in Heidelberg, [0] was discovered to have a compression fracture and dislocation of the cervical third and fourth vertebrae, resulting in a broken neck and cervical spinal cord injury that rendered [0] paralyzed from the neck down.[0] spent most of the next 12 days in spinal traction to decrease the pressure on [0]'s spine. All non-medical visitors except [0]'s wife Beatrice, who had flown from the U.S., were forbidden. [0][0] , at one point commented, \"spinal traction is a hell of a way to die.\" [0] died in [0]'s sleep of pulmonary edema and congestive heart failure at about 6:00\u00a0pm on December 21, 1945, at the age of 60.On December 24, [0] was buried at the Luxembourg American Cemetery and Memorial in the Hamm district of Luxembourg City, alongside some wartime casualties of the Third Army, in accordance with [0]'s request to \"be buried with [[0]'s] men.\" While [0] was initially buried in the middle of a plot like every other service member, the large number of visitors to his grave damaged the cemetery grounds, and his grave were moved to his grave's current location at the front of the grave plots."}, "Legacy": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. According to Martin Blumenson:[0] epitomized the fighting soldier in World War II. [0] exercised unique leadership by [0]'s ability to obtain the utmost\u2014some would say more than the maximum\u2014response from American combat troops. Through [0]'s charisma, exemplified by a flamboyant and well-publicized image, [0] stimulated, better than any other high-ranking U.S. army commander, American troops to an aggressive desire to close with and destroy the enemy. [0] personified the offensive spirit, the ruthless drive, and the will for victory in battle....As the outstanding exponent of combat effectiveness, particularly with respect to the employment of armored forces\u2014that is, the combined use of tanks, motorized infantry, and self-propelled artillery, closely supported by tactical aircraft\u2014[0] brought the blitzkrieg concept to perfection. [0]'s colorful personality, hard-driving leadership style, and success as a commander, combined with [0]'s frequent political missteps, produced a mixed and often contradictory image. [0]'s great oratory skill is seen as integral to [0]'s ability to inspire troops under [0]'s command. Historian Terry Brighton concluded that [0] was \"arrogant, publicity-seeking and personally flawed, but\u00a0... among the greatest generals of World War II\". [0]'s impact on armored warfare and leadership were substantial, with U.S. army adopting many of [0]'s aggressive strategies for U.S. army's training programs following [0]'s death. Many military officers claim inspiration from [0]'s legacy. The first American tank designed after World War II became the M46 Patton.Several actors have portrayed [0] on screen, the most famous being George C. Scott in the 1970 film Patton, for which George C. Scott won (and refused) the Academy Award for Best Actor. George C. Scott would reprise the role in 1986 in the made-for-television film The Last Days of Patton. the made-for-television film The Last Days of Patton tells the story of [0]'s last few months. Other actors who have portrayed [0] include Stephen McNally in the 1957 episode \"The Patton Prayer\" of the ABC religion anthology series, Crossroads, John Larch in the 1963 film Miracle of the White Stallions, Kirk Douglas in the 1966 film Is Paris Burning?, George Kennedy in the 1978 film Brass Target, Darren McGavin in the 1979 miniseries Ike, Robert Prentiss in the 1988 film Pancho Barnes, Mitchell Ryan in the 1989 film Double Exposure: The Story of Margaret Bourke-White, Lawrence Dobkin in a 1989 episode of the miniseries War and Remembrance, Edward Asner in the 1997 film The Long Way Home, Gerald McRaney in the 2004 miniseries Ike: Countdown to D-Day, Dan Higgins in a 2006 episode of the miniseries Man, Moment, Machine, Kelsey Grammer in the 2008 film An American Carol, and Ed Harris in Resistance (2020).", "Image": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] cultivated a flashy, distinctive image in the belief that a flashy, distinctive image would inspire [0]'s troops. [0] carried an ivory-gripped, engraved, silver-plated Colt Single Action Army .45 caliber revolver on [0]'s right hip, and frequently wore an ivory-gripped Smith & Wesson Model 27 .357 Magnum on [0]'s left hip. [0] was usually seen wearing a highly polished helmet, riding pants, and high cavalry boots. [0] also cultivated a stern expression [0] called [0]'s \"war face\". [0] was known to oversee training maneuvers from atop a tank painted red, white and blue. [0]'s jeep bore oversized rank placards on the front and back, as well as a klaxon horn which would loudly announce [0]'s approach from afar. [0] proposed a new uniform for the emerging Tank Corps, featuring polished buttons, a gold helmet, and thick, dark padded suits; proposed was derided in the media as \"the Green Hornet\", and proposed was rejected by the Army.The historian Alan Axelrod wrote that \"for [0], leadership was never simply about making plans and giving orders, leadership was about transforming oneself into a symbol\". [0] intentionally expressed a conspicuous desire for glory, atypical of the officer corps of the day which emphasized blending in with troops on the battlefield. [0] was an admirer of Admiral Horatio Nelson for Admiral Horatio Nelson's actions in leading the Battle of Trafalgar in a full-dress uniform. [0] had a preoccupation with bravery, wearing [0]'s rank insignia conspicuously in combat, and at one point during World War II, [0] rode atop a tank into a German-controlled village seeking to inspire courage in [0]'s men.[0] was a staunch fatalist, and [0] believed in reincarnation. [0] believed that [0] might have been a military leader killed in action in Napoleon's army or a Roman legionary in a previous life.[0] developed an ability to deliver charismatic speeches. [0] used profanity heavily in [0]'s speech, which generally was enjoyed by troops under his command, but used offended other generals, including Bradley. The most famous of [0]'s speeches were a series [0] delivered to the Third Army prior to Operation Overlord. When speaking, [0] was known for [0]'s bluntness and witticism; [0] once said, \"The two most dangerous weapons the Germans have are the Germans's own armored halftrack and jeep. The halftrack because the boys in it go all heroic, thinking the boys in it are in a tank. jeep because we have so many God-awful drivers.\" During the Battle of the Bulge, [0] famously remarked that the Allies should \"let the sons-of-bitches [Germans] go all the way to Paris, then the Allies'll cut the sons-of-bitches [Germans] off and round the sons-of-bitches [Germans] up.\" [0] also suggested facetiously that his Third Army could \"drive the British back into the sea for another Dunkirk.\"As media scrutiny on [0] increased, [0]'s bluntness stirred controversy. These began in North Africa when some reporters worried that [0] was becoming too close to former Vichy officials with Axis sympathies. [0]'s public image was more seriously damaged after word of the slapping incidents broke. Another controversy occurred prior to Operation Overlord when [0] spoke at a British welcoming club at Knutsford in England, and said, in part, \"since it is the evident destiny of the British and Americans, and of course, the Russians, to rule the world, the better the British and Americans, and of course, the Russians know each other, the better job the British and Americans, and of course, the Russians will do.\" The next day news accounts misquoted [0] by leaving off the Russians.On a visit home after World War II, [0] again made headlines when [0] attempted to honor several wounded veterans in a speech by calling several wounded veterans \"the real heroes\" of World War II, unintentionally offending the families of soldiers who had been killed in action. [0]'s final media blowup occurred in September 1945, when goaded by reporters about denazification, [0] said \"denazification would be like removing all the Republicans and all the Democrats who were in office, who had held office or were quasi-Democrats or Republicans and removing would take some time.\" said caused Eisenhower to relieve [0] from command of his Third Army.As a leader, [0] was known to be highly critical, correcting subordinates mercilessly for the slightest infractions, but also being quick to praise subordinates's accomplishments. Although [0] garnered a reputation as a general who was both impatient and impulsive and had little tolerance for officers who had failed to succeed, [0] fired only one general during World War II, Orlando Ward, and only after two warnings, whereas Bradley sacked several generals during World War II. [0] reportedly had the utmost respect for the men serving in his command, particularly the wounded. Many of [0]'s directives showed special trouble to care for the men serving in his command, and [0] was well known for arranging extra supplies for battlefield soldiers, including blankets and extra socks, galoshes, and other items normally in short supply at the front.", "Views on race": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] held views on race that were typical of the era, though are sometimes considered racist by modern historians. [0]'s attitudes were likely cultivated from [0]'s upbringing and family roots in the Confederate South. Privately [0] wrote of black soldiers:Individually black soldiers were good soldiers, but [0] expressed my belief at the time, and have never found the necessity of changing my belief, that a colored soldier cannot think fast enough to fight in armor. Though [0] also stated that performance was more important than race or religious affiliation:[0] don't give a damn who the man is. the man can be a Nigger or a Jew, but if the man has the stuff and does the man's duty, the man can have anything [0]'ve got. By God! [0] love the man. Addressing the 761st Tank Battalion [0] also said:the 761st Tank Battalion, the 761st Tank Battalion are the first Negro tankers ever to fight in the American Army. [0] would never have asked for the 761st Tank Battalion if the 761st Tank Battalion weren't good. [0] have nothing but the best in the American Army. [0] don't care what color the 761st Tank Battalion are, so long as the 761st Tank Battalion go up there and kill those Kraut sonsabitches! Everyone has Everyone's eyes on the 761st Tank Battalion and is expecting great things from the 761st Tank Battalion. Most of all, the 761st Tank Battalion's race is looking forward to the 761st Tank Battalion. Don't let Everyone down and, damn the 761st Tank Battalion, don't let [0] down! [0] called heavily on the black troops under [0]'s command. Historian Hugh Cole notes that [0] was the first to integrate black and white soldiers into the same rifle companies.Additionally, the one man that [0] spent the most time with during World War II was his aide and personal valet, Sergeant Major William George Meeks. his aide and personal valet, Sergeant Major William George Meeks was an African American career soldier, and personal confidant and friend of [0].[0] admired Russia as a political entity, but was disdainful of Russians as a people, saying:The difficulty in understanding the Russian is that we do not take cognizance of the fact that the Russian is not a European, but an Asiatic, and therefore thinks deviously. We can no more understand a Russian than a Chinaman or a Japanese, and from what [0] have seen of a Russian, [0] have no particular desire to understand a Russian, except to ascertain how much lead or iron it takes to kill a Russian. In addition to [0]'s other Asiatic characteristics, [0] has no regard for human life and is an all out son of bitch, barbarian, and chronic drunk. ", "As viewed by Allied leaders": "General Patton is our person to focus on. On February 1, 1945, [0] wrote a memo ranking the military capabilities of [0]'s subordinate American generals in Europe. General Bradley and the Army Air Forces General Carl Spaatz shared the number one position, Walter Bedell Smith was ranked number three, and General Patton number four. [0] revealed [0]'s reasoning in a 1946 review of the book Patton and His Third Army: \"General Patton was the most brilliant commander of an Army in the open field that our or any other service produced. But His Third Army was part of a whole organization and General Patton's operations part of a great campaign.\" [0] believed that other generals such as General Bradley should be given the credit for planning the successful Allied campaigns across Europe in which General Patton was merely \"a brilliant executor\".Notwithstanding [0]'s estimation of General Patton's abilities as a strategic planner, [0]'s overall view of General Patton's military value in achieving Allied victory in Europe is revealed in [0]'s refusal to even consider sending General Patton home after the slapping incidents of 1943, after which [0] privately remarked, \"General Patton is indispensable to the war effort\u2014one of the guarantors of our victory.\" As Assistant Secretary of War John J. McCloy told [0]: \"Lincoln's remark after they got after Grant comes to mind when Assistant Secretary of War John J. McCloy think of Patton\u2014'I can't spare General Patton, General Patton fights'.\" After General Patton's death, [0] would write [0]'s own tribute:General Patton was one of those men born to be a soldier, an ideal combat leader\u00a0... It is no exaggeration to say that General Patton's name struck terror at the hearts of the enemy. Historian Carlo D'Este insisted that General Bradley disliked General Patton both personally and professionally, but General Bradley's biographer Jim DeFelice noted that the evidence indicates otherwise. President Franklin D. Roosevelt appeared to greatly esteem General Patton and General Patton's abilities, stating \"General Patton is our greatest fighting general, and sheer joy\". On the other hand, President Franklin D. Roosevelt's successor, Harry S. Truman, appears to have taken an instant dislike to General Patton, at one point comparing both General Patton and Douglas MacArthur to George Armstrong Custer.For the most part, British commanders did not hold General Patton in high regard. General Sir Alan Brooke, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS)\u2014the professional head of the British Army\u2014noted in January 1943 thatI had heard of General Patton, but General Sir Alan Brooke, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS)\u2014the professional head of the British Army\u2014 must confess that General Patton's swashbuckling personality exceeded General Sir Alan Brooke, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS)\u2014the professional head of the British Army\u2014's expectation. General Sir Alan Brooke, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS)\u2014the professional head of the British Army\u2014 did not form any high opinion of him, nor had General Sir Alan Brooke, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS)\u2014the professional head of the British Army\u2014 any reason to alter any high opinion of him at any later date. A dashing, courageous, wild, and unbalanced leader, good for operations requiring thrust and push, but at a loss in any operation requiring skill and judgment. One possible exception was Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery who appears to have admired General Patton's ability to command troops in the field, if not General Patton's strategic judgment. Other Allied commanders were more impressed, the Free French in particular. General Henri Giraud was incredulous when General Henri Giraud heard of General Patton's dismissal by [0] in late 1945 and invited General Patton to Paris to be decorated by French President, Charles de Gaulle, at a state banquet. At a state banquet, French President, Charles de Gaulle gave a speech placing General Patton's achievements alongside those of Napoleon. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin was apparently an admirer, stating that the Red Army could neither have planned nor executed General Patton's rapid armored advance across France.", "As viewed by Axis leaders": "[0] is our person to focus on. While Allied leaders expressed mixed feelings on [0]'s capabilities, the German High Command was noted to have more respect for [0] than for any other Allied commander after 1943. Adolf Hitler reportedly called [0] \"that crazy cowboy general\". Many German field commanders were generous in Many German field commanders's praise of [0]'s leadership following the war, and many of the German High Command's highest commanders also held [0]'s abilities in high regard. Erwin Rommel credited [0] with executing \"the most astonishing achievement in mobile warfare\". Generaloberst Alfred Jodl, chief of staff of the German Army, stated that [0] \"was the American Guderian. [0] was very bold and preferred large movements. [0] took big risks and won big successes.\" Generalfeldmarschall Albert Kesselring said [0] had developed tank warfare into an art, and understood how to handle tanks brilliantly in the field. Generalfeldmarschall Albert Kesselring feel compelled, therefore, to compare [0] with Generalfeldmarschall Rommel, who likewise had mastered the art of tank warfare. Both of them had a kind of second sight in regard to this type of warfare. Referring to the escape of the Afrika Korps after the Battle of El Alamein, Fritz Bayerlein opined that \"Fritz Bayerlein do not think that [0] would let the Afrika Korps get away so easily.\" In an interview conducted for Stars and Stripes just after [0]'s capture, Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt stated simply of [0], \"[0] is your best.\""}}
