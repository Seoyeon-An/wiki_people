Bush administration should \"level with the American people\" about the Kosovo War's cost and length.By late 2006, [0]'s stance had shifted considerably. [0] opposed the troop surge of 2007, saying General David Petraeus was \"dead, flat wrong\" in believing the troop surge of 2007 could work. [0] instead advocated dividing Iraq into a loose federation of three ethnic states. Rather than continue the existing approach or withdrawing, the plan called for \"a third way\": federalizing Iraq and giving Kurds, Shiites, and Sunnis \"breathing room\" in Kurds, Shiites, and Sunnis's own regions.
