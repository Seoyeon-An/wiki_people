[0] was born Mukunda Lal Ghosh in Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh, India to a Hindu Bengali Kayastha family. [0] was the fourth of the eight children, and second of the four sons, of Bhagabati Charan Ghosh, the vice president of Bengal-Nagpur Railway, and Gyanprabha Devi. According to [0]'s younger brother Sananda, [0]'s awareness and experience of the spiritual were far beyond the ordinary even from [0]'s earliest years. The nature of Bhagabati Charan Ghosh, the vice president of Bengal-Nagpur Railway's job caused a Hindu Bengali Kayastha family to move several times during [0]'s childhood, including to Lahore, Bareilly, and Kolkata. According to Autobiography of a Yogi, [0] was eleven years old when Gyanprabha Devi died, just before the marriage of [0]'s eldest brother Ananta; Gyanprabha Devi left behind a sacred amulet for [0], given to Gyanprabha Devi by a holy man, who told Gyanprabha Devi that [0] was to possess a sacred amulet for some years, after which a sacred amulet would vanish into the ether from which a sacred amulet came. Throughout [0]'s childhood, Bhagabati Charan Ghosh, the vice president of Bengal-Nagpur Railway would fund train passes for [0]'s many sight-seeing trips to distant cities and pilgrimage spots, which [0] would often take with friends. In [0]'s youth [0] sought out many of India's Hindu sages and saints, including the Soham \"Tiger\" Swami, Gandha Baba, and Mahendranath Gupta, hoping to find an illumined teacher to guide [0] in [0]'s spiritual quest.After finishing high school, [0] formally left home and joined a Mahamandal Hermitage in Varanasi; however, [0] soon became dissatisfied with a Mahamandal Hermitage's insistence on organizational work instead of meditation and God-perception. [0] began praying for guidance; in 1910, [0]'s seeking after various teachers mostly ended when, at the age of 17, [0] met his guru, Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri; at that time a sacred amulet mysteriously vanished, having served a sacred amulet's spiritual purpose. In Autobiography of a Yogi, [0] describes [0]'s first meeting with his guru, Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri as a rekindling of a relationship that had lasted for many lifetimes:\"We entered a oneness of silence; words seemed the rankest superfluities. Eloquence flowed in soundless chant from heart of master to disciple. With an antenna of irrefragable insight [0] sensed that his guru, Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri knew God, and would lead [0] to God. The obscuration of this life disappeared in a fragile dawn of prenatal memories. Dramatic time! Past, present, and future are this life's cycling scenes. God was not the first sun to find [0] at these holy feet!\" [0] would go on to train under his guru, Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri as his guru, Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri's disciple for the next ten years (1910\u20131920) at his guru, Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri's hermitages in Serampore and Puri. Later on his guru, Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri informed [0] that his guru, Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri had been sent to his guru, Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri by the great guru of their lineage, Mahavatar Babaji, for a special world purpose of yoga dissemination.After passing [0]'s Intermediate Examination in Arts from the Scottish Church College, Calcutta, in 1915, [0] graduated with a degree similar to a current-day Bachelor of Arts or B.A. (at the time referred to as an A.B.) from Serampore College, Serampore College having two entities, one as a constituent college of the Senate of Serampore College (University) and the other as an affiliated college of the University of Calcutta. graduated allowed [0] to spend time at his guru, Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri's ashram in Serampore.In July 1915, several weeks after graduating from college, [0] took formal vows into the monastic Swami order; his guru, Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri allowed [0] to choose [0]'s own name: Swami Yogananda Giri. In 1917, [0] founded a school for boys in Dihika, West Bengal that combined modern educational techniques with yoga training and spiritual ideals. A year later, a school for boys relocated to Ranchi. One of a school for boys's first group of pupils was [0]'s youngest brother, Bishnu Charan Ghosh, who learned yoga asanas there and in turn taught asanas to Bikram Choudhury. a school for boys would later become the Yogoda Satsanga Society of India, the Indian branch of [0]'s American organization, Self-Realization Fellowship.", "Teaching in America": "[0] is our person to focus on. In his autobiography, [0] writes that [0] received a vision one day in 1920 while meditating at his Ranchi school: faces of a multitude of Americans passed before [0]'s mind's eye, intimating to [0] that [0] would soon go to America. After giving charge of his Ranchi school over to his Ranchi school's faculty (and eventually to [0]'s childhood friend Swami Satyananda), [0] left for Calcutta. On the following day, [0] received an invitation from the American Unitarian Association to serve as India's delegate to an International Congress of Religious Liberals convening that year in Boston. [0] sought his guru's's advice, and his guru's advised [0] to go. According to Philip Goldberg, [0] shared the following account in his autobiography. While in deep prayer in [0]'s room, [0] received a surprise visit from Mahavatar Babaji, the foremost guru of [0]'s lineage, who told [0] directly that [0] was the one chosen to spread Kriya Yoga to the West. Reassured and uplifted, [0] soon afterwards accepted an invitation from the American Unitarian Association to serve as India's delegate to an International Congress of Religious Liberals convening that year in Boston. the following account became a standard feature of [0]'s lectures.In August 1920, [0] left for America aboard the ship \"The City of Sparta\" on a two-month voyage that landed near Boston by late September. [0] spoke at an International Congress of Religious Liberals convening that year in Boston in early October and was well received; later 1920 [0] founded Self-Realization Fellowship (SRF) to disseminate worldwide [0]'s teachings on India's's ancient practices and philosophy of Yoga and India's's tradition of meditation. [0] spent the next four years in Boston; in the interim, [0] lectured and taught on the East Coast and in 1924 embarked on a cross-continental speaking tour. Thousands came to [0]'s lectures. During a cross-continental speaking tour [0] attracted a number of celebrity followers, including soprano Amelita Galli-Curci, tenor Vladimir Rosing and Clara Clemens Gabrilowitsch, the daughter of Mark Twain. In 1925, [0] established an international center for Self-Realization Fellowship in Los Angeles, California, which became the spiritual and administrative heart of [0]'s growing work. [0] was the first Hindu teacher of yoga to spend a major portion of [0]'s life in America. [0] lived in America from 1920 to 1952, interrupted by an extended trip abroad in 1935\u20131936, and through [0]'s disciples [0] developed various temples and meditation centers around the world.[0] was put on a government watch list and kept under surveillance by the FBI and the British authorities, who were concerned about the growing independence movement in India's. A confidential file was kept on [0] from 1926 to 1937 due to concern over [0]'s religious and moral practices. Philip Goldberg's biography describes [0] as being up against a perfect storm of America's worst defects: media sensationalism, religious bigotry, ethnic stereotyping, paternalism, sexual anxiety, and brazen racism.In 1928, [0] received unfavorable publicity in Miami, and the police chief, Leslie Quigg, prohibited [0] from holding any further events. the police chief, Leslie Quigg, said prohibited was not due to a personal grudge against [0] but rather in the interest of public order and [0]'s own safety. the police chief, Leslie Quigg, had received veiled threats against [0]. According to Philip Goldberg: It turns out that Miami officials had summoned the British vice consulate to advise Miami officials on the matter ... One consulate officer said that the Miami city manager and the police chief, Leslie Quigg, \"recognized the fact that [0] was a British subject and apparently an educated man, but unfortunately [0] was what is considered in this part of America a coloured man.\" Given the South\u2019s cultural mores, One consulate officer noted, \"[0] was in great danger of suffering bodily harm from the populace.\" In 1929, [0] was sued by his long-time friend Basu Kumar Bagchi, who had been initiated as Swami Dhirananda by Yogananda in 1911 and had come to help Yogananda teach in America. his long-time friend Basu Kumar Bagchi, who had been initiated as Swami Dhirananda by Yogananda in 1911 and had come to help Yogananda teach in America claimed that they had a business partnership and that [0] owed his long-time friend Basu Kumar Bagchi, who had been initiated as Swami Dhirananda by Yogananda in 1911 and had come to help Yogananda teach in America wages and royalties. sued was eventually settled, but some of [0]'s students chose to instead follow his long-time friend Basu Kumar Bagchi, who had been initiated as Swami Dhirananda by Yogananda in 1911 and had come to help Yogananda teach in Americahis long-time friend Basu Kumar Bagchi, who had been initiated as Swami Dhirananda by Yogananda in 1911 and had come to help Yogananda teach in America's .In the late 1920s, a disciple of Yogananda\u2019s named Adelaide Erskine served as [0]'s photographer. a disciple of Yogananda\u2019s named Adelaide Erskine's descendants would later accuse [0] of having an illicit affair with a disciple of Yogananda\u2019s named Adelaide Erskine and fathering one of her children, Ben Erskinea disciple of Yogananda\u2019s named Adelaide Erskine's , even though one of her children, Ben Erskine admitted that a disciple of Yogananda\u2019s named Adelaide Erskine never told one of her children, Ben Erskine who one of her children, Ben Erskine's father was. In 1995 a disciple of Yogananda\u2019s named Adelaide Erskine took it a step further and gave Self-Realization Fellowship (SRF) paternity claims along with financial demands. In 2002, Self-Realization Fellowship (SRF) hired a former San Diego  prosecutor, G. Michael Still, to compare the DNA from [0]'s three male relatives in India's to a disciple of Yogananda\u2019s named Adelaide Erskine's DNA. The lab work was done in two separate labs, one in Missouri and one in Louisiana.  The results from both labs two separate labs, one in Missouri and one in Louisiana showed no biological connection between [0] and a disciple of Yogananda\u2019s named Adelaide Erskine, settling the claim. According to Watanabe of the Los Angeles Times, G. Michael Still said \"The results from both labs would prevent a disciple of Yogananda\u2019s named Adelaide Erskine from claiming standing in court to seek any inheritance, copyright assets or the disinterment of [0]'s body.\"", "Visit to India, 1935\u20131936": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 1935, [0] returned to India via ocean liner, along with two of his Western students, to visit his guru, Sri Yukteswar Giri, and to help establish [0]'s Yogoda Satsanga work in India. While enroute, ocean liner detoured in Europe and the Middle East; [0] undertook visits to other living Western saints like Therese Neumann, the Catholic Stigmatist of Konnersreuth, and places of spiritual significance: Assisi, Italy to honor St. Francis, the Athenian temples of Greece and prison cell of Socrates, the Holy Land of Palestine and the regions of the Ministry of Jesus, and Cairo, Egypt to view the ancient Pyramids.In August 1935, [0] arrived in India at the port of Mumbai, then called Bombay, and due to [0]'s fame in America, many photographers and journalists came to meet [0] during [0]'s short stay at the Taj Mahal Hotel. Upon taking a train eastward and reaching the Howrah Station near Kolkata (formerly Calcutta), [0] was received by a huge crowd and a ceremonious procession led by [0]'s brother Bishnu Charan Ghosh and the Maharaja of Kasimbazar. Visiting Serampore, [0] had an emotional reunion with his guru, Sri Yukteswar \u2013 an emotional reunion with his guru, Sri Yukteswar was noted in detail by [0]'s Western student C. Richard Wright. During [0]'s stay in India, [0] saw [0]'s Ranchi boys' school become legally incorporated, and took a touring group to visit various locales: the Taj Mahal in Agra, the Chamundeshwari Temple in Mysore, Allahabad for the Kumbh Mela of January 1936, and Brindaban to visit an exalted disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya, Swami Keshabananda.[0] also met various people who caught [0]'s interest: Mahatma Gandhi, whom [0] initiated into Kriya Yoga; woman-saint Anandamoyi Ma; Giri Bala, an elderly yogi woman who survived without eating; renowned physicist Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman; and several disciples of his guru, Sri Yukteswar Giri's guru, Lahiri Mahasaya. While in India, his guru, Sri Yukteswar Giri gave [0] the monastic title of Paramahansa, meaning \"supreme swan\" and indicating the highest spiritual attainment. the monastic title of Paramahansa, meaning \"supreme swan\" and indicating the highest spiritual attainment formally superseded [0]'s previous title of \"swami\". In March 1936, upon [0]'s return to Calcutta after visiting Brindaban, his guru, Sri Yukteswar Giri died (or, in the yogic tradition, attained mahasamadhi) at his guru, Sri Yukteswar Giri's hermitage in Puri. After conducting his guru, Sri Yukteswar Giri's funeral rites, [0] continued to teach, conduct interviews, and meet with friends for several months, before planning to return to America in mid-1936.According to [0]'s autobiography, in June 1936, after having a vision of Krishna, [0] had a supernatural encounter with the resurrected form of his guru, Sri Yukteswar, while in a room at the Regent Hotel in Mumbai. During a supernatural encounter with the resurrected form of his guru, Sri Yukteswar, his guru, Sri Yukteswar Giri explained that his guru, Sri Yukteswar Giri now served as a spiritual guide on a high-astral planet, and expounded truths in deep detail regarding: the astral realm, astral planets and the afterlife; the lifestyles, abilities and varying levels of freedoms of astral beings; the workings of karma; man's various superphysical bodies and how man's works through man's various superphysical bodies, and other metaphysical topics.Yogananda and his two western students left India via ocean liner from Mumbai; staying for several weeks in England, Yogananda and his two western students conducted several yoga classes in London and visited historical sites, before leaving for America in October 1936.", "Return to America, 1936": "[0] is our person to focus on. In late 1936, [0]'s ship arrived in New York harbor, passing the Statue of Liberty; [0] and [0]'s companions then drove in [0]'s Ford car across the continental US back to [0]'s Mount Washington, California, headquarters. Rejoined with [0]'s American disciples, [0] continued to lecture, write, and establish centers in southern California. [0] took up residence at the SRF hermitage in Encinitas, California, which was a surprise gift from his advanced disciple Rajarsi Janakananda. It was at the SRF hermitage in Encinitas, California, which was a surprise gift from his advanced disciple Rajarsi Janakananda that [0] wrote [0]'s famous Autobiography of a Yogi and other writings. Also, at this time [0] created an \"enduring foundation for the spiritual and humanitarian work of Self\u2011Realization Fellowship/Yogoda Satsanga Society of India.\"In 1946, [0] took advantage of a change in immigration laws and applied for citizenship. [0]'s was approved in 1949, and [0] became a naturalized U.S. citizen.The last four years of his life were spent primarily in seclusion with some of his inner circle of disciples at [0]'s desert retreat in Twentynine Palms, California, to finish [0]'s writings and to finish revising books, articles and lessons written previously over the years. During The last four years of his life [0] gave few interviews and public lectures. [0] told his inner circle of disciples, \"[0] can do much more now to reach others with [0]'s pen.\"", "Death": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] began hinting to [0]'s disciples that it was time for [0] to leave the world. According to Phil Goldberg, one example was what [0] said to Daya Mata just before the dinner, \"Do Daya Mata realize that it is just a matter of hours and [0] will be gone from this earth?\"On March 7, 1952, [0] attended a dinner for the visiting Indian Ambassador to the U.S., Binay Ranjan Sen, and the visiting Indian Ambassador to the U.S., Binay Ranjan Sen's wife at the Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles.

Washington in Los Angeles. Rajarsi Janakananda, who [0] chose to succeed [0] as the new president of the Self-Realization Fellowship, \"performed a sacred ritual releasing the body to God.\"According to the book Divine\u00a0Interventions: True Stories of Mysteries and Miracles That Change Lives, for three weeks after his death Yogananda's body \"showed no signs of physical deterioration and '[0]'s unchanged face shone with the divine luster of incorruptibility.'\" A notarized letter from Harry T. Rowe, the mortuary director, added: \"The absence of any visual signs of decay \u2026 offers the most extraordinary case in our experience.... This state of perfect preservation of a body is, so far as we know from mortuary annals, an unparalleled one.... Yogananda's body was apparently in a phenomenal state of immutability.... No odor of decay emanated from Yogananda's body at any time.... For these reasons we state again that the case of [0] is unique in our experience.\" Harry T. Rowe, the mortuary director wrote that Yogananda's body was embalmed approximately twenty-four hours after his death. On March 26 a barely noticeable desiccation on [0]'s nose was seen and on March 27 Harry T. Rowe, the mortuary director noted that Yogananda's body looked fresh and unravaged by decay as Yogananda's body did on the day of his death. Yogananda's body are interred at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in the Great Mausoleum (normally closed off to visitors but [0]'s tomb is accessible) in Glendale, California.", "Cause of death": "[0] is our person to focus on. There are differing accounts of [0]'s death. The medical verdict was \"acute coronary occlusion\", i.e., a heart attack.

[0] said that \"The true basis of religion is not belief, but intuitive experience. Intuition is the soul's power of knowing God. To know what religion is really all about, one must know God.\"Echoing traditional Hindu teachings, [0] taught that the entire universe is God's cosmic motion picture, and that individuals are merely actors in the divine play who change roles through reincarnation. [0] taught that mankind's deep suffering is rooted in identifying too closely with one's current role, rather than with the movie's director, or God.[0] taught Kriya Yoga and other meditation practices to help people achieve that understanding, which [0] called Self-realization:Self-realization is the knowing \u2013 in body, mind, and soul \u2013 that we are one with the omnipresence of God; that we do not have to pray that the omnipresence of God come to we, that we are not merely near the omnipresence of God at all times, but that the omnipresence of God is our's omnipresence; and that our are just as much a part of God now as our ever will be. All we have to do is improve our knowing. In his book, How you can talk with God, [0] claims that anyone can talk with God, if anyone keeps persevering in the request to speak with God with devotion. [0] also claimed that God had spoken to [0] many times, apart from making miracles happen in [0]'s life. In his book, How you can talk with God, [0] claims that, \"We may in a vision see a face of some divine/saintly being, or we may hear a Divine voice talking to us, and will know a Divine voice talking to us is God. When our heart-call is intense, and we do not give up, God will come. It is important that we remove from our mind all doubt that God will answer.\""}, "Kriya Yoga": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. The \"science\" of Kriya Yoga is the foundation of [0]'s teachings. An ancient spiritual practice, Kriya Yoga is \"union (yoga) with the Infinite through a certain action or rite (kriya).

No odour of decay emanated from Yogananda's body at any time...On another note, according to Catherine Wessinger, \"Yogananda's body was embalmed but emulsion was not applied to the skin.\"Because of two statements in Harry T. Rowe, Mortuary Director of the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California, where Yogananda's body was received, embalmed and interred's , some have questioned whether the term \"incorruptibility\" is appropriate. First, in Harry T. Rowe, Mortuary Director of the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California, where Yogananda's body was received, embalmed and interred's fourth paragraph Harry T. Rowe, Mortuary Director of the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California, where Yogananda's body was received, embalmed and interred wrote: \"For protection of the public health, embalming is desirable if a dead body is to be exposed for several days to public view.
