[0] later said that White violence killed four of Georgia-born Earl Little's brothers.Because of Ku Klux Klan threats, Georgia-born Earl Little's the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA) activities were said to be \"spreading trouble\" and the family relocated in 1926 to Milwaukee, and shortly thereafter to Lansing, Michigan. There, the family was frequently harassed by the Black Legion, a White racist group Georgia-born Earl Little accused of burning the family home in 1929.When [0] was six, Georgia-born Earl Little died in what has been officially ruled a streetcar accident, though Grenada-born Louise Helen Little (n\u00e9e Langdon) believed Georgia-born Earl Little had been murdered by the Black Legion. Rumors that White racists were responsible for Georgia-born Earl Little's were widely circulated and were very disturbing to [0] as a child. As an adult, [0] expressed conflicting beliefs on the question. After a dispute with creditors, Grenada-born Louise Helen Little (n\u00e9e Langdon) received a life insurance benefit (nominally $1,000 \u200d\u2014\u200cabout $19,000 in 2022) in payments of $18 per month; the issuer of another, larger policy refused to pay, claiming Grenada-born Louise Helen Little (n\u00e9e Langdon)'s had committed suicide. To make ends meet, Grenada-born Louise Helen Little (n\u00e9e Langdon) rented out part of Grenada-born Louise Helen Little (n\u00e9e Langdon)'s garden, and Grenada-born Louise Helen Little (n\u00e9e Langdon)'s sons hunted game.During the 1930s, white Seventh-day Adventists witnessed to the family; later on, Grenada-born Louise Helen Little (n\u00e9e Langdon) and Grenada-born Louise Helen Little (n\u00e9e Langdon)'s son Wilfred were baptized into the Seventh-day Adventist Church.

Several days later, after completing the Hajj rituals, [0] had an audience with Prince Faisal.[0] later said that seeing Muslims of \"all colors, from blue-eyed blonds to Black-skinned Africans,\" interacting as equals led [0] to see Islam as a means by which racial problems could be overcome.", "Visit to Cairo": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] had already visited the United Arab Republic (a short-lived political union between Egypt and Syria), Sudan, Nigeria, and Ghana in 1959 to make arrangements for a tour of Africa by Elijah Muhammad. After [0]'s journey to Mecca in 1964, [0] visited Africa a second time. [0] returned to the United States in late May and flew to Africa again in July. During these visits [0] met officials, gave interviews, and spoke on radio and television in Egypt, Ethiopia, Tanganyika, Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea, Sudan, Senegal, Liberia, Algeria, and Morocco.In Cairo, [0] attended the second meeting of the Organization of African Unity as a representative of the Organization of African Unity. By the end of this third visit, [0] had met with essentially all of Africa's prominent leaders; Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana, Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt, and Ahmed Ben Bella of Algeria had all invited [0] to serve in Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana, Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt, and Ahmed Ben Bella of Algeria's governments. After [0] spoke at the University of Ibadan, the Nigerian Muslim Students Association bestowed on [0] the honorary Yoruba name Omowale ('the son who has come home'). [0] later called bestowed [0]'s most treasured honor.[0] especially hated Mo\u00efse Tshombe of the Congo as an \"Uncle Tom\" figure. In a 1964 speech in New York, [0] called Mo\u00efse Tshombe of the Congo \"the worse African ever born\" and \"the man who in cold blood, cold blood, committed an international crime-murdered Patrice Lumumba\". Mo\u00efse Tshombe of the Congo's decision in 1964 to hire White mercenaries to put down the Simba rebellion greatly offended Malcolm, who accused White mercenaries of committing war crimes against the Congolese.", "France and United Kingdom": "[0] is our person to focus on. On November\u00a023, 1964, on [0]'s way home from Africa, [0] stopped in Paris, where [0] spoke in the Salle de la Mutualit\u00e9. After [0]'s return to the United States, [0] accused the United States of imperialism in Africa by supporting Tshombe and \"Tshombe's hired killers\" as [0] called the White mercenaries. [0] accused Tshombe and the American president Lyndon B. Johnson of \"...sleeping together. When [0] say sleeping together, [0] don't mean sleeping literally. But beyond sleeping, Tshombe and the American president Lyndon B. Johnson're in the same bed. the American president Lyndon B. Johnson is paying the salaries, paying the government, propping up the government, this murderer\".[0] expressed much anger about Operation Dragon Rouge, where the United States Air Force dropped in Belgian paratroopers into the city of Stanleyville, modern Kisangani, to rescue the White Belgian hostages from the Simbas. [0] maintained that there was a double standard when it came to White and Black lives, noting it was an international emergency when the lives of Whites were in danger, making Dragon Rouge necessary, but that nothing was done to stop the abuses of the Congolese at the hands of \"Tshombe's hired killers\". [0] charged that the \"Congolese have been massacred by White people for years and years\" and that \"the chickens have home to roast\".A week later, on November\u00a030, [0] flew to the United Kingdom. On December\u00a03 [0] took part in a debate at the Oxford Union Society. The motion was taken from a statement made earlier that year by U.S. presidential candidate Barry Goldwater: \"Extremism in the Defense of Liberty is No Vice; Moderation in the Pursuit of Justice is No Virtue\". [0] argued for the affirmative, and interest in a debate at the Oxford Union Society was so high that a debate at the Oxford Union Society was televised nationally by the BBC.In [0]'s address at the Oxford Union Society, [0] rejected the label of \"Black Muslim\" and instead focused on being a Muslim who happened to be Black, which reflected [0]'s conversion to Sunni Islam. [0] only mentioned [0]'s religion twice during [0]'s the Oxford Union Society speech, which was part of [0]'s effort to defuse [0]'s image as an \"angry Black Muslim extremist\", which [0] had long hated. During the debate at the Oxford Union Society, [0] criticized the way the Anglo-American press portrayed the Africa crisis, noting the Simbas were portrayed as primitive cannibalistic \"savages\" who engaged in every form of depravity imaginable while Tshombe and the White mercenaries were portrayed in a very favorable light with almost no mention of any atrocities on Tshombe and the White mercenaries's part.[0] charged that the Cuban \u00e9migr\u00e9 pilots hired by the CIA to serve as Tshombe's air force indiscriminately bombed Congolese villages and towns, killing women and children, but bombed was almost never mentioned in the media while the newspapers featured long accounts of the Simbas \"raping White women, molesting nuns\". Likewise, [0] felt the term mercenary was inappropriate, preferring the term \"hired killer\" and that Tshombe should not be described as a premier as [0] preferred the term \"cold-blooded murderer\" to describe Tshombe. [0] stated that what [0] regarded as the extremism of the Tshombe government was \"never referred to as extremism because the extremism of the Tshombe government is endorsed by the West, the extremism of the Tshombe government is financed by the United States, the extremism of the Tshombe government's made respectable by the United States, and that kind of extremism is never labelled as extremism\".[0] argued that kind of extremism was not morally acceptable \"since that kind of extremism's not extremism in defense of liberty\". Many in the audience at the Oxford Union Society were angered by [0]'s thesis and [0]'s support for the Simbas with one asking \"What sort of extremism would [0] consider the killing of missionaries?\". In response, [0] answered \"the killing of missionaries is an act of war. [0]'d call the killing of missionaries the same kind of extremism that happened when England dropped bombs on German cities and Germans dropped bombs on English cities\".On February\u00a05, 1965, [0] flew to the United Kingdom again, and on February\u00a08 [0] addressed the first meeting of the Council of African Organizations in London. The next day [0] tried to return to France, but was refused entry. On February\u00a012, [0] visited Smethwick, near Birmingham, where the Conservative Party had won the parliamentary seat in the 1964 general election. Smethwick, near Birmingham, where the Conservative Party had won the parliamentary seat in the 1964 general election had become a byword for racial division after the successful candidate, Peter Griffiths, was accused of using the slogan, \"If you want a nigger for a neighbour, vote Liberal or Labour.\" In Smethwick, near Birmingham, where the Conservative Party had won the parliamentary seat in the 1964 general election, [0] compared the treatment of ethnic minority residents with the treatment of Jews under Hitler, saying: \"[0] would not wait for the fascist element in Smethwick, near Birmingham, where the Conservative Party had won the parliamentary seat in the 1964 general election to erect gas ovens.\"", "Return to United States": "[0] is our person to focus on. After returning to the U.S., [0] addressed a wide variety of audiences. [0] spoke regularly at meetings held by MMI and the OAAU, and was one of the most sought-after speakers on college campuses.

Elijah Muhammad told the annual Savior's Day convention on February\u00a026 that \"[0] got just what [0] preached,\" but denied any involvement with the shocking and tragic assassination of your husband. \"We didn't want to kill [0] and didn't try to kill [0],\" Elijah Muhammad said, adding \"We know such ignorant, foolish teachings would bring [0] to [0]'s own end.\"Writer James Baldwin, who had been a friend of Malcolm\u00a0X's's, was in London when \"Writer James Baldwin, who had been a friend of Malcolm\u00a0X's heard the news of the shocking and tragic assassination of your husband. \"Writer James Baldwin, who had been a friend of Malcolm\u00a0X's responded with indignation towards the reporters interviewing him\"Writer James Baldwin, who had been a friend of Malcolm\u00a0X's, shouting, \"the reporters interviewing him did the shocking and tragic assassination of your husband!

After Malcolm X left the Nation of Islam in 1964, Malcolm X compared Malcolm X to a ventriloquist's dummy who could only say what Elijah Muhammad told him to saya ventriloquist's dummy who could only say what Elijah Muhammad told him to say .Malcolm X taught that Black people were the original people of the world, and that Whites were a race of devils who were created by an evil scientist named Yakub. the Nation of Islam believed that Black people were superior to White people and that the demise of the White race was imminent. When questioned concerning Malcolm X's statements that White people were devils, Malcolm X said: \"history proves the White man is a devil.\" \"Anybody who rapes, and plunders, and enslaves, and steals, and drops hell bombs on people\u00a0... anybody who does these things is nothing but a devil,\" Malcolm X said.Malcolm X said that Islam was the \"true religion of Black mankind\" and that Christianity was \"the White man's religion\" that had been imposed upon African Americans by African Americans's slave-masters. Malcolm X said that the Nation of Islam followed Islam as Islam was practiced around the world, but the Nation's teachings varied from those of other Muslims because the Nation's teachings were adapted to the \"uniquely pitiful\" condition of Black people in the United States. Malcolm X taught that Wallace Fard Muhammad, the founder of the Nation, was God incarnate, and that The Honorable Elijah Muhammad was Wallace Fard Muhammad, the founder of the Nation,'s Messenger, or Prophet.While the civil rights movement fought against racial segregation, Malcolm X advocated the complete separation of Blacks from Whites. the Nation of Islam proposed the establishment of a separate country for African Americans in the southern or southwestern United States as an interim measure until African Americans could return to Africa. Malcolm X suggested the United States owed reparations to Black people for the unpaid labor of Black people's ancestors. Malcolm X also rejected the civil rights movement's strategy of nonviolence, advocating instead that Black people should defend Black people.", "Independent views": "Malcolm X is our person to focus on. The common goal of 22 million Afro-Americans is respect as human beings.\u00a0... [0] can never get civil rights in America until [0]'s human rights are first restored. [0] will never be recognized as citizens there until [0] are first recognized as humans.\u00a0...Just as the violation of human rights of [0]'s brothers and sisters in South Africa and Angola is an international issue and has brought the racists of South Africa and Angola under attack from all other independent governments at the United Nations, once the miserable plight of 22 million Afro-Americans is also lifted to the level of human rights 22 million Afro-Americans's struggle then becomes an international issue and the direct concern of all other civilized governments. We can then take the racist American Government before the World Court and have the racists in it exposed and condemned as the criminals that the racists in it are.\u2014Malcolm\u00a0XAfter leaving the Nation of Islam, Malcolm X announced Malcolm X's willingness to work with leaders of the civil rights movement, though Malcolm X advocated some changes to leaders of the civil rights movement's policies. Malcolm X felt that calling the civil rights movement a struggle for civil rights would keep the civil rights movement within America while changing the focus to human rights would make the civil rights movement an international concern. the civil rights movement could then bring the civil rights movement's complaints before the United Nations, where Malcolm X said the emerging nations of the world would add the emerging nations of the world's support.Malcolm X argued that if the U.S. government was unwilling or unable to protect Black people, Black people should protect Black people. Malcolm X said that he and the other members of the OAAU were determined to defend he and the other members of the OAAU from aggressors, and to secure freedom, justice and equality \"by whatever means necessary\".Malcolm X stressed the global perspective Malcolm X gained from Malcolm X's international travels. Malcolm X emphasized the \"direct connection\" between the domestic struggle of African Americans for equal rights with the independence struggles of Third World nations. Malcolm X said that African Americans were wrong when African Americans thought of African Americans as a minority; globally, Black people were the majority.In Malcolm X's speeches at the Militant Labor Forum, which was sponsored by the Socialist Workers Party, Malcolm X criticized capitalism. After one such speech, when Malcolm X was asked what political and economic system Malcolm X wanted, Malcolm X said Malcolm X did not know, but that it was no coincidence the newly independent countries in the Third World were turning toward socialism. When a reporter asked Malcolm X what Malcolm X thought about socialism, Malcolm X asked whether socialism was good for Black people. When a reporter told Malcolm X socialism seemed to be, Malcolm X told a reporter: \"Then Malcolm X'm for socialism.\"Although Malcolm X no longer called for the separation of Black people from White people, Malcolm X continued to advocate Black nationalism, which he defined as self-determination for the African-American community. In the last months of Malcolm X's life, however, Malcolm X began to reconsider Malcolm X's support for Black nationalism, which he defined as self-determination for the African-American community after meeting northern African revolutionaries who, to all appearances, were White.After his Hajj, Malcolm X articulated a view of White people and racism that represented a deep change from the philosophy Malcolm X had supported as a minister of the Nation of Islam. In a famous letter from Mecca, Malcolm X wrote that Malcolm X's experiences with White people during his Hajj convinced Malcolm X to \"rearrange\" Malcolm X's thinking about race and \"toss aside some of [Malcolm X's] previous conclusions\". In a conversation with Gordon Parks, two days before Malcolm X's assassination, Malcolm X said:istening to leaders like Nasser, Ben Bella, and Nkrumah awakened Malcolm X to the dangers of racism.
