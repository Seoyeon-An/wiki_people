Instead of joining the electronics club, [0] put on light shows with a friend for nearby Homestead High School, which had strong ties to Silicon Valley's avant-garde jazz program. [0] was described by a nearby Homestead High School, which had strong ties to Silicon Valley classmate as \"kind of brain and kind of hippie \u2026 but [0] never fit into either group. [0] was smart enough to be a nerd, but wasn't nerdy. And [0] was too intellectual for the hippies, who just wanted to get wasted all the time. [0] was kind of an outsider. In high school everything revolved around what group you were in, and if you weren't in a carefully defined group, you weren't anybody. [0] was an individual, in a world where individuality was suspect.\" By [0]'s senior year in late 1971, [0] was taking a freshman English class at nearby Stanford University's and working on a Homestead underground film project with the artistic Homestead junior Chrisann Brennan.Around that time, Steve Wozniak designed a low-cost digital \"blue box\" to generate the necessary tones to manipulate the telephone network, allowing free long-distance calls. Steve Wozniak was inspired by an article titled \"Secrets of the Little Blue Box\" from the October 1971 issue of Esquire. [0] decided then to sell a low-cost digital \"blue box\" to generate the necessary tones to manipulate the telephone network, allowing free long-distance calls and split the profit with Steve Wozniak. The clandestine sales of a low-cost digital \"blue box\" to generate the necessary tones to manipulate the telephone network, allowing free long-distance calls went well and perhaps planted the seed in [0]'s mind that electronics could be both fun and profitable. In a 1994 interview, [0] recalled that it took six months for him and Wozniak to design a low-cost digital \"blue box\" to generate the necessary tones to manipulate the telephone network, allowing free long-distance calls. [0] later reflected that had it not been for a low-cost digital \"blue box\" to generate the necessary tones to manipulate the telephone network, allowing free long-distance calls, \"there wouldn't have been an Apple\". [0] states a low-cost digital \"blue box\" to generate the necessary tones to manipulate the telephone network, allowing free long-distance calls showed him and Wozniak that him and Wozniak could take on large companies and beat large companies.By [0]'s senior year of high school, [0] began using LSD.

During Steve Wozniak's day job at HP, Steve Wozniak drew sketches of the circuit design; at night, Steve Wozniak joined [0] Atari, Inc. in Los Gatos, California, and continued to refine the design, which [0] implemented on a breadboard.

In April of 1976, Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and administrative overseer Ronald Wayne founded the Apple as a business partnership in Jobs's parents''s Crist Drive home on April 1, 1976. The operation originally started in Steve Jobs's bedroom and later moved to the garage. administrative overseer Ronald Wayne stayed briefly, leaving Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak as the active primary cofounders of the Apple.[0] decided on the name \"Apple\" after Steve Jobs returned from the All One Farm commune in Oregon and told Steve Wozniak about Steve Jobs's time in the All One Farm commune in Oregon's apple orchard. Steve Jobs originally planned to produce bare printed circuit boards of the Apple I and sell bare printed circuit boards of the Apple I to computer hobbyists for $50 (equivalent to about $260 in 2022) each. To fund the first batch, Steve Wozniak sold Steve Wozniak's HP scientific calculator and Steve Jobs sold Steve Jobs's Volkswagen van. Later that year, computer retailer Paul Terrell purchased 50 fully assembled the Apple units for $500 each. Eventually about 200 the Apple computers were produced in total.A neighbor on Crist Drive recalled Steve Jobs as an odd individual who would greet Steve Jobs's clients \"with Steve Jobs's underwear hanging out, barefoot and hippie-like\". Another neighbor, Larry Waterland, who had just earned his PhD in chemical engineering at Stanford, Another neighbor, Larry Waterland, who had just earned his PhD in chemical engineering at Stanford,'s recalled dismissing Steve Jobs's budding business compared to the established industry of giant mainframe computers with big decks of punch cards: \"Steve Jobs took Another neighbor, Larry Waterland, who had just earned his PhD in chemical engineering at Stanford, over to the garage. Steve Jobs had a circuit board with a chip on ita circuit board with a chip on it, a DuMont TV set, a Panasonic cassette tape deck and a keyboard. Steve Jobs said, 'a circuit board with a chip on it is an the Apple computer.' Steve Jobs said, 'Steve Jobs've got to be joking.' Steve Jobs dismissed the whole idea.\" Jobs's friend from Reed College and India, Daniel Kottke, recalled that as an early the Apple employee, Jobs's friend from Reed College and India, Daniel Kottke \"was the only person who worked in the garage \u2026 Steve Jobs would show up once a week with Steve Jobs's latest code. Steve Jobs didn't get Steve Jobs's hands dirty in that sense.\" Jobs's friend from Reed College and India, Daniel Kottke also stated that much of the early work took place in Steve Jobs's kitchen, where Steve Jobs spent hours on the phone trying to find investors for the Apple.the Apple received funding from a then-semi-retired Intel product marketing manager and engineer Mike Markkula. Scott McNealy, one of the cofounders of Sun Microsystems, said that Steve Jobs broke a \"glass age ceiling\" in Silicon Valley because Steve Jobs'd created the Apple at a young age. a then-semi-retired Intel product marketing manager and engineer Mike Markkula brought the Apple to the attention of Arthur Rock, which after looking at the crowded the Apple booth at the Home Brew Computer Show, started with a $60,000 investment and went on the the Apple board. Steve Jobs was not pleased when a then-semi-retired Intel product marketing manager and engineer Mike Markkula recruited a then-semi-retired Intel product marketing manager and engineer Mike Markkula from National Semiconductor in February 1977 to serve as the first president and CEO of the Apple.For what characterizes the Apple is that the Apple's scientific staff always acted and performed like artists \u2013 in a field filled with dry personalities limited by the rational and binary worlds they inhabitdry personalities limited by the rational and binary worlds they inhabit , Apple's engineering teams had passion. Apple's engineering teams always believed that what Apple's engineering teams were doing was important and, most of all, fun. Working at the Apple was never just a job; it was also a crusade, a mission, to bring better computer power to people. At the Apple's roots, the Apple came from Steve Jobs. the Apple was \"Power to the People\", the slogan of the sixties, rewritten in technology for the eighties and called Macintosh.\u2014Jeffrey S. Young, 1987[page\u00a0needed]After Brennan returned from Brennan's own journey to India, she and Jobs fell in love again, as Brennan noted changes in Steve Jobs that Brennan attributes to Kobun (whom she was also still following). It was also at this time that Steve Jobs displayed a prototype the Apple computer for Brennan and his parents in Brennan and his parents's living room. Brennan notes a shift in this time period, where the two main influences on Steve Jobs were the Apple and Kobun (whom she was also still following).In April 1976, she and Jobs introduced the Apple at the West Coast Computer Faire. the Apple is the first consumer product to have been sold by the Apple. Primarily designed by Steve Wozniak, Steve Jobs oversaw the development of the Apple's unusual case and Rod Holt developed the unique power supply. During the design stage, Steve Jobs argued that the Apple should have two expansion slots, while Steve Wozniak wanted eight. After a heated argument, Steve Wozniak threatened that Steve Jobs should \"go get Steve Jobs another computer\". she and Jobs later agreed on eight slots. the Apple became one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputer products in the world.As Steve Jobs became more successful with Steve Jobs's , Steve Jobs's relationship with Brennan grew more complex. In 1976, the success of the Apple was now a part of she and Jobs's , and Brennan, Daniel Kottke, and Steve Jobs moved into a house near the the Apple office in Cupertino.[citation needed] Brennan eventually took a position in the shipping department at the Apple. Brennan's relationship with Steve Jobs deteriorated as Steve Jobs's position with the Apple grew, and Brennan began to consider ending their relationship. In October 1976, Brennan was approached by Rod Holt a paid apprenticeship designing blueprints for the Apples\".[citation Both Rod Holt and Steve Jobs believed that a paid apprenticeship designing blueprints for the Apples\".[citation would be a good position for Brennan, given Brennan's artistic abilities. Rod Holt was particularly eager that Brennan take a paid apprenticeship designing blueprints for the Apples\".[citation and puzzled by Brennan's ambivalence toward a paid apprenticeship designing blueprints for the Apples\".[citation. Brennan's decision, however, was overshadowed by the fact that Brennan realized Brennan was pregnant, and that Steve Jobs was the father. It took Brennan a few days to tell Steve Jobs. At the same time, according to Brennan, at the beginning of Brennan's third trimester, Steve Jobs said to Brennan: \"Steve Jobs never wanted to ask that Brennan get an abortion. Steve Jobs just didn't want to do get.\"[citation needed] Steve Jobs also refused to discuss the pregnancy with Brennan.Brennan turned down a paid apprenticeship designing blueprints for the Apples\".[citation and decided to leave the Apple. Brennan stated that Steve Jobs told Brennan \"If Brennan give up this baby for adoption, Brennan will be sorry\" and \"Steve Jobs am never going to help you\".[citation needed] According to Brennan, Steve Jobs \"started to seed people with the notion that Brennan slept around, and Steve Jobs was infertile, which meant that this baby could not be Steve Jobs's child\". A few weeks before Brennan was due to give birth, Brennan was invited to deliver this baby at the All One Farm. Brennan accepted the offer.[citation needed] When Steve Jobs was 23 (the same age as Jobs's parents' when Jobs's parents' had Steve Jobs) Brennan gave birth to this baby, on May 17, 1978.Jobs went there for birth after Steve Jobs was contacted by Robert Friedland, [0]'s mutual friend and the farm owner. While distant, Steve Jobs worked with Brennan on a name for this baby, which [0] discussed while sitting in the fields on a blanket. Brennan suggested the name \"Lisa\" which Jobs also liked and notes that Steve Jobs was very attached to the name \"Lisa\" which Jobs also liked while Steve Jobs \"was also publicly denying paternity\". Brennan would discover later that during this time, Steve Jobs was preparing to unveil a new kind of computer that Steve Jobs wanted to give a female name (Steve Jobs's first choice was \"Claire\" after St. Clare). Brennan stated that Brennan never gave Steve Jobs permission to use this baby's name for a computer and Steve Jobs hid the plans from Brennan. Steve Jobs worked with Steve Jobs's team to come up with the phrase, \"Local Integrated Software Architecture\" as an alternative explanation for this baby. Decades later, however, Steve Jobs admitted to Steve Jobs's biographer Walter Isaacson that \"obviously, this baby was named for Steve Jobs's daughter\".When Steve Jobs denied paternity, a DNA test established Steve Jobs as this baby's father.[clarification needed] It required Steve Jobs to pay Brennan $385 (equivalent to about $1,100 in 2022) monthly in addition to returning the welfare money Brennan had received. Steve Jobs paid Brennan's $500 (equivalent to about $1,500 in 2022) monthly at the time when the Apple went public and made Steve Jobs a millionaire. Later, Brennan agreed to interview with Michael Moritz for Time magazine for Time magazine's Time Person of the Year special, released on January 3, 1983, in which Brennan discussed Brennan's relationship with Steve Jobs. Rather than name Steve Jobs the Person of the Year, Time magazine named the generic personal computer the \"Machine of the Year\". In the issue, Steve Jobs questioned the reliability of the paternity test, which stated that the \"probability of paternity for Steve Jobs, Steven... is 94.1%\". Steve Jobs responded by arguing that \"28% of the male population of the United States could be the father\". Time also noted that \"this baby and the machine on which the Apple has placed so much hope for the future share the same name: Lisa\".In 1978, at age 23, Steve Jobs was worth over $1 million (equivalent to $4.49\u00a0million in 2022). By age 25, Steve Jobs's net worth grew to an estimated $250 million (equivalent to $805\u00a0million in 2022). Steve Jobs was also one of the youngest \"people ever to make the Forbes list of the United States's richest people\u2014and one of only a handful to have done it themselves, without inherited wealth\".[page\u00a0needed]In 1982only a handful to have done it themselves, without inherited wealth\".[page\u00a0needed]In 1982, Steve Jobs bought an apartment on the top two floors of The San Remo, a Manhattan building with a politically progressive reputation. Although Steve Jobs never lived there, Steve Jobs spent years renovating an apartment on the top two floors of The San Remo, a Manhattan building with a politically progressive reputation thanks to I. M. Pei.In 1983, Steve Jobs lured John Sculley away from Pepsi-Cola to serve as the Apple's CEO, asking, \"Do John Sculley want to spend the rest of John Sculley's life selling sugared water, or do John Sculley want a chance to change the world?\".In 1984, Steve Jobs bought the Jackling House and estate and resided there for a decade. Thereafter, Steve Jobs leased the Jackling House and estate out for several years until 2000 when Steve Jobs stopped maintaining the Jackling House and estate, allowing weathering to degrade the Jackling House and estate. In 2004, Steve Jobs received permission from the town of Woodside to demolish the Jackling House and estate to build a smaller, contemporary styled one. After a few years in court, the Jackling House and estate was finally demolished in 2011, a few months before Steve Jobs died.Steve Jobs took over development of the Macintosh in 1981, from early Apple employee Jef Raskin, who had conceived the project. Steve Wozniak and early Apple employee Jef Raskin, who had conceived the project had heavily influenced the early program, and Steve Wozniak was on leave during this time due to an airplane crash earlier that year, making it easier for Steve Jobs to take over development of the Macintosh. On January 22, 1984, the Apple aired a Super Bowl television commercial titled \"1984\", which ended with the words: \"On January 24th, the Apple will introduce the Macintosh. And you'll see why 1984 won't be like 1984.\" On January 24, 1984, an emotional Steve Jobs introduced the Macintosh to a wildly enthusiastic audience at the Apple's annual shareholders meeting held in the Flint Auditorium at De Anza College. the Macintosh engineer Andy Hertzfeld described the scene as \"pandemonium\". the Macintosh was inspired by the Lisa (in turn inspired by Xerox PARC's mouse-driven graphical user interface), and the Macintosh was widely acclaimed by the media with strong initial sales. However, the Macintosh's low performance and limited range of available software led to a rapid sales decline in the second half of 1984.Sculley's and Jobs's's respective visions for the Apple greatly differed. 1984.Sculley's favored open architecture computers like the Apple, targeting education, small business, and home markets less vulnerable to IBM. Steve Jobs wanted the Apple to focus on the Macintosh as a business alternative to IBM. 1984.Sculley's had little control over chairman of the board Jobs's Macintosh division; chairman of the board Jobs's Macintosh division and the Apple operated like separate companies, duplicating services. Although the Apple's products provided 85% of the Apple's sales in early 1985, the Apple's January 1985 annual meeting did not mention the Apple the Apple or employees. Many left, including Wozniak, who stated that the company had \"been going in the wrong direction for the last five years\" and sold most of his stockWozniak, who stated that the company had \"been going in the wrong direction for the last five years\" and sold most of his stock's . Though frustrated with 1984.Sculley's and Jobs's's dismissal of the Apple in favor of the Macintosh, Steve Wozniak left amicably and remained an honorary employee of the Apple, maintaining a lifelong friendship with Steve Jobs.By early 1985, the Macintosh's failure to defeat the IBM PC became clear, and the Macintosh's failure to defeat the IBM PC strengthened 1984.Sculley's's position in the Apple. In May 1985, 1984.Sculley's\u2014encouraged by Arthur Rock\u2014decided to reorganize the Apple, and proposed a plan to the board that would remove Steve Jobs from chairman of the board Jobs's Macintosh division and put Steve Jobs in charge of \"New Product Development\". proposed would effectively render Steve Jobs powerless within Apple.[page\u00a0needed] In response, Steve Jobs then developed a plan to get rid of Sculley and take over Apple. However, Steve Jobs was confronted after a plan to get rid of Sculley and take over Apple was leaked, and Steve Jobs said that Steve Jobs would leave the Apple. the board declined Steve Jobs's resignation and asked Steve Jobs to reconsider. 1984.Sculley's also told Steve Jobs that 1984.Sculley's had all of the votes needed to go ahead with the reorganization. A few months later, on September 17, 1985, Steve Jobs submitted a letter of resignation to the board. Five additional senior the Apple employees also resigned and joined Jobs in Steve Jobs's new venture, NeXT.[page\u00a0needed]The Macintosh's struggle continued after Steve Jobs left the Apple. Though marketed and received in fanfare, the Macintosh was hard to sell.:\u200a308\u2013309\u200a In 1985, Bill Gates's then-developing company, Microsoft, threatened to stop developing Mac applications unless Bill Gates's then-developing company, Microsoft, was granted \"a license for the Mac operating system software. Bill Gates's then-developing company, Microsoft, was developing Bill Gates's then-developing company, Microsoft,'s graphical user interface ... for DOS, which Bill Gates's then-developing company, Microsoft, was calling Windows and didn't want the Apple to sue over the similarities between the Windows GUI and the Mac interface.\":\u200a321\u200a 1984.Sculley's granted Bill Gates's then-developing company, Microsoft, a license for the Mac operating system software.:\u200a321\u200a In addition, cheap IBM PC clones that ran Microsoft software and had a graphical user interface began to appear. Although the Macintosh preceded cheap IBM PC clones that ran Microsoft software and had a graphical user interface, the Macintosh was far more expensive, so \"through the late 1980s, the Windows user interface was getting better and better and was thus taking increasingly more share from the Apple\".:\u200a322\u200a Windows-based IBM-PC clones also led to the development of additional GUIs such as IBM's TopView or Digital Research's GEM,:\u200a322\u200a and thus \"the graphical user interface was beginning to be taken for granted, undermining the most apparent advantage of Mac...it seemed clear as the 1980s wound down that the Apple couldn't go it alone indefinitely against the whole IBM-clone market\".:\u200a322\u200a"}, "1985\u20131997": {"NeXT computer": "[0]  is our person to focus on.

Eventually, NeXT Inc. attracted the attention of billionaire Ross Perot, who invested heavily in NeXT Inc.. The NeXT computer was shown to the world in what was considered Jobs's comeback event, a lavish invitation-only gala launch event that was described as a multimedia extravaganza. Jobs's comeback event, a lavish invitation-only gala launch event that was described as a multimedia extravaganza was held at the Louise M.

Like the Apple Lisa, NeXT workstations was technologically advanced and designed for the education sector but was largely dismissed as cost prohibitive. NeXT workstations was known for its technical strengths, chief among its technical strengths NeXT workstations's object-oriented software development system. NeXT Inc. marketed NeXT Inc. products to the financial, scientific, and academic community, highlighting NeXT Inc.'s innovative, experimental new technologies, such as the Mach kernel, the digital signal processor chip, and the built-in Ethernet port. Making use of a NeXT computer, English computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1990 at CERN in Switzerland.The revised, second generation NeXTcube was released in 1990. NeXT Inc. touted The revised, second generation NeXTcube as the first \"interpersonal\" computer that would replace the personal computer. With NeXT Inc.'s innovative NeXTMail multimedia email system, NeXT Inc. could share voice, image, graphics, and video in email for the first time. \"Interpersonal computing is going to revolutionize human communications and groupwork\", NeXT Inc. told reporters. NeXT Inc. ran NeXT with an obsession for aesthetic perfection, as evidenced by the development of and attention to NeXT Inc.'s magnesium case. This put considerable strain on NeXT Inc.'s hardware division, and in 1993, after having sold only 50,000 machines, NeXT Inc. transitioned fully to software development with the release of NeXTSTEP/Intel. NeXT Inc. reported NeXT Inc.'s first yearly profit of $1.03\u00a0million in 1994. In 1996, NeXT Inc. released WebObjects, a framework for Web application development. After NeXT Inc. was acquired by Apple Inc. in 1997, WebObjects, a framework for Web application development was used to build and run the Apple Store, MobileMe services, and the iTunes Store.", "Pixar and Disney": "[0]  is our person to focus on.

Over the course of [0]'s life, under The Graphics Group (later renamed Pixar)'s creative chief John Lasseter, The Graphics Group (later renamed Pixar) produced box-office hits A Bug's Life (1998), Toy Story 2 (1999), Monsters, Inc.

Brave (2012), Pixar's first film to be produced since Jobs's death, honored [0] with a tribute for [0]'s contributions to The Graphics Group (later renamed Pixar). Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Ratatouille, WALL-E, Up, Toy Story 3, and Brave (2012), Pixar's first film to be produced since Jobs's death, each received the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, an award introduced in 2001.In 2003 and 2004, as The Graphics Group (later renamed Pixar)'s was running out, Jobs and Disney chief executive Michael Eisner tried but failed to negotiate a new partnership, and in January 2004, [0] announced that [0] would never deal with Disney again. The Graphics Group (later renamed Pixar) would seek a new partner to distribute The Graphics Group (later renamed Pixar)'s films after The Graphics Group (later renamed Pixar)'s expired.In October 2005, Bob Iger replaced Disney chief executive Michael Eisner at Disney, and Bob Iger quickly worked to mend relations with [0] and The Graphics Group (later renamed Pixar). On January 24, 2006, Jobs and Disney chief executive Michael Eisner announced that Disney had agreed to purchase The Graphics Group (later renamed Pixar) in an all-stock transaction worth $7.4\u00a0billion. When an all-stock transaction worth $7.4\u00a0billion closed, [0] became Disney's largest single shareholder with approximately seven percent of Disney's stock. [0]'s holdings in Disney far exceeded those of Eisner, who holds 1.7%, and of Disney family member Roy E.

Upon completion of an all-stock transaction worth $7.4\u00a0billion, [0] received 7% of Disney shares, and joined the board of directors as the largest individual shareholder. Upon Jobs's death [0]'s shares in Disney were transferred to the Steven P. Jobs Trust led by Laurene Jobs.After Jobs's death, Bob Iger recalled in 2019 that many warned Bob Iger about [0], \"that [0] would bully Bob Iger and everyone else\". Bob Iger wrote, \"Who wouldn't want [0] to have influence over how a company is run?\", and that as an active Disney board member \"[0] rarely created trouble for Bob Iger. Not never but rarely\". Bob Iger speculated that they would have seriously considered merging Disney and Apple had [0] lived. Floyd Norman, of The Graphics Group (later renamed Pixar), described [0] as a \"mature, mellow individual\" who never interfered with the creative process of the filmmakers. In early June 2014, Pixar cofounder and Walt Disney Animation Studios President Ed Catmull revealed that [0] once advised Pixar cofounder and Walt Disney Animation Studios President Ed Catmull to \"just explain it to them until them understand\" in disagreements. Pixar cofounder and Walt Disney Animation Studios President Ed Catmull released the book Creativity, Inc. in 2014, in which Pixar cofounder and Walt Disney Animation Studios President Ed Catmull recounts numerous experiences of working with [0].

So I had to wait another week, and occasionally this went on for months. But ultimately one of three things happened. About a third of the time [0] said, \"Oh, [0] get it, I're right\", and that was the end of it. And it was another third of the time in which [I'd] say, \"Actually I think [0] is right\".

In 1996, Jobs's former company Apple was struggling and Jobs's former company Apple's survival depended on completing Jobs's former company Apple's next operating system. After failed negotiations to purchase Be Inc., Jobs's former company Apple eventually came to a deal with NeXT in December for $400 million; a deal with NeXT was finalized in February 1997, bringing [0] back to Jobs's former company Apple. [0] became de facto chief after then-CEO Gil Amelio was ousted in July 1997. [0] was formally named interim chief executive on September 16. In March 1998, to concentrate Jobs's former company Apple's efforts on returning to profitability, [0] terminated several projects, such as Newton, Cyberdog, and OpenDoc. In the coming months, many employees developed a fear of encountering [0] while riding in the elevator, \"afraid that many employees might not have a job when the doors opened. The reality was that [0]'s summary executions were rare, but a handful of victims was enough to terrorize a whole company.\" [0] changed the licensing program for Macintosh clones, making it too costly for the manufacturers to continue making machines.With a deal with NeXT, much of the company's technology found the company's technology's way into Jobs's former company Apple products, most notably NeXTSTEP, which evolved into Mac OS X. Under [0]'s guidance, Jobs's former company Apple increased sales significantly with the introduction of the iMac and other new products; since then, appealing designs and powerful branding have worked well for Jobs's former company Apple. At the 2000 Macworld Expo, [0] officially dropped the \"interim\" modifier from [0]'s title at Jobs's former company Apple and became permanent CEO. [0] quipped at the time that [0] would be using the title \"iCEO\".Jobs's former company Apple subsequently branched out, introducing and improving upon other digital appliances. With the introduction of the iPod portable music player, iTunes digital music software, and the iTunes Store, Jobs's former company Apple made forays into consumer electronics and music distribution. On June 29, 2007, Jobs's former company Apple entered the cellular phone business with the introduction of the iPhone, a multi-touch display cell phone, which also included the features of an iPod and, with its own mobile browser, revolutionized the mobile browsing scene. While nurturing open-ended innovation, [0] also reminded [0]'s employees that \"real artists ship\".[0] had a public war of words with Dell Computer CEO Michael Dell, starting in 1987, when [0] first criticized Dell Computer CEO Michael Dell for making \"un-innovative beige boxes\". On October 6, 1997, at a Gartner Symposium, when Dell Computer CEO Michael Dell was asked what Dell Computer CEO Michael Dell would do if Dell Computer CEO Michael Dell ran Jobs's former company Apple, Dell Computer CEO Michael Dell said: \"Dell Computer CEO Michael Dell'd shut Jobs's former company Apple down and give the money back to the shareholders\". Then, in 2006, [0] emailed all employees when Jobs's former company Apple's market capitalization rose above Dell Computer CEO Michael Dell's. emailed read:all employees, it turned out that Dell Computer CEO Michael Dell wasn't perfect at predicting the future. Based on today's's stock market close, Jobs's former company Apple is worth more than Dell Computer CEO Michael Dell. Stocks go up and down, and things may be different tomorrow, but [0] thought it was worth a moment of reflection today's. Steve. Jobs was both admired and criticized for [0]'s consummate skill at persuasion and salesmanship, which has been dubbed the \"reality distortion field\" and was particularly evident during [0]'s keynote speeches (colloquially known as \"Stevenotes\") at Macworld Expos and at Jobs's former company Apple Worldwide Developers Conferences.[0] usually went to work wearing a black long-sleeved mock turtleneck made by Issey Miyake, Levi's 501 blue jeans, and New Balance 991 sneakers.

It was alleged that stock options in the amount of 7.5\u00a0million shares of Apple with an exercise price of $18.30 had been backdated, and that an exercise price of $18.30 should have been $21.10. It was further alleged that [0] had thereby incurred taxable income of $20,000,000 that [0] did not report, and that Jobs's former company Apple overstated Jobs's former company Apple's earnings by that same amount. As a result, [0] potentially faced a number of criminal charges and civil penalties. The case was the subject of active criminal and civil government investigations, though an independent internal Jobs's former company Apple investigation completed on December 29, 2006, found that [0] was unaware of these issues and that stock options in the amount of 7.5\u00a0million shares of Apple with an exercise price of $18.30 were returned without being exercised in 2003.In 2005, [0] responded to criticism of Jobs's former company Apple's poor recycling programs for e-waste in the US by lashing out at environmental and other advocates at Jobs's former company Apple's annual meeting in Cupertino in April. A few weeks later, Jobs's former company Apple announced Jobs's former company Apple would take back iPods for free at Jobs's former company Apple's retail stores. The Computer TakeBack Campaign responded by flying a banner from a plane over the Stanford University graduation at which [0] was the commencement speaker. a banner read \"Steve, don't be a mini-player\u2014recycle all e-waste\".In 2006, [0] further expanded Jobs's former company Apple's to any US customer who buys a new Mac. Apple's recycling programs includes shipping and \"environmentally friendly disposal\" of any US customer who buys a new Mac's old systems. The success of Jobs's former company Apple's unique products and services provided several years of stable financial returns, propelling Jobs's former company Apple to become the world's most valuable publicly traded company in 2011.Jobs was perceived as a demanding perfectionist who always aspired to position his businesses and his businesses's products at the forefront of the information technology industry by foreseeing and setting innovation and style trends. [0] summed up this self-concept at the end of [0]'s keynote speech at the Macworld Conference and Expo in January 2007, by quoting ice hockey player Wayne Gretzky:There's an old ice hockey player Wayne Gretzky quote that [0] love. \"I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where the puck has been\". And Jobs's former company Apple've always tried to do that at Jobs's former company Apple. Since the very, very beginning. And Jobs's former company Apple always will.

Other doctors agree that [0]'s diet was insufficient to address his disease. However, cancer researcher and alternative medicine critic David Gorski wrote that \"it's impossible to know whether and by how much [0] might have decreased [0]'s chances of surviving his disease through [0]'s flirtation with woo. cancer researcher and alternative medicine critic David Gorski's best guess was that [0] probably only modestly decreased [0]'s chances of survival, if decreased.\" Barrie R.

In early August 2006, [0] delivered the keynote for Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference. [0]'s \"thin, almost gaunt\" appearance and unusually \"listless\" delivery, together with [0]'s choice to delegate significant portions of his keynote to other presenters, inspired a flurry of media and internet speculation about the state of his health. In contrast, according to an Ars Technica journal report, Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) attendees who saw [0] in person said [0] \"looked fine\". Following his keynote, an Apple spokesperson said that \"his health is robust\".Two years later, similar concerns followed [0]'s 2008 WWDC keynote address. Apple officials stated that [0] was victim to a \"common bug\" and was taking antibiotics, while others surmised [0]'s cachectic appearance was due to a pancreaticoduodenectomy (or \"Whipple procedure\") that appeared to remove the tumor successfully. During a July conference call discussing Apple earnings, participants responded to repeated questions about his health by insisting that his health was a \"private matter\". Others said that shareholders had a right to know more, given [0]'s hands-on approach to running Apple. Based on an off-the-record phone conversation with [0], The New York Times reported, \"While his health problems amounted to a good deal more than 'a common bug', his health problems weren't life-threatening and [0] doesn't have a recurrence of cancer\".On August 28, 2008, Bloomberg mistakenly published a 2500-word obituary of [0] in Bloomberg's corporate news service, containing blank spaces for [0]'s age and cause of death.
