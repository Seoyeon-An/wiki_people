[0] was born on May 12, 1907, in Hartford, Connecticut, the second of six children. Her parents were Thomas Norval Hepburn (1879\u20131962), a urologist at Hartford Hospital, and Katharine Martha Houghton Hepburn (1878\u20131951), a feminist campaigner. Her parents fought for social change in the United States: Thomas Norval Hepburn (1879\u20131962), a urologist at Hartford Hospital helped establish the New England Social Hygiene Association, which educated the public about venereal disease, while Katharine Martha Houghton Hepburn (1878\u20131951), a feminist campaigner headed the Connecticut Woman Suffrage Association and later campaigned for birth control with Margaret Sanger. As a child, [0] joined Katharine Martha Houghton Hepburn (1878\u20131951), a feminist campaigner on several \"Votes For Women\" demonstrations. six children were raised to exercise freedom of speech and encouraged to think and debate on any topic six children wished. Her parents were criticized by the community for Her parents's progressive views, which stimulated [0] to fight against barriers [0] encountered. [0] said [0] realized from a young age that [0] was the product of \"Her parents\", and credited [0] \"enormously lucky\" upbringing with providing the foundation for [0]'s success. [0] remained close with [0]'s family throughout [0]'s life.[0] was a tomboy who liked to call [0] Jimmy and cut [0]'s hair short. Thomas Norval Hepburn (1879\u20131962), a urologist at Hartford Hospital was eager for Thomas Norval Hepburn (1879\u20131962), a urologist at Hartford Hospital's to use six children's minds and bodies to the limit and taught six children to swim, run, dive, ride, wrestle, and play golf and tennis. Golf became a passion of [0]'s; [0] took daily lessons and became very adept, reaching the semi-final of the Connecticut Young Women's Golf Championship. [0] loved swimming in Long Island Sound, and took ice-cold baths every morning in the belief that \"the bitterer the medicine, the better the medicine was for you\". [0] was a fan of films from a young age and went to see one every Saturday night. [0] would put on plays and perform for [0]'s neighbors with friends and siblings for 50 cents a ticket to raise money for the Navajo people.In March 1921, Hepburn, 13, and her 16-year-old brother Tom were visiting New York, staying with a friend of Hepburn, 13, and her 16-year-old brother Tom's in Greenwich Village over the Easter break. On March 30, [0] discovered the body of her adored older brother dead from an apparent suicide. her adored older brother had tied a curtain tie around a beam and hanged her adored older brother. The Hepburn family denied it was suicide and maintained that her adored older brother's death must have been an experiment that had gone wrong. The incident made [0] nervous, moody, and suspicious of people. [0] shied away from other children, dropped out of Oxford School, and was tutored privately. For many years [0] used her adored older brother's birthday (November 8) as [0]'s own. It was not until [0]'s 1991 autobiography, Me: Stories of My Life, that [0] revealed [0]'s true birth date.In 1924, [0] was admitted to Bryn Mawr College. [0] initially agreed to attend Bryn Mawr College to satisfy [0]'s mother, who had studied there, but ultimately found attend to be fulfilling. attend was the first time [0] had been in school for several years, and [0] was self-conscious and uncomfortable with [0]'s classmates. [0] struggled with the scholastic demands of university, and once was suspended for smoking in [0]'s room. [0] was drawn to acting, but roles in college plays were conditional on good grades. Once [0]'s marks had improved, [0] began performing regularly. [0] performed the lead role in a production of The Woman in the Moon in [0]'s senior year, and the positive response a production of The Woman in the Moon received cemented [0]'s plans to pursue a theatrical career. [0] graduated with a degree in history and philosophy in June 1928."}, "Career": {"Breaking into theatre (1928\u20131932)": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] left university determined to become an actress. The day after graduating, [0] traveled to Baltimore to meet Edwin H. Knopf, who ran a successful stock theatre company. Impressed by [0]'s eagerness, Edwin H. Knopf, who ran a successful stock theatre company cast [0] in Edwin H. Knopf, who ran a successful stock theatre company's current production, The Czarina. [0] received good reviews for [0]'s small role, and the Printed Word described [0]'s performance as \"arresting\". [0] was given a part in the following week's show, but [0]'s second performance was less well received. [0] was criticized for [0]'s shrill voice, and so left Baltimore to study with a voice tutor in New York City.Edwin H. Knopf, who ran a successful stock theatre company decided to produce The Big Pond in New York, and appointed [0] the understudy to the leading lady. A week before opening, the leading lady was fired and replaced with [0], which gave [0] a starring role only four weeks into [0]'s theatre career. On opening night, [0] turned up late, mixed [0]'s lines, tripped over [0]'s feet, and spoke too quickly to be understood. [0] was immediately fired, and the leading lady rehired. Undeterred, [0] joined forces with the producer Arthur Hopkins and accepted the role of a schoolgirl in These Days. [0]'s Broadway debut came on November 12, 1928, at the Cort Theatre, but reviews for The Big Pond in New York were poor, and The Big Pond in New York closed after eight nights. the producer Arthur Hopkins promptly hired [0] as the lead understudy in Philip Barry's play Holiday. In early December, after only two weeks, [0] quit to marry Ludlow Ogden Smith, a college acquaintance. [0] planned to leave the theatre behind but began to miss the work and quickly resumed the understudy role in Holiday, which she held for six months.In 1929, [0] turned down a role with the Theatre Guild to play the lead in Death Takes a Holiday. [0] felt the lead in Death Takes a Holiday was perfect, but again, [0] was fired. [0] went back to the Theatre Guild and took an understudy role for minimum pay in A Month in the Country. In the spring of 1930, [0] joined the Berkshire Playhouse theater company in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. [0] left halfway through the summer season and continued studying with a drama tutor. In early 1931, [0] was cast in the Broadway production of Art and Mrs. Bottle. [0] was released from the understudy role in Holiday, which she held for six months after the playwright took a dislike to [0], saying \"[0] looks a fright, [0]'s manner is objectionable, and [0] has no talent\", but [0] was re-hired when no other actress could be found. the understudy role in Holiday, which she held for six months went on to be a small success.[0] appeared in a number of plays with a summer stock company in Ivoryton, Connecticut, and [0] proved to be a hit. During the summer of 1931, Philip Barry's asked [0] to appear in Philip Barry's's new play, The Animal Kingdom, alongside Leslie Howard. They began rehearsals in November, [0] feeling sure the lead in Death Takes a Holiday would make [0] a star, but Leslie Howard disliked [0] and again [0] was fired. When [0] asked Philip Barry's why [0] had been let go, Philip Barry's responded, \"Well, to be brutally frank, [0] weren't very good.\" This unsettled [0], but [0] continued to look for work. [0] took a small role in an upcoming play, but as rehearsals began, [0] was asked to read for the lead in the Greek fable The Warrior's Husband.the Greek fable The Warrior's Husband proved to be [0]'s breakout performance. Biographer Charles Higham states that the lead in the Greek fable The Warrior's Husband was ideal for [0], requiring an aggressive energy and athleticism, and [0] enthusiastically involved [0] with the lead in the Greek fable The Warrior's Husband's production. the lead in the Greek fable The Warrior's Husband opened March 11, 1932, at the Morosco Theatre on Broadway. [0]'s first entrance called for [0] to leap down a narrow stairway with a stag over [0]'s shoulder, wearing a short silver tunic. the lead in the Greek fable The Warrior's Husband ran for three months, and [0] received positive reviews. Richard Garland of the New York World-Telegram wrote, \"It's been many a night since so glowing a performance has brightened the Broadway scene.\"", "Hollywood success (1932\u20131934)": "[0] is our person to focus on. A scout for the Hollywood agent Leland Hayward spotted [0]'s appearance in The Warrior's Husband, and asked [0] to test for the part of Sydney Fairfield in the upcoming RKO film A Bill of Divorcement. Director George Cukor was impressed by what Director George Cukor saw: \"There was [0]\", Director George Cukor recalled, \"[0] was unlike anybody Director George Cukor'd ever heard.\" Director George Cukor particularly liked the manner in which [0] picked up a glass: \"Director George Cukor thought [0] was very talented in picked.\" Offered the part of Sydney Fairfield in the upcoming RKO film A Bill of Divorcement, [0] demanded $1,500 a week, a large amount for an unknown actress. Director George Cukor encouraged RKO to accept [0]'s demands and RKO signed [0] to a temporary contract with a three-week guarantee. RKO head David O. Selznick recounted that RKO head David O. Selznick took a \"tremendous chance\" in casting [0].[0] arrived in California in July 1932, at 25 years old. [0] starred in the upcoming RKO film A Bill of Divorcement opposite John Barrymore, but showed no sign of intimidation. Although [0] struggled to adapt to the nature of film acting, [0] was fascinated by the industry from the start. the upcoming RKO film A Bill of Divorcement was a success and [0] received positive reviews. Mordaunt Hall of The New York Times called her performance \"exceptionally fine ... [0]'s characterization is one of the finest seen on the screen\". The Variety review declared, \"Standout here is the smash impression made by [0] in [0]'s first picture assignment. [0] has a vital something that sets [0] apart from the picture galaxy.\" On the strength of the upcoming RKO film A Bill of Divorcement, RKO signed [0] to a long-term contract. Director George Cukor became a lifetime friend and colleague\u2014Director George Cukor and [0] made ten films together.[0]'s second film was Christopher Strong (1933), the story of an aviator and her affair with a married man. Christopher Strong (1933), the story of an aviator and her affair with a married man was not commercially successful, but [0]'s reviews were good. Regina Crewe wrote in the Journal-American that although her mannerisms were grating, \"her mannerisms compel attention, and her mannerisms fascinate an audience. [0] is a distinct, definite, positive personality.\" [0]'s third picture confirmed [0] as a major actress in Hollywood. For playing aspiring actress Eva Lovelace\u2014a role intended for Constance Bennett\u2014in Morning Glory, [0] won an Academy Award for Best Actress. [0] had seen the script on the desk of producer Pandro S. Berman and, convinced that [0] was born to play aspiring actress Eva Lovelace\u2014a role intended for Constance Bennett\u2014, insisted that aspiring actress Eva Lovelace\u2014a role intended for Constance Bennett\u2014 be [0]. [0] chose not to attend the awards ceremony\u2014as [0] would not for the duration of [0]'s career\u2014but was thrilled with an Academy Award. [0]'s success continued with the role of Jo in the film Little Women (1933). the film Little Women (1933) was a hit, one of the industry's biggest successes to date, and [0] won the Best Actress prize at the Venice Film Festival. the film Little Women (1933) was one of [0]'s personal favorites and [0] was proud of her performance, later saying, \"[0] defy anyone to be as good [as Jo] as [0] was\".By the end of 1933, [0] was a respected film actress, but [0] yearned to prove [0] on Broadway. Jed Harris, one of the most successful theatre producers of the 1920s, was going through a career slump. Jed Harris, one of the most successful theatre producers of the 1920s asked [0] to appear in the play The Lake, which she agreed to do for a low salary. Before [0] was given leave, RKO asked that [0] film Spitfire (1934). [0]'s role in Spitfire (1934) was Trigger Hicks, an uneducated mountain girl. Though Spitfire (1934) did well at the box office, Spitfire (1934) is widely considered one of [0]'s worst films, and [0] received poor reviews for Spitfire (1934). [0] kept a photo of [0] as Trigger Hicks, an uneducated mountain girl in [0]'s bedroom throughout [0]'s life to \"[keep] [0] humble\".the play The Lake, which she agreed to do for a low salary previewed in Washington, D.C., where there was a large advance sale. Jed Harris, one of the most successful theatre producers of the 1920s's poor direction had eroded [0]'s confidence, and [0] struggled with the performance. Despite this, Jed Harris, one of the most successful theatre producers of the 1920s moved the play The Lake, which she agreed to do for a low salary to New York without further rehearsal. the play The Lake, which she agreed to do for a low salary opened at the Martin Beck Theatre on December 26, 1933, and [0] was roundly panned by the critics. Dorothy Parker quipped, \"[0] runs the gamut of emotions all the way from A to B.\" Already tied to a ten-week contract, [0] had to endure the embarrassment of rapidly declining box office sales. Jed Harris, one of the most successful theatre producers of the 1920s decided to take the play The Lake, which she agreed to do for a low salary to Chicago, saying to [0], \"Jed Harris, one of the most successful theatre producers of the 1920s's , the only interest Jed Harris, one of the most successful theatre producers of the 1920s have in [0] is the money Jed Harris, one of the most successful theatre producers of the 1920s can make out of [0].\" [0] did not want to continue in a failing show, so [0] paid Jed Harris, one of the most successful theatre producers of the 1920s $14,000, most of [0]'s life savings, to close the play The Lake, which she agreed to do for a low salary instead. [0] later referred to Jed Harris, one of the most successful theatre producers of the 1920s as \"hands-down the most diabolical person [0] have ever met\", and claimed this experience was important in teaching [0] to take responsibility for [0]'s career.", "Career setbacks (1934\u20131938)": "[0] is our person to focus on. After the failure of Spitfire and The Lake, RKO cast [0] in The Little Minister (1934), based on a Victorian novel by James Barrie, in an attempt to repeat the success of Little Women. There was no such recurrence, and The Little Minister (1934), based on a Victorian novel by James Barrie was a commercial failure. The romantic drama Break of Hearts (1935) with Charles Boyer was poorly reviewed and also lost money. After three forgettable films, success returned to [0] with Alice Adams (1935), the story of a girl's desperation to climb the social ladder. [0] loved the book and was delighted to be offered the role. Alice Adams (1935), the story of a girl's desperation to climb the social ladder was a hit, one of [0]'s personal favorites, and gave [0] [0]'s second Oscar nomination. [0] received the second most votes, after winner Bette Davis.Given the choice of [0]'s next feature, [0] decided to star in George Cukor's new project, Sylvia Scarlett (1935), which paired [0] for the first time with Cary Grant. [0]'s hair was cut short for the part, as her character masquerades as a boy for much of Alice Adams (1935), the story of a girl's desperation to climb the social ladder. Critics disliked Alice Adams (1935), the story of a girl's desperation to climb the social ladder and Alice Adams (1935), the story of a girl's desperation to climb the social ladder was unpopular with the public. [0] next played Mary Stuart in John Ford's Mary of Scotland (1936), which met with a similarly poor reception. A Woman Rebels (1936) followed, a Victorian-era drama where her character defied convention by having a child out of wedlock. Quality Street (1937) also had a period setting, this time a comedy. Neither movie was popular with the public, which meant [0] had made four unsuccessful pictures in a row.Alongside a series of unpopular films, problems arose from [0]'s attitude. [0] had a difficult relationship with the press, with whom [0] could be rude and provocative. When asked if [0] had any children, [0] snapped back, \"Yes, [0] have five: two white and three colored.\" [0] would not give interviews and denied requests for autographs, which earned [0] the nickname \"Katharine of Arrogance\". The public was also baffled by [0]'s boyish behavior and fashion choices, and [0] became a largely unpopular figure. [0] sensed that [0] needed to leave Hollywood, so [0] returned east to star in a theatrical adaptation of Jane Eyre. a theatrical adaptation of Jane Eyre had a successful tour, but, uncertain about the script and unwilling to risk failure after the disaster of The Lake, [0] decided against taking a theatrical adaptation of Jane Eyre to Broadway. Towards the end of 1936, [0] vied for the role of Scarlett O'Hara in Gone with the Wind. Producer David O. Selznick refused to offer [0] the role of Scarlett O'Hara in Gone with the Wind because Producer David O. Selznick felt [0] had no sex appeal. Producer David O. Selznick reportedly told [0], \"Producer David O. Selznick can't see Rhett Butler chasing [0] for twelve years.[0]'s next feature, Stage Door (1937), paired [0] with Ginger Rogers in a role that mirrored [0]'s own life\u2014that of a wealthy society girl trying to make it as an actress. [0] was praised for [0]'s work at early previews, which gave [0]'s top billing over Ginger Rogers. Stage Door was nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards, but Stage Door was not the box-office hit RKO had hoped for. Industry pundits blamed [0] for the small profit, but RKO continued RKO's commitment to resurrecting [0]'s popularity. [0] was cast in Howard Hawks' screwball comedy Bringing Up Baby (1938), where [0] played a flighty heiress who loses a leopard while trying to woo a palaeontologist (Cary Grant). [0] approached the physical comedy of the film with confidence, and took tips on comedic timing from [0]'s co-star Walter Catlett. the film was acclaimed by critics, but the film was nevertheless unsuccessful at the box office. With the genre and Grant both hugely popular at the time, biographer A. Scott Berg believes the blame lay with moviegoers' rejection of [0].After the release of the film, the Independent Theatre Owners of America included [0] on a list of actors considered \"box office poison\". [0]'s reputation at a low, the next film RKO offered [0] was Mother Carey's Chickens, a B movie with poor prospects. [0] turned Mother Carey's Chickens, a B movie with poor prospects down, and instead opted to buy out [0]'s contract for $75,000. Many actors were afraid to leave the stability of the studio system at the time, but [0]'s personal wealth meant [0] could afford to be independent. [0] signed on for the film version of Holiday (1938) with Columbia Pictures, pairing [0] for the third time with Cary Grant, to play a stifled society girl who finds joy with her sister's fianc\u00e9a stifled society girl who finds joy with her sister's fianc\u00e9's . The comedy was positively reviewed, but The comedy failed to draw much of an audience, and the next script offered to [0] came with a salary of $10,000\u2014less than [0] had received at the start of [0]'s film career. Reflecting on this change in fortunes, Andrew Britton writes of [0], \"No other star has emerged with greater rapidity or with more ecstatic acclaim. No other star, either, has become so unpopular so quickly for so long a time.\"", "Revival (1939\u20131942)": "[0] is our person to focus on. Following this decline in [0]'s career, [0] took action to create [0]'s own comeback vehicle. [0] left Hollywood to look for a stage project, and signed on to star in Philip Barry's new play, The Philadelphia Story. Philip Barry's new play, The Philadelphia Story was tailored to showcase [0], with the character of socialite Tracy Lord incorporating a mixture of humor, aggression, nervousness, and vulnerability. Howard Hughes, [0]'s partner at the time, sensed that Philip Barry's new play, The Philadelphia Story could be [0]'s ticket back to Hollywood stardom and bought [0] the film rights before Philip Barry's new play, The Philadelphia Story even debuted on stage. Philip Barry's new play, The Philadelphia Story first toured the United States, to positive reviews, and then opened in New York at the Shubert Theatre on March 28, 1939. Philip Barry's new play, The Philadelphia Story was a big hit, critically and financially, running for 417 performances and then going on a second successful tour.Several of the major film studios approached [0] to produce the movie version of Barry's playPhilip Barry's new play, The Philadelphia Story. [0] chose to sell the film rights to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), Hollywood's number one studio, on the condition that [0] be the star. As part of sell [0] also received the director of [0]'s choice, George Cukor, and picked James Stewart and Cary Grant (to whom [0] ceded top-billing) as co-stars. Before filming began, [0] shrewdly noted, \"[0] don't want to make a grand entrance in the movie version of Barry's play. Moviegoers\u00a0... think [0]'m too la-di-da or something. A lot of people want to see [0] fall flat on [0]'s face.\" Thus the movie version of Barry's play began with Cary Grant knocking [0] flat on [0]'s backside. Berg describes how the character of socialite Tracy Lord was crafted to have audiences \"laugh at [0]'s enough that audiences would ultimately sympathize with [0]\", which [0] felt was crucial in \"recreating\" [0]'s public image. Philip Barry's new play, The Philadelphia Story was one of the biggest hits of 1940, breaking records at Radio City Music Hall. The review in Time declared, \"Come on back, [0], all is forgiven.\" Herb Golden of Variety stated, \"the movie version of Barry's play's [0]'s picture\u00a0... The perfect conception of all flighty, but characterful, Main Line socialite gals rolled into one, the story without [0] is almost inconceivable.\" [0] was nominated for [0]'s third Academy Award for Best Actress, and won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress while Cary Grant won Cary Grant's only Academy Award for Best Actor for Cary Grant's performance.[0] was also responsible for the development of [0]'s next project, the romantic comedy Woman of the Year about a political columnist and a sports reporter whose relationship is threatened by a political columnist's self-centered independence. The idea for the movie version of Barry's play was proposed to [0] in 1941 by Garson Kanin, who recalled how [0] contributed to the script. [0] presented the finished product to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), Hollywood's number one studio and demanded $250,000\u2014half for [0], half for the authors. [0]'s terms accepted, [0] was also given the director and co-star of [0]'s choice, George Stevens and Spencer Tracy. On Hepburn and Tracy's's first day on set together, [0] allegedly told Spencer Tracy \"[0]'m afraid [0]'m too tall for Spencer Tracy\" to which Spencer Tracy replied, \"Don't worry [0], Spencer Tracy'll soon cut [0] down to Spencer Tracy's size.\" It started a relationship on screen and off that lasted until Spencer Tracy's death in 1967 with Hepburn and Tracy's appearing in another eight films together. Released in 1942, the movie version of Barry's play was another success. Critics praised the chemistry between Hepburn and Tracy's, and, says Higham, noted [0]'s \"increasing maturity and polish\". The World-Telegram commended two \"brilliant performances\", and [0] received a fourth Academy Award nomination. During the course of the movie version of Barry's play, [0] signed a star contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), Hollywood's number one studio.", "Slowing in the 1940s (1942\u20131949)": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 1942, [0] returned to Broadway to appear in another Philip Barry play, Without Love, which was also written with the actress in mind. Critics were unenthusiastic about another Philip Barry play, Without Love, which was also written with the actress in mind, but with [0]'s popularity at a high, another Philip Barry play, Without Love, which was also written with the actress in mind ran for 16 sold-out weeks. MGM was eager to reunite Tracy and Hepburn for a new picture and settled on Keeper of the Flame (1942). A dark mystery with a propaganda message on the dangers of fascism, Keeper of the Flame (1942) was seen by [0] as an opportunity to make a worthy political statement. Keeper of the Flame (1942) received poor notices, but was a financial success, confirming the popularity of the Tracy\u2013[0] pairing.Since Woman of the Year, [0] had committed to a romantic relationship with Tracy and dedicated [0] to helping Tracy. [0]'s career slowed as a result, and [0] worked less for the remainder of the decade than [0] had done in the 1930s\u2014notably by not appearing on-stage again until 1950. [0]'s only appearance in 1943 was a cameo in the morale-building wartime film Stage Door Canteen, playing [0]. [0] took an atypical role in 1944, playing a Chinese peasant in the high-budget drama Dragon Seed. [0] was enthusiastic about the high-budget drama Dragon Seed, but the high-budget drama Dragon Seed met with a tepid response and [0] was described as miscast. [0] then reunited with Tracy for the film version of Without Love (1945), after which [0] turned down a role in The Razor's Edge to support Tracy through Tracy's return to Broadway. Without Love received poor reviews, but a new Tracy\u2013[0] picture was a big event and Without Love was popular on release, selling a record number of tickets over the Easter weekend in [0]'s next film was Undercurrent (1946), a film noir with Robert Taylor and Robert Mitchum that was poorly received. A fourth film with Tracy came in 1947: a drama set in the American Old West entitled The Sea of Grass. Similarly to Keeper of the Flame (1942) and Without Love, a lukewarm response from critics did not stop a drama set in the American Old West entitled The Sea of Grass from being a financial success both at home and abroad. 1947, [0] portrayed Clara Wieck Schumann in Song of Love. [0] trained intensively with a pianist for the role. By the time of Song of Love's release in October, [0]'s career had been significantly affected by [0]'s public opposition to the growing anti-communist movement in Hollywood. Viewed by some as dangerously progressive, [0] was not offered work for nine months and people reportedly threw things at screenings of Song of Love. [0]'s next film role came unexpectedly, as [0] agreed to replace Claudette Colbert only days before shooting began on Frank Capra's political drama State of the Union (1948). Tracy had long been signed to play the male lead, and so [0] was already familiar with the script and stepped up for Frank Capra's political drama State of the Union (1948). Critics responded positively to Frank Capra's political drama State of the Union (1948) and Frank Capra's political drama State of the Union (1948) performed well at the box-office.Tracy and Hepburn appeared onscreen together for a third consecutive year in the 1949 film Adam's Rib. Like Woman of the Year, the 1949 film Adam's Rib was a \"battle of the sexes\" comedy and was written specifically for Tracy and Hepburn by Tracy and Hepburn's friends Garson Kanin and Ruth Gordon.
