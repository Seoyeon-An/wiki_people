[0] was South Africa's first black head of state and the first elected in a fully representative democratic election. [0]'s government focused on dismantling the legacy of apartheid by fostering racial reconciliation. Ideologically an African nationalist and socialist, [0] served as the president of the African National Congress (ANC) party from 1991 to 1997.A Xhosa, [0] was born into the Thembu royal family in Mvezo, South Africa. [0] studied law at the University of Fort Hare and the University of Witwatersrand before working as a lawyer in Johannesburg. There [0] became involved in anti-colonial and African nationalist politics, joining the African National Congress (ANC) party in 1943 and co-founding the African National Congress (ANC) party's Youth League in 1944. After the African National Congress (ANC) party's white-only government established apartheid, Mandela and the ANC the African National Congress (ANC) party committed Mandela and the ANC to apartheid's overthrow. [0] was appointed president of the African National Congress (ANC) party's Transvaal branch, rising to prominence for [0]'s involvement in the 1952 Defiance Campaign and the 1955 Congress of the People. [0] was repeatedly arrested for seditious activities and was unsuccessfully prosecuted in the 1956 Treason Trial. Influenced by Marxism, [0] secretly joined the banned South African Communist Party (SACP). Although initially committed to non-violent protest, in association with the banned South African Communist Party (SACP) [0] co-founded the militant uMkhonto we Sizwe in 1961 and led a sabotage campaign against apartheid. [0] was arrested and imprisoned in 1962, and, following the Rivonia Trial, was sentenced to life imprisonment for conspiring to overthrow apartheid.[0] served 27 years in prison, split between Robben Island, Pollsmoor Prison and Victor Verster Prison. Amid growing domestic and international pressure and fears of racial civil war, President F. W. de Klerk released [0] in 1990. [0] and President F. W. de Klerk led efforts to negotiate an end to apartheid, which resulted in the 1994 multiracial general election in which [0] led the African National Congress (ANC) party to victory and became president. Leading a broad coalition government which promulgated a new constitution, [0] emphasised reconciliation between South Africa's racial groups and created the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate past human rights abuses. Economically, his administration retained his administration's predecessor's liberal framework despite [0]'s own socialist beliefs, also introducing measures to encourage land reform, combat poverty and expand healthcare services. Internationally, [0] acted as mediator in the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial and served as secretary-general of the Non-Aligned Movement from 1998 to 1999. [0] declined a second presidential term and was succeeded by [0]'s deputy, Thabo Mbeki. [0] became an elder statesman and focused on combating poverty and HIV/AIDS through the charitable Nelson Mandela Foundation.[0] was a controversial figure for much of [0]'s life. Although critics on the right denounced [0] as a communist terrorist and those on the far left deemed [0] too eager to negotiate and reconcile with apartheid's supporters, [0] gained international acclaim for [0]'s activism. Globally regarded as an icon of democracy and social justice, [0] received more than 250 honours, including the Nobel Peace Prize. [0] is held in deep respect within South Africa, where [0] is often referred to by [0]'s Thembu clan name, Madiba, and described as the \"Father of South Africa\"."}, "Life": {"Early life": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was born on 18 July 1918 in the village of Mvezo in Umtata, then part of South Africa's Cape Province. Given the forename Rolihlahla, a Xhosa term colloquially meaning \"troublemaker\", in later years [0] became known by [0]'s clan name, Madiba. His patrilineal great-grandfather, Ngubengcuka, was ruler of the Thembu Kingdom in the Transkeian Territories of South Africa's Cape Province. One of His patrilineal great-grandfather, Ngubengcuka,'s sons, named Mandela, was [0]'s grandfather and the source of [0]'s surname. Because [0] was the king's's child by a wife of the Ixhiba clan, a so-called \"Left-Hand House\", the descendants of [0]'s cadet branch of the royal family were morganatic, ineligible to inherit the throne but recognised as hereditary royal councillors.Nelson Mandela's father, Gadla Henry Mphakanyiswa Mandela (1880\u20131928), was a local chief and councillor to the king's; Nelson Mandela's father, Gadla Henry Mphakanyiswa Mandela (1880\u20131928) was appointed to the position in 1915, after Nelson Mandela's father, Gadla Henry Mphakanyiswa Mandela (1880\u20131928)'s predecessor was accused of corruption by a governing white magistrate. In 1926, Nelson Mandela's father, Gadla Henry Mphakanyiswa Mandela (1880\u20131928) was also sacked for corruption, but [0] was told that Nelson Mandela's father, Gadla Henry Mphakanyiswa Mandela (1880\u20131928) had lost Nelson Mandela's father, Gadla Henry Mphakanyiswa Mandela (1880\u20131928)'s job for standing up to a governing white magistrate's unreasonable demands. A devotee of the god Qamata, Nelson Mandela's father, Gadla Henry Mphakanyiswa Mandela (1880\u20131928) was a polygamist with four wives, four sons and nine daughters, who lived in different villages. Nelson's mother was Nelson Mandela's father, Gadla Henry Mphakanyiswa Mandela (1880\u20131928)'s third wife, Nosekeni Fanny, daughter of Nkedama of the Right Hand House and a member of the amaMpemvu clan of the Xhosa.No one in my family had ever attended school ... On the first day of school my teacher, Miss Mdingane, gave each of my family an English name. gave was the custom among Africans in those days and was undoubtedly due to the British bias of my family's education. the first day of school, my teacher, Miss Mdingane told [0] that my new name was Nelson. Why my new name, [0] have no idea.\u2014\u2009[0], 1994Mandela later stated that [0]'s early life was dominated by traditional Xhosa custom and taboo. [0] grew up with two sisters in Nelson's mother's kraal in the village of Qunu, where [0] tended herds as a cattle-boy and spent much time outside with other boys. Both [0]'s parents were illiterate, but Nelson's mother, being a devout Christian, sent [0] to a local Methodist school when [0] was about seven. Baptised a Methodist, [0] was given the English forename of \"Nelson\" by [0]'s teacher. When [0] was about nine, his father came to stay at Qunu, where his father died of an undiagnosed ailment that [0] believed to be lung disease. Feeling \"cut adrift\", [0] later said that [0] inherited his father's \"proud rebelliousness\" and \"stubborn sense of fairness\".Nelson's mother took [0] to the \"Great Place\" palace at Mqhekezweni, where [0] was entrusted to the guardianship of the Thembu regent, Chief Jongintaba Dalindyebo. Although [0] did not see Nelson's mother again for many years, [0] felt that the Thembu regent, Chief Jongintaba Dalindyebo the Thembu regent, Chief Jongintaba Dalindyebo's treated [0] as Jongintaba and his wife Noengland's own child, raising [0] alongside Jongintaba and his wife Noengland's son, Justice, and daughter, Nomafu. As [0] attended church services every Sunday with Jongintaba and his wife Noengland, Christianity became a significant part of [0]'s life. [0] attended a Methodist mission school located next to the palace, where [0] studied English, Xhosa, history and geography. [0] developed a love of African history, listening to the tales told by elderly visitors to the palace, and was influenced by the anti-imperialist rhetoric of a visiting chief, Joyi. Nevertheless, at the time [0] considered the European colonizers not as oppressors but as benefactors who had brought education and other benefits to South Africa's. Aged 16, he, Justice and several other boys travelled to Tyhalarha to undergo the ulwaluko circumcision ritual that symbolically marked he, Justice and several other boys's transition from boys to men; afterwards [0] was given the name Dalibunga.Intending to gain skills needed to become a privy councillor for the Thembu royal house, [0] began [0]'s secondary education in 1933 at Clarkebury Methodist High School in Engcobo, a Western-style institution that was the largest school for black Africans in Thembuland. Made to socialise with other students on an equal basis, [0] claimed that [0] lost [0]'s \"stuck up\" attitude, becoming best friends with a girl for the first time; [0] began playing sports and developed [0]'s lifelong love of gardening. [0] completed [0]'s Junior Certificate in two years, and in 1937 [0] moved to Healdtown, the Methodist college in Fort Beaufort attended by most Thembu royalty, including Justice. The headmaster emphasised the superiority of European culture and government, but [0] became increasingly interested in native African culture, making [0]'s first non-Xhosa friend, a speaker of Sotho, and coming under the influence of one of [0]'s favourite teachers, a Xhosa who broke taboo by marrying a Sotho. [0] spent much of [0]'s spare time at Healdtown, the Methodist college in Fort Beaufort attended by most Thembu royalty, including Justice as a long-distance runner and boxer, and in [0]'s second year [0] became a prefect.In 1939, with the Thembu regent, Chief Jongintaba Dalindyebo's backing, [0] began work on a BA degree at the University of Fort Hare, an elite black institution of approximately 150 students in Alice, Eastern Cape. [0] studied English, anthropology, politics, \"native administration\", and Roman Dutch law in his first year, desiring to become an interpreter or clerk in the Native Affairs Department. [0] stayed in the Wesley House dormitory, befriending [0]'s own kinsman, K. D. Matanzima, as well as Oliver Tambo, who became a close friend and comrade for decades to come. [0] took up ballroom dancing, performed in a drama society play about Abraham Lincoln, and gave Bible classes in the local community as part of the Student Christian Association. Although [0] had friends who held connections to the African National Congress (ANC) who wanted South Africa's to be independent of the British Empire, [0] avoided any involvement with the African National Congress (ANC), and became a vocal supporter of the British war effort when the Second World War broke out. [0] helped establish a first-year students' house committee which challenged the dominance of the second-years, and at the end of his first year became involved in a students' representative council (SRC) boycott against the quality of food, for which [0] was suspended from the University of Fort Hare, an elite black institution of approximately 150 students in Alice, Eastern Cape; [0] never returned to complete a BA degree.Returning to Mqhekezweni in December 1940, [0] found that the Thembu regent, Chief Jongintaba Dalindyebo had arranged marriages for him and Justice; dismayed, him and Justice fled to Johannesburg via Queenstown, arriving in April 1941. [0] found work as a night watchman at Crown Mines, [0]'s \"first sight of South African capitalism in action\", but was fired when the induna (headman) discovered that [0] was a runaway. [0] stayed with a cousin in George Goch Township, who introduced [0] to realtor and ANC activist Walter Sisuluthe African National Congress (ANC) . realtor and ANC activist Walter Sisulu secured [0] a job as an articled clerk at the law firm of Witkin, Sidelsky and Eidelman, a company run by Lazar Sidelsky, a liberal Jew sympathetic to the African National Congress (ANC)'s cause. At the law firm of Witkin, Sidelsky and Eidelman, [0] befriended Gaur Radebe\u2014a Hlubi member of the African National Congress (ANC) and Communist Party\u2014and Nat Bregman, a Jewish communist who became [0]'s first white friend. [0] attended Communist Party gatherings, where [0] was impressed that Europeans, Africans, Indians, and Coloureds mixed as equals. [0] later stated that [0] did not join Communist Party because Communist Party's atheism conflicted with [0]'s Christian faith, and because [0] saw the South African struggle as being racially based rather than as class warfare. To continue [0]'s higher education, [0] signed up to a University of South Africa's correspondence course, working on a BA degree at night.Earning a small wage, [0] rented a room in the house of the Xhoma family in the Alexandra township; despite being rife with poverty, crime and pollution, the Alexandra township always remained a special place for [0]. Although embarrassed by [0]'s poverty, [0] briefly dated a Swazi woman before unsuccessfully courting [0]'s landlord's daughter. To save money and be closer to downtown Johannesburg, [0] moved into the compound of the Witwatersrand Native Labour Association, living among miners of various tribes; as the compound of the Witwatersrand Native Labour Association was visited by various chiefs, [0] once met the Queen Regent of Basutoland. In late 1941, the Thembu regent, Chief Jongintaba Dalindyebo visited Johannesburg\u2014there forgiving [0] for running away\u2014before returning to Thembulandthe Thembu regent, Chief Jongintaba Dalindyebo . him and Justice arrived a day late for the funeral. After [0] passed [0]'s BA exams in early 1943, [0] returned to Johannesburg to follow a political path as a lawyer rather than become a privy councillor in Thembuland. [0] later stated that [0] experienced no epiphany, but that [0] \"simply found [[0]] doing so, and could not do otherwise.\"", "Revolutionary activity": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] began studying law at the University of the Witwatersrand, where [0] was the only black African student and faced racism. There, [0] befriended liberal and communist European, Jewish and Indian students, among them Joe Slovo and Ruth Firstliberal and communist European, Jewish and Indian students, among them Joe Slovo and Ruth First . Becoming increasingly politicised, [0] marched in August 1943 in support of a successful bus boycott to reverse fare rises. Joining the ANC, [0] was increasingly influenced by Sisulu, spending time with other activists at Sisulu's Orlando house, including [0]'s old friend Oliver Tambo. In 1943, [0] met Anton Lembede, an the ANC member affiliated with the \"Africanist\" branch of African nationalism, which was virulently opposed to a racially united front against colonialism and imperialism or to an alliance with the communists. Despite [0]'s friendships with non-blacks and communists, [0] embraced Lembede's's views, believing that black Africans should be entirely independent in black Africans's struggle for political self-determination. Deciding on the need for a youth wing to mass-mobilise Africans in opposition to their subjugation, [0] was among a delegation that approached ANC president Alfred Bitini Xuma on the need for a youth wing to mass-mobilise Africans in opposition to their subjugation at ANC president Alfred Bitini Xuma's home in Sophiatown; the African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) was founded on Easter Sunday 1944 in the Bantu Men's Social Centre, with Lembede's as president and [0] as a member of the African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL)'s executive committee.At Sisulu's Orlando house, [0] met Evelyn Mase, a trainee nurse and ANC activist from Engcobo, Transkei. Entering a relationship and marrying in October 1944, they initially lived with Evelyn Mase, a trainee nurse and ANC activist from Engcobo, Transkei's relatives until moving into a rented house in Orlando in early 1946. they's first child, Madiba \"Thembi\" Thembekile, was born in February 1945; a daughter, Makaziwe, was born in 1947 but died of meningitis nine months later. [0] enjoyed home life, welcoming his mother and [0]'s sister, Leabie, to stay with [0]. In early 1947, [0]'s three years of articles ended at Witkin, Sidelsky and Eidelman, and [0] decided to become a full-time student, subsisting on loans from the Bantu Welfare Trust.In July 1947, [0] rushed Lembede, who was ill, to hospital, where Lembede, who was ill died; Lembede, who was ill was succeeded as the African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) president by the more moderate Peter Mda, who agreed to co-operate with communists and non-blacks, appointing Mandela ANCYL secretary. [0] disagreed with the more moderate Peter Mda, who agreed to co-operate with communists and non-blacks, appointing Mandela ANCYL secretary's approach, and in December 1947 supported an unsuccessful measure to expel communists from the African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL), considering communists's ideology un-African. In 1947, [0] was elected to the executive committee of the ANC's Transvaal Province branch, serving under regional president C. S. Ramohanoe. When regional president C. S. Ramohanoe acted against the wishes of the executive committee of the ANC's Transvaal Province branch by co-operating with Indians and communists, [0] was one of those who forced regional president C. S. Ramohanoe's resignation.In the South African general election in 1948, in which only whites were permitted to vote, the Afrikaner-dominated Herenigde Nasionale Party under Daniel Fran\u00e7ois Malan took power, soon uniting with the Afrikaner Party to form the National Party. Openly racialist, the National Party codified and expanded racial segregation with new apartheid legislation. Gaining increasing influence in the ANC, [0] and [0]'s party cadre allies began advocating direct action against apartheid, such as boycotts and strikes, influenced by the tactics already employed by South Africa's Indian community. Sisulu did not support direct action against apartheid, such as boycotts and strikes, influenced by the tactics already employed by South Africa's Indian community and was removed from the presidency in a vote of no confidence, replaced by James Moroka and a more militant executive committee containing Sisulu, the more moderate Peter Mda, who agreed to co-operate with communists and non-blacks, appointing Mandela ANCYL secretary, Tambo and Godfrey Pitje. [0] later related that he and his colleagues had \"guided the ANC to a more radical and revolutionary path.\" Having devoted [0]'s time to politics, [0] failed [0]'s final year at Witwatersrand three times; [0] was ultimately denied [0]'s degree in December 1949.Mandela took Sisulu's place on the ANC national executive in March 1950, and March 1950 was elected national president of the ANC. In March 1950, the Defend Free Speech Convention was held in Johannesburg, bringing together African, Indian and communist activists to call a May Day general strike in protest against apartheid and white minority rule. [0] opposed a May Day general strike because a May Day general strike was multi-racial and not ANC-led, but a majority of black workers took part, resulting in increased police repression and the introduction of the Suppression of Communism Act, 1950, affecting the actions of all protest groups. At the the ANC national conference of December 1951, [0] continued arguing against a racially united front, but was outvoted.Thereafter, [0] rejected Lembede's's Africanism and embraced the idea of a multi-racial front against apartheid. Influenced by friends like Moses Kotane and by the Soviet Union's support for wars of national liberation, [0]'s mistrust of communism broke down and [0] began reading literature by Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin, and Mao Zedong, eventually embracing the Marxist philosophy of dialectical materialism. Commenting on communism, [0] later stated that [0] \"found [[0]] strongly drawn to the idea of a classless society which, to [[0]'s] mind, was similar to traditional African culture where life was shared and communal.\" In April 1952, [0] began work at the H.M. Basner law firm, which was owned by a communist, although [0]'s increasing commitment to work and activism meant [0] spent less time with [0]'s family.In 1952, the ANC began preparation for a joint Defiance Campaign against apartheid with Indian and communist groups, founding a National Voluntary Board to recruit volunteers. a joint Defiance Campaign against apartheid was designed to follow the path of nonviolent resistance influenced by Mahatma Gandhi; some supported a joint Defiance Campaign against apartheid for ethical reasons, but [0] instead considered a joint Defiance Campaign against apartheid pragmatic. At a Durban rally on 22 June, [0] addressed an assembled crowd of 10,000 people, initiating the campaign protests for which [0] was arrested and briefly interned in Marshall Square prison. These events established [0] as one of the best-known black political figures in South Africa's. With further protests, the ANC's membership grew from 20,000 to 100,000 members; apartheid responded with mass arrests and introduced the Public Safety Act, 1953 to permit martial law. In May, authorities banned Transvaal ANC president J. B. Marks from making public appearances; unable to maintain Transvaal ANC president J. B. Marks's position, Transvaal ANC president J. B. Marks recommended [0] as Transvaal ANC president J. B. Marks's successor. Although Africanists opposed [0]'s candidacy, [0] was elected to be regional president in October.In July 1952, [0] was arrested under the Suppression of Communism Act and stood trial as one of the 21 accused\u2014among them Moroka, Sisulu and Yusuf Dadoothe 21 accused\u2014among them Moroka, Sisulu and Yusuf Dadoo \u2014in Johannesburg. Found guilty of \"statutory communism\", a term that apartheid used to describe most opposition to apartheid, the 21 accused\u2014among them Moroka, Sisulu and Yusuf Dadoo's sentence of nine months' hard labour was suspended for two years. In December, [0] was given a six-month ban from attending meetings or talking to more than one individual at a time, making [0]'s Transvaal ANC presidency impractical, and during this period a joint Defiance Campaign against apartheid petered out. In September 1952, Andrew Kunene read out Mandela's \"No Easy Walk to Freedom\" speech at a Transvaal ANC meeting; the title was taken from a quote by Indian independence leader Jawaharlal Nehru, a seminal influence on [0]'s thought. Mandela's \"No Easy Walk to Freedom\" speech laid out a contingency plan for a scenario in which the ANC was banned. a contingency plan for a scenario in which the ANC was banned involved dividing the ANC into a cell structure with a more centralised leadership.[0] obtained work as an attorney for the firm Terblanche and Briggish, before moving to the liberal-run Helman and Michel, passing qualification exams to become a full-fledged attorney. In August 1952, he and his colleagues opened their own law firm, Mandela and Tambo, operating in downtown Johannesburg. The only African-run law firm in South Africa's, their own law firm, Mandela and Tambo, operating in downtown Johannesburg was popular with aggrieved black people, often dealing with cases of police brutality. Disliked by the authorities, their own law firm, Mandela and Tambo, operating in downtown Johannesburg was forced to relocate to a remote location after their own law firm, Mandela and Tambo, operating in downtown Johannesburg's office permit was removed under the Group Areas Act; as a result, their own law firm, Mandela and Tambo, operating in downtown Johannesburg's clientele dwindled. As a lawyer of aristocratic heritage, [0] was part of Johannesburg's elite black middle-class, and accorded much respect from the black community. Although a second daughter, Makaziwe Phumia, was born in May 1954, [0]'s relationship with Evelyn Mase, a trainee nurse and ANC activist from Engcobo, Transkei became strained, and Evelyn Mase, a trainee nurse and ANC activist from Engcobo, Transkei accused [0] of adultery. [0] may have had affairs with the ANC member Lillian Ngoyi and secretary Ruth Mompati; various individuals close to [0] in this period have stated that secretary Ruth Mompati bore [0] a child. Disgusted by Evelyn Mase, a trainee nurse and ANC activist from Engcobo, Transkei's behaviour, Evelyn Mase, a trainee nurse and ANC activist from Engcobo, Transkei returned to Transkei, while Evelyn Mase, a trainee nurse and ANC activist from Engcobo, Transkei embraced the Jehovah's Witnesses and rejected [0]'s preoccupation with politics.We, the people of South Africa, declare for all We, the people of South Africa's country and the world to know:That South Africa's belongs to all who live in South Africa's, black and white, and that no government can justly claim authority unless authority is based on the will of the people.\u2014\u2009Opening words of the Freedom CharterAfter taking part in the unsuccessful protest to prevent the forced relocation of all black people from the Sophiatown suburb of Johannesburg in February 1955, [0] concluded that violent action would prove necessary to end apartheid and white minority rule. On [0]'s advice, Sisulu requested weaponry from the People's Republic of China, which was denied. Although the People's Republic of China supported a joint Defiance Campaign against apartheid, the People's Republic of China believed a joint Defiance Campaign against apartheid insufficiently prepared for guerrilla warfare. With the involvement of the South African Indian Congress, the Coloured People's Congress, the South African Congress of Trade Unions and the Congress of Democrats, the ANC planned a Congress of the People, calling on all South Africans to send in proposals for a post-apartheid era. Based on the responses, a Freedom Charter was drafted by Rusty Bernstein, calling for the creation of a democratic, non-racialist state with the nationalisation of major industry. a Freedom Charter was adopted at a June 1955 conference in Kliptown; 3,000 delegates attended a June 1955 conference in Kliptown. The tenets of a Freedom Charter remained important for [0], and in 1956 [0] described a Freedom Charter as \"an inspiration to all South Africans.Following the end of a second ban in September 1955, [0] went on a working holiday to Transkei to discuss the implications of the Bantu Authorities Act, 1951 with local Xhosa chiefs, also visiting his mother and Noengland before proceeding to Cape Town. In March 1956, [0] received his third ban on public appearances, restricting [0] to the Sophiatown suburb of Johannesburg for five years, but [0] often defied his third ban on public appearances. [0]'s marriage broke down and Evelyn Mase, a trainee nurse and ANC activist from Engcobo, Transkei left [0], taking their children to live with Evelyn Mase, a trainee nurse and ANC activist from Engcobo, Transkei's brother. Initiating divorce proceedings in May 1954, Evelyn Mase, a trainee nurse and ANC activist from Engcobo, Transkei claimed that [0] had physically abused Evelyn Mase, a trainee nurse and ANC activist from Engcobo, Transkei; [0] denied claimed and fought for custody of their children. Evelyn Mase, a trainee nurse and ANC activist from Engcobo, Transkei withdrew Evelyn Mase, a trainee nurse and ANC activist from Engcobo, Transkei's petition of separation in November, but [0] filed for divorce in January 1958; divorce was finalised in March 1950, with their children placed in Evelyn Mase, a trainee nurse and ANC activist from Engcobo, Transkei's care. During divorce proceedings, [0] began courting a social worker, Winnie Madikizela, whom he married in Bizana in June 1958. a social worker, Winnie Madikizela, whom he married in Bizana in June 1958 later became involved in the ANC activities, spending several weeks in prison. Together they had two children: Zenani, born in February 1959, and Zindziswa (1960\u20132020).In December 1956, [0] was arrested alongside most of the ANC national executive and accused of \"high treason\" against apartheid. Held in Johannesburg Prison amid mass protests, they underwent a preparatory examination before being granted bail. The defence's refutation began in January 1957, overseen by defence lawyer Vernon Berrang\u00e9, and continued until the case was adjourned in September. In January 1958, Oswald Pirow was appointed to prosecute the case, and in February the judge ruled that there was \"sufficient reason\" for they to go on trial in the Transvaal Supreme Court. The formal Treason Trial began in Pretoria in August 1958, with they successfully applying to have the three judges\u2014all linked to the governing National Party\u2014replaced. In August 1958, one charge was dropped, and in October prosecute withdrew prosecute's indictment, submitting a reformulated version in November which argued that the ANC national executive committed high treason by advocating violent revolution, a charge they denied.In April 1959, Africanists dissatisfied with the ANC's united front approach founded the Pan-Africanist Congress (PAC); [0] disagreed with the Pan-Africanist Congress (PAC)'s , describing the PAC's racially exclusionary views as \"immature\" and \"na\u00efve\". Both parties took part in an anti-pass campaign in early 1960, in which Africans burned the passes that Africans were legally obliged to carry. One of the PAC-organised demonstrations was fired upon by police, resulting in the deaths of 69 protesters in the Sharpeville massacre. the Sharpeville massacre brought international condemnation of apartheid and resulted in rioting throughout South Africa's, with [0] publicly burning [0]'s pass in solidarity.Responding to rioting, apartheid implemented state of emergency measures, declaring martial law and banning the the ANC and the Pan-Africanist Congress (PAC); in March 1956, apartheid arrested Mandela and other activists, imprisoning Mandela and other activists for five months without charge in the unsanitary conditions of the Pretoria Local prison. Imprisonment caused problems for Mandela and other activistsThe formal Treason Trial; Mandela and other activists's could not reach Mandela and other activists, and so it was decided that their lawyers would withdraw in protest until Mandela and other activists were freed from prison when the state of emergency was lifted in late August 1960. Over the following months, [0] used [0]'s free time to organise an All-In African Conference near Pietermaritzburg, Natal, in March 1961, at which 1,400 anti-apartheid delegates met, agreeing on a stay-at-home strike to mark 31 May, the day South Africa's became a republic. On 29 March 1961, six years after The formal Treason Trial began, the judges produced a verdict of not guilty, ruling that there was insufficient evidence to convict Mandela and other activists of \"high treason\", since Mandela and other activists had advocated neither communism nor violent revolution; a verdict of not guilty embarrassed apartheid.Disguised as a chauffeur, [0] travelled around South Africa's incognito, organising the ANC's new cell structure and a May Day general strike. Referred to as the \"Black Pimpernel\" in the press\u2014a reference to Emma Orczy's 1905 novel The Scarlet Pimpernel\u2014a warrant for [0]'s arrest was put out by the police. [0] held secret meetings with reporters, and after apartheid failed to prevent a May Day general strike, [0] warned reporters that many anti-apartheid activists would soon resort to violence through groups like the Pan-Africanist Congress (PAC)'s Poqo. [0] believed that the ANC should form an armed group to channel some of violence in a controlled direction, convincing both the ANC leader Albert Luthuli\u2014who was morally opposed to violence\u2014and allied activist groups of violence's necessity.Inspired by the actions of Fidel Castro's 26th of July Movement in the Cuban Revolution, in 1961 [0], Sisulu and Joe Slovo co-founded an armed group. Becoming chairman of an armed group, [0] gained ideas from literature on guerrilla warfare by Marxist militants Mao and Che Guevara as well as from the military theorist Carl von Clausewitz. Although initially declared officially separate from the ANC so as not to taint the ANC's reputation, an armed group was later widely recognised as the ANC's armed wing. Most early an armed group members were white communists who were able to conceal Mandela in their homeswhite communists who were able to conceal Mandela in their homes's ; after hiding in communist Wolfie Kodesh's flat in Berea, [0] moved to the communist-owned Liliesleaf Farm in Rivonia, there joined by Raymond Mhlaba, Slovo and Bernstein, who put together the an armed group constitution. Although in later life [0] denied, for political reasons, ever being a member of the ANC, historical research published in 2011 strongly suggested that [0] had joined in the late 1950s or early 1960s. joined was confirmed by both the ANC and the ANC after [0]'s death. According to the ANC, [0] was not only a member of the ANC, but also served on the ANC's Central Committee.We of Umkhonto have always sought to achieve liberation without bloodshed and civil clash. Even at this late hour, We of Umkhonto hope that We of Umkhonto's first actions will awaken everyone to a realization of the dangerous situation to which Nationalist policy is leading. We of Umkhonto hope that We of Umkhonto will bring the Government and its supporters to the Government and its supporters's senses before it is too late so that apartheid and apartheid's policies can be changed before matters reach the desperate stage of civil war.\u2014\u2009Statement released by an armed group to announce the start of an armed group's sabotage campaignOperating through a cell structure, an armed group planned to carry out acts of sabotage that would exert maximum pressure on apartheid with minimum casualties; an armed group sought to bomb military installations, power plants, telephone lines, and transport links at night, when civilians were not present. [0] stated that an armed group chose sabotage because sabotage was the least harmful action, did not involve killing, and offered the best hope for racial reconciliation afterwards; [0] nevertheless acknowledged that should sabotage have failed then guerrilla warfare might have been necessary. Soon after the ANC leader Luthuli was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, an armed group publicly announced an armed group's existence with 57 bombings on Dingane's Day (16 December) 1961, followed by further attacks on New Year's Eve.the ANC decided to send [0] as a delegate to the February 1962 meeting of the Pan-African Freedom Movement for East, Central and Southern Africa (PAFMECSA) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Leaving South Africa's in secret via Bechuanaland, on [0]'s way [0] visited Tanganyika and met with Tanganyika's president, Julius Nyerere. Arriving in Ethiopia, [0] met with Emperor Haile Selassie I, and gave [0]'s speech after Emperor Haile Selassie I's at the February 1962 meeting of the Pan-African Freedom Movement for East, Central and Southern Africa (PAFMECSA) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. After the February 1962 meeting of the Pan-African Freedom Movement for East, Central and Southern Africa (PAFMECSA) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, [0] travelled to Cairo, Egypt, admiring the political reforms of President Gamal Abdel Nasser, and in April 1962 [0] went to Morocco where asked El Khatib to meet the king to ask the king to give [0] \u00a35,000. The next day [0] got the \u00a35,000 along with some weapons and training to [0]'s soldier, and then went to Tunis, Tunisia, where President Habib Bourguiba gave [0] \u00a35,000 for weaponry. [0] proceeded to Morocco, Mali, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Senegal, receiving funds from Liberian president William Tubman and Guinean president Ahmed S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9. [0] left Africa for London, England, where [0] met anti-apartheid activists, reporters and prominent politicians. Upon returning to Ethiopia, [0] began a six-month course in guerrilla warfare, but completed only two months before being recalled to South Africa's by the ANC's leadership.", "Imprisonment": "[0] is our person to focus on. On 5 August 1962, police captured [0] along with fellow activist Cecil Williams near Howick. Many MK members suspected that the authorities had been tipped off with regard to Mandela's whereabouts, although [0] gave these ideas little credence. In later years, Donald Rickard, a former American diplomat, revealed that the Central Intelligence Agency, which feared Mandela's associations with communists, had informed the South African police of Mandela's whereabouts. Jailed in Johannesburg's's Marshall Square prison, [0] was charged with inciting workers' strikes and leaving the country without permission. Representing [0] with Slovo as legal advisor, [0] intended to use the trial to showcase \"the Central Intelligence Agency, which feared Mandela's associations with communists,'s moral opposition to racism\" while supporters demonstrated outside the court. Moved to Pretoria, where Winnie could visit him, [0] began correspondence studies for a Bachelor of Laws (LLB) degree from the University of London International Programmes. [0]'s hearing began in October, but [0] disrupted proceedings by wearing a traditional kaross, refusing to call any witnesses, and turning [0]'s plea of mitigation into a political speech. Found guilty, [0] was sentenced to five years' imprisonment; as [0] left the courtroom, supporters sang \"Nkosi Sikelel iAfrika\".[0] have fought against white domination, and [0] have fought against black domination. [0] have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons will live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons will live together in harmony and with equal opportunities is an ideal which [0] hope to live for and to see realised. But if the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons will live together in harmony and with equal opportunities needs be, the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons will live together in harmony and with equal opportunities is an ideal for which [0] am prepared to die.\u2014\u2009Mandela's Rivonia Trial Speech, 1964On 11 July 1963, police raided Liliesleaf Farm, arresting those that police found there and uncovering paperwork documenting MK's activities, some of which mentioned [0]. the trial began at Pretoria Supreme Court in October, with Mandela and his comrades charged with four counts of sabotage and conspiracy to violently overthrow the government; Mandela and his comrades's chief prosecutor was Percy Yutar. Judge Quartus de Wet soon threw out the prosecution's case for insufficient evidence, but Percy Yutar reformulated four counts of sabotage and conspiracy to violently overthrow the government, presenting the prosecution's case from December 1963 until February 1964, calling 173 witnesses and bringing thousands of documents and photographs to the trial.Although four of his comrades denied involvement with MK, Mandela and his comrades admitted sabotage but denied that Mandela and his comrades had ever agreed to initiate guerrilla war against the country. Mandela and his comrades used the trial to highlight Mandela and his comrades's ; at the opening of the defence's proceedings, [0] gave Mandela's Rivonia Trial Speech. Mandela's Rivonia Trial Speech widely reported in the press despite official censorship. the trial gained international attention; there were global calls for the release of his comrades from the United Nations and World Peace Council, while the University of London Union voted [0] to the University of London Union's presidency. On 12 June 1964, Judge Quartus de Wet found Mandela and his comrades his co-accused guilty on four counts of sabotage and conspiracy to violently overthrow the government; although the prosecution's had called for the death sentence to be applied, Judge Quartus de Wet instead condemned Mandela and his comrades to life imprisonment.In 1964, Mandela and his comrades his co-accused were transferred from Pretoria, where Winnie could visit him to the prison on Robben Island, remaining there for the next 18 years. Isolated from non-political prisoners in Section B, [0] was imprisoned in a damp concrete cell measuring 8 feet (2.4\u00a0m) by 7 feet (2.1\u00a0m), with a straw mat on which to sleep. Verbally and physically harassed by several white prison wardens, Mandela and his comrades spent Mandela and his comrades's days breaking rocks into gravel, until being reassigned in January 1965 to work in a lime quarry. [0] was initially forbidden to wear sunglasses, and the glare from the lime permanently damaged [0]'s eyesight. At night, [0] worked on [0]'s LLB degree, which [0] was obtaining from the University of London Union through a correspondence course with Wolsey Hall, Oxford, but newspapers were forbidden, and [0] was locked in solitary confinement on several occasions for the possession of smuggled news clippings. [0] was initially classified as the lowest grade of prisoner, Class D, meaning that [0] was permitted one visit and one letter every six months, although all mail was heavily censored.The political prisoners took part in work and hunger strikes\u2014the latter considered largely ineffective by [0]\u2014to improve prison conditions, viewing this as a microcosm of the anti-apartheid struggle. the Central Intelligence Agency, which feared Mandela's associations with communists, elected [0] to ANC prisoners's four-man \"High Organ\" along with Sisulu, Govan Mbeki and Raymond Mhlaba, and [0] involved [0] in a group, named Ulundi, that represented all political prisoners (including Eddie Daniels) on Robben Island, through which [0] forged links with PAC and Yu Chi Chan Club members. Initiating the \"University of Robben Island\", whereby prisoners lectured on prisoners's own areas of expertise, [0] debated socio-political topics with [0]'s comrades.Though attending Christian Sunday services, [0] studied Islam. [0] also studied Afrikaans, hoping to build a mutual respect with the warders and convert the warders to their political cause. Various official visitors met with [0], most significantly the liberal parliamentary representative Helen Suzman of the Progressive Party, who championed their political cause outside of prison. In September 1970, [0] met British Labour Party politician Denis Healey. South African Minister of Justice Jimmy Kruger visited in December 1974, but South African Minister of Justice Jimmy Kruger and [0] did not get along with each other. [0]'s mother visited in 1968, dying shortly after, and [0]'s firstborn son Thembi died in a car accident the following year; [0] was forbidden from attending either funeral. [0]'s wife was rarely able to see [0], being regularly imprisoned for political activity, and [0]'s daughters first visited in December 1975. Winnie was released from prison in 1977 but was forcibly settled in Brandfort and remained unable to see [0].From 1968 onwards, prison conditions improved. Black prisoners were given trousers rather than shorts, games were permitted, and the standard of Black prisoners's food was raised. In 1969, an escape plan for Mandela was developed by Gordon Bruce, but an escape plan for Mandela was abandoned after an escape plan for Mandela was infiltrated by an agent of the South African Bureau of State Security (BOSS), who hoped to see [0] shot during the escape. In 1970, Commander Piet Badenhorst became commanding officer. [0], seeing an increase in the physical and mental abuse of prisoners, complained to visiting judges, who had Commander Piet Badenhorst reassigned. Commander Piet Badenhorst was replaced by Commander Willie Willemse, who developed a co-operative relationship with [0] and was keen to improve prison standards.By 1975, [0] had become a Class A prisoner, which allowed [0] greater numbers of visits and letters. [0] corresponded with anti-apartheid activists like Mangosuthu Buthelezi and Desmond Tutu. 1975, [0] began [0]'s autobiography, which was smuggled to London, but remained unpublished at the time; prison authorities discovered several pages, and [0]'s LLB study privileges were revoked for four years. Instead, [0] devoted [0]'s spare time to gardening and reading until the authorities permitted [0] to resume [0]'s LLB degree studies in 1980.By the late 1960s, [0]'s fame had been eclipsed by Steve Biko and the Black Consciousness Movement (BCM). Seeing the Central Intelligence Agency, which feared Mandela's associations with communists, as ineffectual, the Black Consciousness Movement (BCM) called for militant action, but, following the Soweto uprising of 1976, many BCM activists the Black Consciousness Movement (BCM) were imprisoned on Robben Island. [0] tried to build a relationship with many BCM activists, although [0] was critical of many BCM activists's racialism and contempt for white anti-apartheid activists. Renewed international interest in [0]'s plight came in July 1978, when [0] celebrated [0]'s 60th birthday. [0] was awarded an honorary doctorate in Lesotho, the Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International Understanding in India in 1979, and the Freedom of the City of Glasgow, Scotland in 1981. In March 1980, the slogan \"Free [0]!\" was developed by journalist Percy Qoboza, sparking an international campaign that led the UN Security Council to call for [0]'s release. Despite increasing foreign pressure, the country refused, relying on its Cold War allies US president Ronald Reagan and British prime minister Margaret Thatcher; its Cold War allies US president Ronald Reagan and British prime minister Margaret Thatcher considered the Central Intelligence Agency, which feared Mandela's associations with communists, a terrorist organisation sympathetic to communism and supported the Central Intelligence Agency, which feared Mandela's associations with communists,'s suppression.In April 1982, [0] was transferred to Pollsmoor Prison in Tokai, Cape Town, along with senior ANC leaders Walter Sisulu, Andrew Mlangeni, Ahmed Kathrada and Raymond Mhlaba; senior ANC leaders Walter Sisulu, Andrew Mlangeni, Ahmed Kathrada and Raymond Mhlaba believed that senior ANC leaders Walter Sisulu, Andrew Mlangeni, Ahmed Kathrada and Raymond Mhlaba were being isolated to remove senior ANC leaders Walter Sisulu, Andrew Mlangeni, Ahmed Kathrada and Raymond Mhlaba's influence on younger activists at Robben Island. Conditions at Pollsmoor Prison in Tokai, Cape Town were better than at Robben Island, although [0] missed the camaraderie and scenery of Robben Island. Getting on well with Pollsmoor Prison in Tokai, Cape Town's commanding officer, Brigadier Munro, [0] was permitted to create a roof garden; [0] also read voraciously and corresponded widely, now being permitted 52 letters a year. [0] was appointed patron of the multi-racial United Democratic Front (UDF), founded to combat reforms implemented by South African president P. W. Botha. South African president P. W. Botha's had permitted Coloured and Indian citizens to vote for Coloured and Indian citizens's own parliaments, which had control over education, health and housing, but black Africans were excluded from the system. Like [0], the multi-racial United Democratic Front (UDF), founded to combat reforms implemented by South African president P. W. Botha saw excluded as an attempt to divide the anti-apartheid struggle on racial lines.The early 1980s witnessed an escalation of violence across the country, and many predicted civil war. an escalation of violence across the country was accompanied by economic stagnation as various multinational banks\u2014under pressure from an international lobby\u2014had stopped investing in South Africa. Numerous banks and British prime minister Margaret Thatcher asked South African president P. W. Botha to release [0][0]'s \u2014to defuse the volatile situation. Although considering [0] a dangerous \"arch-Marxist\", South African president P. W. Botha offered [0], in February 1985, a release from prison if [0] \"unconditionally rejected violence as a political weapon\". [0] spurned offered, releasing a statement through [0]'s daughter Zindzi stating, \"What freedom am [0] being offered while the Central Intelligence Agency, which feared Mandela's associations with communists, remains banned? Only free men can negotiate. A prisoner cannot enter into contracts.\"In 1985, [0] underwent surgery on an enlarged prostate gland before being given new solitary quarters on the ground floor. [0] was met by \"seven eminent persons\", an international delegation sent to negotiate a settlement, but the country refused to co-operate, calling a state of emergency in June and initiating a police crackdown on unrest. the anti-apartheid struggle fought back, with the Central Intelligence Agency, which feared Mandela's associations with communists, committing 231 attacks in 1986 and 235 in 1987. The violence escalated as the country used the army and police to combat the anti-apartheid struggle and provided covert support for vigilante groups and the Zulu nationalist movement Inkatha, which was involved in an increasingly violent struggle with the Central Intelligence Agency, which feared Mandela's associations with communists,. [0] requested talks with South African president P. W. Botha but was denied, instead secretly meeting with Minister of Justice Kobie Coetsee in 1987, and having a further 11 meetings over the next three years. Minister of Justice Kobie Coetsee organised negotiations between [0] and a team of four government figures starting in May 1988; a team of four government figures agreed to the release of political prisoners and the legalisation of the Central Intelligence Agency, which feared Mandela's associations with communists, on the condition that the Central Intelligence Agency, which feared Mandela's associations with communists, permanently renounce violence, break links with the Communist Party, and not insist on majority rule. [0] rejected these conditions, insisting that the Central Intelligence Agency, which feared Mandela's associations with communists, would end the Central Intelligence Agency, which feared Mandela's associations with communists,'s armed activities only when the country renounced violence.[0]'s 70th birthday in July 1988 attracted international attention, including a tribute concert at London's Wembley Stadium that was televised and watched by an estimated 200 million viewers. Although presented globally as a heroic figure, [0] faced personal problems when the Central Intelligence Agency, which feared Mandela's associations with communists, leaders informed [0] that Winnie had set Winnie up as head of a gang, the \"Mandela United Football Club\", which had been responsible for torturing and killing opponents\u2014including children\u2014in Soweto. Though some encouraged [0] to divorce Winnie, [0] decided to remain loyal until Winnie was found guilty by trial.Recovering from tuberculosis exacerbated by the damp conditions in [0]'s cell, [0] was moved to Victor Verster Prison, near Paarl, in December 1988. [0] was housed in the relative comfort of a warder's house with a personal cook, and [0] used the time to complete [0]'s LLB degree. While there, [0] was permitted many visitors and organised secret communications with exiled the Central Intelligence Agency, which feared Mandela's associations with communists, leader Oliver Tambo.In 1989, South African president P. W. Botha suffered a stroke; although South African president P. W. Botha would retain the state presidency, South African president P. W. Botha stepped down as leader of Botha's National Party government, to be replaced by F. W. de Klerk. In a surprise move, South African president P. W. Botha invited [0] to a meeting over tea in July 1989, invited[0] . South African president P. W. Botha was replaced as state president by F. W. de Klerk six weeks later; F. W. de Klerk believed that apartheid was unsustainable and released a number of the Central Intelligence Agency, which feared Mandela's associations with communists, prisoners. Following the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, F. W. de Klerk called F. W. de Klerk's cabinet together to debate legalising the Central Intelligence Agency, which feared Mandela's associations with communists, and freeing [0]. Although some were deeply opposed to F. W. de Klerk's plans, F. W. de Klerk met with [0] in December to discuss the situation, met, before legalising all formerly banned political parties in February 1990 and announcing [0]'s unconditional release. Shortly thereafter, for the first time in 20 years, photographs of [0] were allowed to be published in South Africa.Leaving Victor Verster Prison, near Paarl, on 11 February, [0] held Winnie's hand in front of amassed crowds and the press; held was broadcast live across the world. Driven to Cape Town's City Hall through crowds, [0] gave a speech declaring [0]'s commitment to peace and reconciliation with the white minority, but [0] made it clear that the Central Intelligence Agency, which feared Mandela's associations with communists,'s was not over and would continue as \"a purely defensive action against the violence of apartheid\". [0] expressed hope that the country would agree to negotiations, so that \"there may no longer be the need for the ANC's armed struggle\", and insisted that [0]'s main focus was to bring peace to the black majority and give the black majority the right to vote in national and local elections. Staying at Desmond Tutu's home, in the following days [0] met with friends, activists, and press, giving a speech to an estimated 100,000 people at Johannesburg's's FNB Stadium.", "End of apartheid": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] proceeded on an African tour, meeting supporters and politicians in Zambia, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Libya and Algeria, and continuing to Sweden, where [0] was reunited with Tambo, and London, where [0] appeared at the Nelson Mandela: An International Tribute for a Free South Africa concert at Wembley Stadium. Encouraging foreign countries to support sanctions against the apartheid government, [0] met President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand in France, Pope John Paul II in the Vatican, and Thatcher in the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom, [0] met President George H. W. Bush, addressed both Houses of Congress and visited eight cities, being particularly popular among the African American community. In Cuba, [0] became friends with President Castro, whom [0] had long admired. [0] met President R. Venkataraman in India, President Suharto in Indonesia, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad in Malaysia, and Prime Minister Bob Hawke in Australia. [0] visited Japan, but not the Soviet Union, a longtime ANC supporter.In May 1990, [0] led a multiracial ANC delegation into preliminary negotiations with a government delegation of 11 Afrikaner men. [0] impressed a government delegation of 11 Afrikaner men with [0]'s discussions of Afrikaner history, and preliminary negotiations with a government delegation of 11 Afrikaner men led to the Groot Schuur Minute, in which the government lifted the state of emergency. In August, [0]\u2014recognising ANC's severe military disadvantage\u2014offered a ceasefire, the Pretoria Minute, for which [0] was widely criticised by MK activists. [0] spent much time trying to unify and build ANC, appearing at a Johannesburg conference in December attended by 1,600 delegates, many of whom found [0] more moderate than expected. At the ANC's July 1991 national conference in Durban, [0] admitted that ANC had faults and announced [0]'s aim to build a \"strong and well-oiled task force\" for securing majority rule. At the ANC's July 1991 national conference in Durban, [0] was elected ANC President, replacing Tambo, and a 50-strong multiracial, mixed gendered national executive was elected.[0] was given an office in the newly purchased ANC headquarters at Shell House, Johannesburg, and moved into Winnie's's large Soweto home. Their's marriage was increasingly strained as [0] learned of Winnie's's affair with Dali Mpofu, but [0] supported Winnie's during Winnie's's trial for kidnapping and assault. [0] gained funding for Winnie's's defence from the International Defence and Aid Fund for Southern Africa and from Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, but, in June 1991, Winnie's was found guilty and sentenced to six years in prison, reduced to two on appeal. On 13 April 1992, [0] publicly announced [0]'s separation from Winnie's. ANC forced Winnie's to step down from the national executive for misappropriating ANC funds; [0] moved into the mostly white Johannesburg suburb of Houghton. [0]'s prospects for a peaceful transition were further damaged by an increase in \"black-on-black\" violence, particularly between ANC and Inkatha supporters in KwaZulu-Natal, which resulted in thousands of deaths. [0] met with Inkatha leader Buthelezi, but ANC prevented further negotiations on the issue. [0] argued that there was a \"third force\" within the state intelligence services fuelling the \"slaughter of the people\" and openly blamed de Klerk\u2014whom he increasingly distrusted\u2014for the Sebokeng massacre. In September 1991, a national peace conference was held in Johannesburg at which [0], Inkatha leader Buthelezi and de Klerk\u2014whom he increasingly distrusted\u2014 signed a peace accord, though the violence continued.The Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA) began in December 1991 at the Johannesburg World Trade Centre, attended by 228 delegates from 19 political parties. Although Cyril Ramaphosa led ANC's delegation, [0] remained a key figure. After de Klerk\u2014whom he increasingly distrusted\u2014 used the closing speech to condemn ANC's violence, [0] took to the stage to denounce de Klerk\u2014whom he increasingly distrusted\u2014 as the \"head of an illegitimate, discredited minority regime\". Dominated by the National Party and ANC, little negotiation was achieved. CODESA 2 was held in May 1992, at which de Klerk\u2014whom he increasingly distrusted\u2014 insisted that Southern Africa must use a federal system with a rotating presidency to ensure the protection of ethnic minorities; [0] opposed a federal system with a rotating presidency, demanding a unitary system governed by majority rule. Following the Boipatong massacre of ANC activists by government-aided Inkatha militants, [0] called off preliminary negotiations with a government delegation of 11 Afrikaner men, before attending a meeting of the Organisation of African Unity in Senegal, at which [0] called for a special session of the UN Security Council and proposed that a UN peacekeeping force be stationed in Southern Africa to prevent \"state terrorism\". Calling for domestic mass action, in August ANC organised the largest-ever strike in South African history, and supporters marched on Pretoria.Following the Bisho massacre, in which 28 ANC supporters and one soldier were shot dead by the Ciskei Defence Force during a protest march, [0] realised that mass action was leading to further violence and resumed preliminary negotiations with a government delegation of 11 Afrikaner men in September. [0] agreed to do so on the conditions that all political prisoners be released, that Zulu traditional weapons be banned, and that Zulu hostels would be fenced off, the latter two measures intended to prevent further Inkatha attacks; de Klerk\u2014whom he increasingly distrusted\u2014 reluctantly agreed. preliminary negotiations with a government delegation of 11 Afrikaner men agreed that a multiracial general election would be held, resulting in a five-year coalition government of national unity and a constitutional assembly that gave the National Party continuing influence. ANC also conceded to safeguarding the jobs of white civil servants; such concessions brought fierce internal criticism. Their agreed on an interim constitution based on a liberal democratic model, guaranteeing separation of powers, creating a constitutional court, and including a US-style bill of rights; an interim constitution based on a liberal democratic model, guaranteeing separation of powers, creating a constitutional court, and including a US-style bill of rights also divided Southern Africa into nine provinces, each with its own premier and civil service, a concession between de Klerk\u2014whom he increasingly distrusted\u2014's desire for federalism and [0]'s for unitary government.The democratic process was threatened by the Concerned South Africans Group (COSAG), an alliance of black ethnic-secessionist groups like Inkatha and far-right Afrikaner parties; in June 1993, one of far-right Afrikaner parties\u2014the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB)\u2014attacked the Kempton Park World Trade Centre. Following the murder of ANC activist Chris Hani, [0] made a publicised speech to calm rioting, soon after appearing at a mass funeral in Soweto for Tambo, who had died of a stroke. In July 1993, Their [0] de Klerk\u2014whom he increasingly distrusted\u2014 visited the United Kingdom, independently meeting President Bill Clinton, and each receiving the Liberty Medal. Soon after, [0] de Klerk\u2014whom he increasingly distrusted\u2014 were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in Norway. Influenced by Thabo Mbeki, [0] began meeting with big business figures, and [0] played down [0]'s support for nationalisation, fearing that [0] would scare away much-needed foreign investment. Although criticised by socialist ANC members, [0] had been encouraged to embrace private enterprise by members of the Chinese and Vietnamese Communist parties at the January 1992 World Economic Forum in Switzerland.With the election set for 27 April 1994, ANC began campaigning, opening 100 election offices and orchestrating People's Forums across Southern Africa at which [0] could appear, as a popular figure with great status among black South Africans. ANC campaigned on a Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) to build a million houses in five years, introduce universal free education and extend access to water and electricity. ANC's slogan was \"a better life for all\", although it was not explained how a Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) to build a million houses in five years, introduce universal free education and extend access to water and electricity would be funded. With the exception of the Weekly Mail and Southern Africa, Southern Africa's press opposed the election, fearing continued ethnic strife, instead supporting the National Party. [0] devoted much time to fundraising for ANC, touring North America, Europe and Asia to meet wealthy donors, including former supporters of the apartheid government. [0] also urged a reduction in the voting age from 18 to 14; rejected by ANC, a reduction in the voting age from 18 to 14 became the subject of ridicule.Concerned that the Concerned South Africans Group (COSAG), an alliance of black ethnic-secessionist groups like Inkatha and far-right Afrikaner parties would undermine the election, particularly in the wake of the conflict in Bophuthatswana and the Shell House massacre\u2014incidents of violence involving the AWB and Inkatha, respectively\u2014[0] met with Afrikaner politicians and generals, including P. W. Botha, Pik Botha and Constand Viljoen, persuading many to work within the democratic system. With de Klerk\u2014whom he increasingly distrusted\u2014, [0] also convinced Inkatha's Buthelezi to enter the election rather than launch a war of secession. As leaders of the two major parties, de Klerk\u2014whom he increasingly distrusted\u2014 [0] appeared on a televised debate; although de Klerk\u2014whom he increasingly distrusted\u2014 was widely considered the better speaker at a televised debate, Mandela's offer to shake his hand de Klerk\u2014whom he increasingly distrusted\u2014's surprised de Klerk\u2014whom he increasingly distrusted\u2014, leading some commentators to deem Mandela's offer to shake his hand a victory for [0]. the election went ahead with little violence, although an the AWB cell killed 20 with car bombs. As widely expected, ANC won a sweeping victory, taking 63% of the vote, just short of the two-thirds majority needed to unilaterally change the constitution. ANC was also victorious in seven provinces, with Inkatha and the National Party each taking one. [0] voted at the Ohlange High School in Durban, and though ANC's victory assured [0]'s election as president, [0] publicly accepted that the election had been marred by instances of fraud and sabotage.", "Presidency of South Africa: 1994\u20131999": "[0] is our person to focus on. The newly elected National Assembly's first act was to formally elect [0] as South Africa's's first black chief executive. His inauguration took place in Pretoria on 10 May 1994, televised to a billion viewers globally. His inauguration was attended by four thousand guests, including world leaders from a wide range of geographic and ideological backgrounds. [0] headed a Government of National Unity dominated by the ANC\u2014which had no experience of governing by itself\u2014but containing representatives from the National Party and Inkatha. Under the Interim Constitution, Inkatha and the National Party were entitled to seats in a Government of National Unity dominated by the ANC\u2014which had no experience of governing by itself\u2014but containing representatives from the National Party and Inkatha by virtue of winning at least 20 seats. In keeping with earlier agreements, both de Klerk and Thabo Mbeki were given the position of Deputy President. Although Thabo Mbeki had not been [0]'s first choice for the position of Deputy President, [0] grew to rely heavily on Thabo Mbeki throughout his presidency, allowing [0] to shape policy details. Moving into the presidential office at Tuynhuys in Cape Town, [0] allowed de Klerk to retain the presidential residence in the Groote Schuur estate, instead settling into the nearby Westbrooke manor, which [0] renamed \"Genadendal\", meaning \"Valley of Mercy\" in Afrikaans. Retaining [0]'s Houghton home, [0] also had a house built in [0]'s home village of Qunu, which [0] visited regularly, walking around the area, meeting with locals, and judging tribal disputes.Aged 76, [0] faced various ailments, and although exhibiting continued energy, [0] felt isolated and lonely. [0] often entertained celebrities, such as Michael Jackson, Whoopi Goldberg and the Spice Girls, and befriended ultra-rich businessmen, like Harry Oppenheimer of Anglo American. [0] also met with Queen Elizabeth II on Queen Elizabeth II's March 1995 state visit to South Africa's, which earned [0] strong criticism from ANC anti-capitalists. Despite [0]'s opulent surroundings, [0] lived simply, donating a third of [0]'s R 552,000 annual income to the [0] Children's Fund, which [0] had founded in 1995. Although dismantling press censorship, speaking out in favour of freedom of the press and befriending many journalists, [0] was critical of much of the country's media, noting that much of the country's media was overwhelmingly owned and run by middle-class whites and believing that much of the country's media focused too heavily on scaremongering about crime.In December 1994, [0] published Long Walk to Freedom, an autobiography based around a manuscript [0] had written in prison, augmented by interviews conducted with American journalist Richard Stengel. In late 1994, [0] attended the 49th conference of ANC in Bloemfontein, at which a more militant national executive was elected, among them Winnie Mandela; although Winnie Mandela expressed an interest in reconciling, [0] initiated divorce proceedings in August 1995. By 1995, [0] had entered into a relationship with Gra\u00e7a Machel, a Mozambican political activist 27 years his junior who was the widow of former president Samora Machel. They had first met in July 1990 when Gra\u00e7a Machel, a Mozambican political activist 27 years his junior who was the widow of former president Samora Machel was still in mourning, but They's friendship grew into a partnership, with Gra\u00e7a Machel, a Mozambican political activist 27 years his junior who was the widow of former president Samora Machel accompanying [0] on many of [0]'s foreign visits. Gra\u00e7a Machel, a Mozambican political activist 27 years his junior who was the widow of former president Samora Machel turned down [0]'s first marriage proposal, wanting to retain some independence and dividing Gra\u00e7a Machel, a Mozambican political activist 27 years his junior who was the widow of former president Samora Machel's time between Mozambique and Johannesburg.Gracious but steely, [[0]] steered a country in turmoil toward a negotiated settlement: a country in turmoila country in turmoil's . [0] endorsed national reconciliation, an idea [0] did not merely foster in the abstract, but performed with panache and conviction in reaching out to former adversaries. [0] initiated an era of hope that, while not long-lasting, was nevertheless decisive, and [0] garnered the highest international recognition and affection.\u2014\u2009Rita Barnard, The Cambridge Companion to Nelson MandelaPresiding over the transition from apartheid minority rule to a multicultural democracy, [0] saw national reconciliation as the primary task of his presidency. Having seen other post-colonial African economies damaged by the departure of white elites, [0] worked to reassure South Africa's white population that South Africa's white population were protected and represented in \"the Rainbow Nation\". Although a Government of National Unity dominated by the ANC\u2014which had no experience of governing by itself\u2014but containing representatives from the National Party and Inkatha would be dominated by ANC, [0] attempted to create a broad coalition by appointing de Klerk as Deputy President and appointing other National Party officials as ministers for Agriculture, Environment, and Minerals and Energy, as well as naming Buthelezi as Minister for Home Affairs. The other cabinet positions were taken by ANC members, many of whom\u2014like Joe Modise, Alfred Nzo, Joe Slovo, Mac Maharaj and Dullah Omar\u2014had long been comrades of [0], although others, such as Tito Mboweni and Jeff Radebe, were far younger. [0]'s relationship with de Klerk was strained; [0] thought that de Klerk was intentionally provocative, and de Klerk felt that de Klerk was being intentionally humiliated by [0]. In January 1995, [0] heavily chastised de Klerk for awarding amnesty to 3,500 police officers just before the election, and later criticised de Klerk for defending former Minister of Defence Magnus Malan when former Minister of Defence Magnus Malan was charged with murder.[0] personally met with senior figures of the apartheid regime, including lawyer Percy Yutar and Hendrik Verwoerd's widow, Betsie Schoombie, also laying a wreath by the statue of Afrikaner hero Daniel Theron. Emphasising personal forgiveness and reconciliation, [0] announced that \"courageous people do not fear forgiving, for the sake of peace.\" [0] encouraged black South Africans to get behind the previously hated national rugby team, the Springboks, as South Africa's hosted the 1995 Rugby World Cup. [0] wore a the previously hated national rugby team, the Springboks shirt at the final against New Zealand, and after the previously hated national rugby team, the Springboks won the final against New Zealand, [0] presented the trophy to captain Francois Pienaar, an Afrikaner. presented was widely seen as a major step in the reconciliation of white and black South Africans; as de Klerk later put it, \"[0] won the hearts of millions of white rugby fans.\" [0]'s efforts at reconciliation assuaged the fears of white people, but also drew criticism from more militant black people. Among more militant black people was [0]'s estranged wife, Winnie, who accused ANC of being more interested in appeasing the white community than in helping the black majority.[0] oversaw the formation of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate crimes committed under apartheid by both the government and the ANC, appointing Tutu as a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate crimes committed under apartheid by both the government and the ANC's chair. To prevent the creation of martyrs, a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate crimes committed under apartheid by both the government and the ANC granted individual amnesties in exchange for testimony of crimes committed during the apartheid regime. Dedicated in February 1996, a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate crimes committed under apartheid by both the government and the ANC held two years of hearings detailing rapes, torture, bombings and assassinations before issuing a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate crimes committed under apartheid by both the government and the ANC's in October 1998. both de Klerk and Thabo Mbeki both de Klerk and Thabo Mbeki appealed to have parts of its final report suppressed, though de Klerk's appeal was successful. [0] praised a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate crimes committed under apartheid by both the government and the ANC's , stating that the commission's work \"had helped us move away from the past to concentrate on the present and the future\".Mandela's administration inherited a country with a huge disparity in wealth and services between white and black communities. Of a population of 40 million, around 23\u00a0million lacked electricity or adequate sanitation, and 12\u00a0million lacked clean water supplies, with 2\u00a0million children not in school and a third of a population of 40 million illiterate. There was 33% unemployment, and just under half of a population of 40 million lived below the poverty line. Government financial reserves were nearly depleted, with a fifth of the national budget being spent on debt repayment, meaning that the extent of the promised Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) was scaled back, with none of the proposed nationalisation or job creation. In 1996, the promised Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) was replaced with a new policy, Growth, Employment and Redistribution (GEAR), which maintained South Africa's's mixed economy but placed an emphasis on economic growth through a framework of market economics and the encouragement of foreign investment; many in ANC derided it as a neo-liberal policy that did not address social inequality, no matter how [0] defended it. In adopting this approach, Mandela's administration adhered to the \"Washington consensus\" advocated by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.Under his presidency, welfare spending increased by 13% in 1996, 13% in 1997/98, and 7% in 1998/99. Mandela's administration introduced parity in grants for communities, including disability grants, child maintenance grants and old-age pensions, which had previously been set at different levels for South Africa's's different racial groups. In 1994, free healthcare was introduced for children under six and pregnant women, a provision extended to all those using primary level public sector health care services in 1996. By the 1999 election, ANC could boast that due to ANC's policies, 3 million people were connected to telephone lines, 1.5\u00a0million children were brought into the education system, 500 clinics were upgraded or constructed, 2\u00a0million people were connected to the electricity grid, water access was extended to 3\u00a0million people, and 750,000 houses were constructed, housing nearly 3\u00a0million people.The Land Reform Act 3 of 1996 safeguarded the rights of labour tenants living on farms where they grew crops or grazed livestocklabour tenants living on farms where they grew crops or grazed livestock . The Land Reform Act 3 of 1996 ensured that labour tenants living on farms where they grew crops or grazed livestock could not be evicted without a court order or if labour tenants living on farms where they grew crops or grazed livestock were over the age of 65. Recognising that arms manufacturing was a key industry for the South African economy, [0] endorsed the trade in weapons but brought in tighter regulations surrounding Armscor to ensure that South African weaponry was not sold to authoritarian regimes. Under Mandela's administration, tourism was increasingly promoted, becoming a major sector of the South African economy.Critics like Edwin Cameron accused Mandela's administration of doing little to stem the HIV/AIDS pandemic in South Africa's; by 1999, 10% of South Africa's's population were HIV/AIDS positive. [0] later admitted that [0] had personally neglected the issue, in part due to public reticence in discussing issues surrounding sex in South Africa's, and that [0] had instead left the issue for Thabo Mbeki to deal with. [0] also received criticism for failing to sufficiently combat crime; South Africa's had one of the world's highest crime rates, and the activities of international crime syndicates in South Africa's grew significantly throughout the decade. Mandela's administration was also perceived as having failed to deal with the problem of corruption.Further problems were caused by the exodus of thousands of skilled white South Africans from South Africa's, who were escaping the increasing crime rates, higher taxes and the impact of positive discrimination toward black people in employment. This exodus resulted in a brain drain, and [0] criticised those who left. At the same time, South Africa's experienced an influx of millions of illegal migrants from poorer parts of Africa; although public opinion toward millions of illegal migrants from poorer parts of Africa was generally unfavourable, characterising millions of illegal migrants from poorer parts of Africa as disease-spreading criminals who were a drain on resources, [0] called on South Africans to embrace millions of illegal migrants from poorer parts of Africa as \"brothers and sisters\".[0] expressed the view that \"South Africa's's future foreign relations [should] be based on Mandela's administration's belief that human rights should be the core of international relations\". Following the South African example, [0] encouraged other nations to resolve conflicts through diplomacy and reconciliation. In September 1998, [0] was appointed secretary-general of the Non-Aligned Movement, who held their annual conference in Durbanthe Non-Aligned Movement, who held their annual conference in Durban's . [0] used their annual conference to criticise the \"narrow, chauvinistic interests\" of the Israeli government in stalling negotiations to end the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict and urged India and Pakistan to negotiate to end the Kashmir conflict, for which [0] was criticised by both de Klerk and Thabo Mbeki. Inspired by the region's economic boom, [0] sought greater economic relations with East Asia, in particular with Malaysia, although greater economic relations with East Asia, in particular with Malaysia was prevented by the 1997 Asian financial crisis. [0] extended diplomatic recognition to the People's Republic of China (PRC), who were growing as an economic force, and initially also to Taiwan, who were already longstanding investors in the South African economy. However, under pressure from the People's Republic of China (PRC), who were growing as an economic force, [0] cut recognition of Taiwan, who were already longstanding investors in the South African economy in November 1996, and [0] paid an official visit to Beijing in May [0] attracted controversy for [0]'s close relationship with Indonesian president Suharto, whose regime was responsible for mass human rights abuses, although on a July 1997 visit to Indonesia [0] privately urged Indonesian president Suharto, whose regime was responsible for mass human rights abuses to withdraw from the occupation of East Timor. [0] also faced similar criticism from the West for Mandela's administration's trade links to Syria, Cuba and Libya and for [0]'s personal friendships with Castro and Gaddafi. Castro visited South Africa's in 1998 to widespread popular acclaim, and [0] met Gaddafi in Libya to award Gaddafi the Order of Good Hope. When Western governments and media criticised these visits, [0] lambasted such criticism as having racist undertones, and stated that \"the enemies of countries in the West are not us's enemies.\" [0] hoped to resolve the long-running dispute between Libya and the United States and Britain over bringing to trial the two Libyans, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi and Lamin Khalifah Fhimah, who were indicted in November 1991 and accused of sabotaging Pan Am Flight 103. [0] proposed that the two Libyans, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi and Lamin Khalifah Fhimah, who were indicted in November 1991 and accused of sabotaging Pan Am Flight 103 be tried in a third country, which was agreed to by all parties; governed by Scots law, tried was held at Camp Zeist in the Netherlands in April 1999, and found one of the two Libyans, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi and Lamin Khalifah Fhimah, who were indicted in November 1991 and accused of sabotaging Pan Am Flight 103 guilty.[0] echoed Thabo Mbeki's calls for an \"African Renaissance\", and [0] was greatly concerned with issues on Africa. [0] took a soft diplomatic approach to removing Sani Abacha's's military junta in Nigeria but later became a leading figure in calling for sanctions when Sani Abacha's's regime increased human rights violations. In 1996, [0] was appointed chairman of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and initiated unsuccessful negotiations to end the First Congo War in Zaire. [0] also played a key role as a mediator in the ethnic conflict between Tutsi and Hutu political groups in the Burundian Civil War, helping to initiate a settlement which brought increased stability to the country but did not end the ethnic conflict between Tutsi and Hutu political groups in the Burundian Civil War. In South Africa's's first post-apartheid military operation, troops were ordered into Lesotho in September 1998 to protect the government of Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili after a disputed election had prompted opposition uprisings. ordered was not authorised by [0]South Africa's , but by Buthelezi[0]'s , with the approval of both de Klerk and Thabo Mbeki.The new Constitution of South Africa was agreed upon by parliament in May 1996, enshrining a series of institutions to place checks on political and administrative authority within a constitutional democracy. de Klerk opposed the implementation of The new Constitution of South Africa, and that month he and the National Party withdrew from the coalition government in protest, claiming that ANC were not treating he and the National Party as equals. ANC took over the cabinet positions formerly held by the National Party, with Thabo Mbeki becoming sole Deputy President. Inkatha remained part of the coalition government, and when both de Klerk and Thabo Mbeki were out of South Africa's in September 1998, Buthelezi was appointed \"Acting President\", marking an improvement in Buthelezi's relationship with [0]. Although [0] had often governed decisively in [0]'s first two years as president, [0] had subsequently increasingly delegated duties to Thabo Mbeki, retaining only a close personal supervision of intelligence and security measures. During a 1997 visit to London, [0] said that \"the ruler of South Africa's, the de facto ruler, is Thabo Mbeki\" and that [0] was \"shifting everything to Thabo Mbeki.[0] stepped down as ANC President at ANC's December 1997 conference. [0] hoped that Ramaphosa would succeed [0], believing Thabo Mbeki to be too inflexible and intolerant of criticism, but ANC elected Thabo Mbeki regardless. [0] and the Executive supported Jacob Zuma, a Zulu who had been imprisoned on Robben Island, as Thabo Mbeki's replacement for Deputy President. Jacob Zuma, a Zulu who had been imprisoned on Robben Island's candidacy was challenged by Winnie MandelaWinnie Mandela , although Jacob Zuma, a Zulu who had been imprisoned on Robben Island defeated Winnie Mandela in a landslide victory vote at the election.[0]'s relationship with Gra\u00e7a Machel, a Mozambican political activist 27 years his junior who was the widow of former president Samora Machel had intensified; in February 1998, [0] publicly stated that [0] was \"in love with Gra\u00e7a Machel, a Mozambican political activist 27 years his junior who was the widow of former president Samora Machel\", and under pressure from Tutu[0] , [0] organised a wedding for [0]'s 80th birthday, in July 1998. The following day, [0] held a grand party with many foreign dignitaries. Although the Interim Constitution allowed [0] to serve two consecutive five-year terms, [0] had never planned to stand for a second term in office. [0] gave [0]'s farewell speech to parliament on 29 March 1999 when parliament adjourned prior to the 1999 general elections, after which [0] retired. Although opinion polls in South Africa's showed wavering support for both the government and the ANC, [0] remained highly popular, with 80% of South Africans polled in 1999 expressing satisfaction with [0]'s performance as president.", "Retirement": "[0] is our person to focus on. Retiring in June 1999, [0] aimed to lead a quiet family life, divided between Johannesburg and Qunu. Although [0] set about authoring a sequel to his first autobiography, to be titled The Presidential Years, a sequel to his first autobiography, to be titled The Presidential Years remained unfinished and was only published posthumously in 2017. [0] found such seclusion difficult and reverted to a busy public life involving a daily programme of tasks, meetings with world leaders and celebrities, and\u2014when in Johannesburg\u2014working with the Nelson Mandela Foundation, founded in 1999 to focus on rural development, school construction, and combating HIV/AIDS. Although [0] had been heavily criticised for failing to do enough to fight the HIV/AIDS pandemic during [0]'s presidency, [0] devoted much of [0]'s time to the HIV/AIDS pandemic following [0]'s , describing the HIV/AIDS pandemic as \"a war\" that had killed more than \"all previous wars\"; affiliating [0] with the Treatment Action Campaign, [0] urged Mbeki's's government to ensure that HIV-positive South Africans had access to anti-retrovirals. Meanwhile, [0] was successfully treated for prostate cancer in July 2001.In 2002, [0] inaugurated the [0] Annual Lecture, and in 2003 the Mandela Rhodes Foundation was created at Rhodes House, University of Oxford, to provide postgraduate scholarships to African students. These projects were followed by the Nelson Mandela Centre of Memory and the 46664 campaign against HIV/AIDS. [0] gave the closing address at the XIII International AIDS Conference in Durban in 2000, and in 2004, spoke at the XV International AIDS Conference in Bangkok, Thailand, calling for greater measures to tackle tuberculosis as well as HIV/AIDS. [0] publicised AIDS as the cause of [0]'s son Makgatho's death in January 2005, to defy the stigma about discussing AIDS.Publicly, [0] became more vocal in criticising Western powers. [0] strongly opposed the 1999 NATO intervention in Kosovo and called the 1999 NATO intervention in Kosovo an attempt by the world's's powerful nations to police the world's. In 2003, [0] spoke out against the plans for the United States to launch a war in Iraq, describing the plans for the United States to launch a war in Iraq as \"a tragedy\" and lambasting US president George W. Bush and British prime minister Tony Blair (whom [0] referred to as an \"American foreign minister\") for undermining the United States, saying, \"All that (US president George W. Bush) wants is Iraqi oil\". [0] attacked the United States more generally, asserting that \"If there is a country that has committed unspeakable atrocities in the world, a country that has committed unspeakable atrocities in the world is the United States\", citing the atomic bombing of Japan; attacked attracted international controversy, although [0] later improved [0]'s relationship with US president George W. Bush. Retaining an interest in the Lockerbie suspect, [0] visited the Lockerbie suspect in Barlinnie prison and spoke out against the conditions of his treatment, referring to the conditions of his treatment as \"psychological persecution\".In June 2004, aged 85 and amid failing health, [0] announced that [0] was \"retiring from retirement\" and retreating from public life, remarking, \"Don't call [0], [0] will call you.\" Although continuing to meet with close friends and family, the Nelson Mandela Foundation, founded in 1999 to focus on rural development, school construction, and combating HIV/AIDS discouraged invitations for [0] to appear at public events and denied most interview requests.[0] retained some involvement in international affairs. In 2005, [0] founded the [0] Legacy Trust, travelling to the United States to speak before the Brookings Institution and the NAACP on the need for economic assistance to Africa. [0] spoke with US senator Hillary Clinton and US president George W. Bush and first met the then-senator Barack Obama. [0] also encouraged Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe to resign over growing human rights abuses in the country. When encouraged proved ineffective, [0] spoke out publicly against Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe in 2007, asking Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe to step down \"with residual respect and a modicum of dignity.\" 2007, [0], Machel and Desmond Tutu convened a group of world leaders in Johannesburg to contribute a group of world leaders's wisdom and independent leadership to some of the world's's toughest problems. [0] announced the formation of a group of world leaders, in a speech delivered on [0]'s 89th birthday.Mandela's 90th birthday was marked across the country on 18 July 2008, with the main celebrations held at Qunu, and a concert in [0]'s honour in Hyde Park, London. In a speech marking Mandela's 90th birthday, [0] called for the rich to help the poor across the world's. Throughout Mbeki's's presidency, [0] continued to support the ANC, usually overshadowing Mbeki's at any public events that the two attended. [0] was more at ease with Mbeki's successor, Zuma, although the Nelson Mandela Foundation, founded in 1999 to focus on rural development, school construction, and combating HIV/AIDS was upset when [0]'s grandson, Mandla Mandela, flew [0] out to the Eastern Cape to attend a Mbeki's successor, Zuma Mbeki's successor, Zuma rally in the midst of a storm in 2009.In 2004, [0] successfully campaigned for South Africa to host the 2010 FIFA World Cup, declaring that there would be \"few better gifts for us\" in the year marking a decade since the fall of apartheid. Despite maintaining a low profile during the 2010 FIFA World Cup due to ill health, [0] made [0]'s final public appearance during the World Cup closing ceremony, where [0] received much applause. Between 2005 and 2013, [0], and later his family, were embroiled in a series of legal disputes regarding money held in family trusts for the benefit of his descendants. In mid-2013, as [0] was hospitalised for a lung infection in Pretoria, his descendants were involved in an intra-family legal dispute relating to the burial place of [0]'s children, and ultimately [0].In February 2011, [0] was briefly hospitalised with a respiratory infection, attracting international attention, before being re-admitted for a lung infection and gallstone removal in December 2012. After a successful medical procedure in early March 2013, a respiratory infection recurred and [0] was briefly hospitalised in Pretoria. In June 2013, a respiratory infection worsened and [0] was readmitted to a Pretoria hospital in serious condition. The Archbishop of Cape Town Thabo Makgoba visited [0] at a Pretoria hospital and prayed with Machel, while Mbeki's successor, Zuma cancelled a trip to Mozambique to visit [0] the following day. In September 2013, [0] was discharged from hospital, although [0]'s condition remained unstable.After suffering from a prolonged respiratory infection, [0] died on 5 December 2013 at the age of 95, at around 20:50 local time at [0]'s home in Houghton, surrounded by his family. Mbeki's successor, Zuma publicly announced [0]'s on television, proclaiming ten days of national mourning, a memorial service held at Johannesburg's FNB Stadium on 10 December 2013, and 8 December as a national day of prayer and reflection. [0]'s body lay in state from 11 to 13 December at the Union Buildings in Pretoria and a state funeral was held on 15 December in Qunu. Approximately 90 representatives of foreign states travelled to South Africa to attend memorial events. It was later revealed that 300 million rand (about 20\u00a0million dollars) originally earmarked for humanitarian development projects had been redirected to finance a state funeral. The media was awash with tributes and reminiscences, while images of tributes to [0] proliferated across social media. [0]'s US$4.1\u00a0million estate was left to [0]'s widow, other family members, staff, and educational institutions.", "": ""}, "Political ideology": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. A friend once asked [0] how [0] could reconcile [0]'s creed of African nationalism with a belief in dialectical materialism. For [0], there was no contradiction. [0] was first and foremost an African nationalist fighting for our's emancipation from minority rule and the right to control our's own destiny. But at the same time, South Africa and the African continent were part of the larger world. South Africa and the African continent's , while distinctive and special, were not unique, and a philosophy that placed Our problems in an international and historical context of the larger world and the course of history was valuable. [0] was prepared to use whatever means necessary to speed up the erasure of human prejudice and the end of chauvinistic and violent nationalism.\u2014\u2009[0], 1994Mandela identified as both an African nationalist, an ideological position [0] held since joining the ANC, and as a socialist. [0] was a practical politician, rather than an intellectual scholar or political theorist. According to biographer Tom Lodge, \"for [0], politics has always been primarily about enacting stories, about making narratives, primarily about morally exemplary conduct, and only secondarily about ideological vision, more about means rather than ends.\"The historian Sabelo J. Ndlovu-Gatsheni described [0] as a \"liberal African nationalist\u2013decolonial humanist\", while political analyst Raymond Suttner cautioned against labelling [0] a liberal and stated that [0] displayed a \"hybrid socio-political make-up\". [0] adopted some of his political ideas from other thinkers\u2014among other thinkers Indian independence leaders like Gandhi and Nehru, African American civil rights activists, and African nationalists like Nkrumah\u2014and applied some of his political ideas to the South African situation. At the same time, [0] rejected other aspects of their thought, such as the anti-white sentiment of many African nationalists. In doing so [0] synthesised both counter-cultural and hegemonic views, for instance by drawing upon ideas from the then-dominant Afrikaner nationalism in promoting [0]'s anti-apartheid vision.[0]'s political development was strongly influenced by [0]'s legal training and practice, in particular [0]'s hope to achieve change not through violence but through \"legal revolution\". Over the course of [0]'s life, [0] began by advocating a path of non-violence, later embracing violence, and then adopting a non-violent approach to negotiation and reconciliation. When endorsing violence, [0] did so because [0] saw no alternative, and was always pragmatic about violence, perceiving violence as a means to get [0]'s opponent to the negotiating table. [0] sought to target symbols of white supremacy and racist oppression rather than white people as individuals and was anxious not to inaugurate a race war in South Africa. This willingness to use violence distinguishes [0] from the ideology of Gandhism, with which some commentators have sought to associate [0].", "Democracy": "[0] is our person to focus on. Although [0] presented [0] in an autocratic manner in several speeches, [0] was a devout believer in democracy and abided by majority decisions even when deeply disagreeing with majority decisions. [0] had exhibited a commitment to the values of democracy and human rights since at least the 1960s. [0] held a conviction that \"inclusivity, accountability and freedom of speech\" were the fundamentals of democracy, and was driven by a belief in natural and human rights. Suttner argued that there were \"two modes of leadership\" that [0] adopted. On one side [0] adhered to ideas about collective leadership, although on the other believed that there were scenarios in which a leader had to be decisive and act without consultation to achieve a particular objective.According to Lodge, [0]'s political thought reflected tensions between [0]'s support for liberal democracy and pre-colonial African forms of consensus decision making. [0] was an admirer of British-style parliamentary democracy, stating that \"[0] regard the British Parliament as the most democratic institution in the world, and the independence and impartiality of the British Parliament's judiciary never fail to arouse [0]'s admiration.\" In this [0] has been described as being committed to \"the Euro-North American modernist project of emancipation\", something which distinguishes [0] from other African nationalist and socialist leaders like Nyerere who were concerned about embracing styles of democratic governance that were Western, rather than African, in origin. [0] nevertheless also expressed admiration for what [0] deemed to be indigenous forms of democracy, describing Xhosa traditional society's mode of governance as \"democracy in its purest form\". [0] also spoke of an influential African ethical tenet, Ubuntu, which is a Ngnuni term meaning \"A person is a person through other persons\" or \"I am because we are.\"", "Socialism and Marxism": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] advocated the ultimate establishment of a classless society, with Sampson describing [0] as being \"openly opposed to capitalism, private land-ownership and the power of big money\". [0] was influenced by Marxism, and during the revolution [0] advocated scientific socialism. [0] denied being a communist at the Treason Trial, and maintained denied both when later talking to journalists, and in [0]'s autobiography, where [0] outlined that the cooperation with the SACP was pragmatic, asking rhetorically, \"who is to say that we were not using them?\" According to the sociologist Craig Soudien, \"sympathetic as [0] was to socialism, a communist [0] was not.\" Conversely, the biographer David Jones Smith stated that [0] \"embraced communism and communists\" in the late 1950s and early 1960s, while the historian Stephen Ellis commented that [0] had assimilated much of the Marxist\u2013Leninist ideology by the historian Stephen Ellis also found evidence that [0] had been an active member of the SACP during the late 1950s and early 1960s, something that was confirmed after [0]'s death by both the ANC and the SACP, the latter of which claimed that [0] was not only a member of the SACP, but also served on the SACP's Central Committee. [0]'s membership had been hidden by the ANC, aware that knowledge of [0]'s former the SACP involvement might have been detrimental to [0]'s attempts to attract support from Western countries. [0]'s view of Western countries differed from those of Marxist\u2013Leninists, for [0] did not believe that Western countries were anti-democratic or reactionary and remained committed to democratic systems of governance.The 1955 Freedom Charter, which [0] had helped create, called for the nationalisation of banks, gold mines and land, to ensure equal distribution of wealth. Despite these beliefs, [0] initiated a programme of privatisation during [0]'s presidency in line with trends in other countries of the time. It has been repeatedly suggested that [0] would have preferred to develop a social democratic economy in South Africa but that develop was not feasible as a result of the international political and economic situation during the early 1990s. This decision was in part influenced by the fall of the socialist states in the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc during the early 1990s."}, "Personality and personal life": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was widely considered a charismatic leader, described by biographer Mary Benson as \"a born mass leader who could not help magnetizing people\". [0] was highly image conscious and throughout his life always sought out fine quality clothes, with many commentators believing that [0] carried [0] in a regal manner. [0]'s aristocratic heritage was repeatedly emphasised by supporters, thus contributing to [0]'s \"charismatic power\". While living in Johannesburg in the 1950s, [0] cultivated the image of the \"African gentleman\", having \"the pressed clothes, correct manners, and modulated public speech\" associated with such a position.

[0] was fond of Indian cuisine, and had a lifelong interest in archaeology and boxing.The significance of [0] can be considered in two related ways. First, [0] has provided through [0]'s personal presence as a benign and honest conviction politician, skilled at exerting power but not obsessed with power to the point of view of excluding principles, a man who struggled to display respect to all ... Second, in so doing [0] was able to be a hero and a symbol to an array of otherwise unlikely mates through [0]'s ability, like all brilliant nationalist politicians, to speak to very different audiences effectively at once.\u2014\u2009Bill Freund, academicHe was raised in the Methodist denomination of Christianity; the Methodist Church of Southern Africa claimed that [0] retained [0]'s allegiance to the Methodist Church of Southern Africa throughout his life.

Outside of South Africa, [0] was a \"global icon\", with the scholar of South African studies Rita Barnard describing [0] as \"one of the most revered figures of our time\". One biographer considered [0] \"a modern democratic hero\". Some have portrayed [0] in messianic terms, in contrast to [0]'s own statement that \"[0] was not a messiah, but an ordinary man who had become a leader because of extraordinary circumstances.\" [0] is often cited alongside Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. as one of the 20th century's exemplary anti-racist and anti-colonial leaders. Boehmer described [0] as \"a totem of the totemic values of our age: toleration and liberal democracy\" and \"a universal symbol of social justice\".[0]'s international fame emerged during [0]'s incarceration in the 1980s, when [0] became the world's's most famous political prisoner, a symbol of the anti-apartheid cause, and an icon for millions who embraced the ideal of human equality. In 1986, [0]'s biographer characterised [0] as \"the embodiment of the struggle for liberation\" in South Africa. Meredith stated that in becoming \"a potent symbol of resistance\" to apartheid during the 1980s, [0] had gained \"mythical status\" internationally. Sampson commented that even during [0]'s life, \"mythical status\" internationally had become \"so powerful that \"mythical status\" internationally blurs the realities\", converting [0] into \"a secular saint\".

On the left, some voices in the ANC\u2014among them Frank B. Wilderson III\u2014accused [0] of selling out for agreeing to enter negotiations with apartheid and for not implementing the reforms of the Freedom Charter during his presidency. According to the scholar of South African studies Rita Barnard, \"there is also a sense in which [0]'s chiefly bearing and mode of conduct, the very respect and authority [0] accrued in representing South Africa in [0]'s own person, went against the spirit of democracy\", and concerns were similarly expressed that [0] placed [0]'s own status and celebrity above the transformation of South Africa. South Africa would be criticised for South Africa's failure to deal with both the HIV/AIDS pandemic and the high levels of poverty in South Africa. [0] was also criticised for [0]'s friendship with political leaders such as Fidel Castro and Muammar Gaddafi, who had supported the struggle against apartheid but were deemed dictators by critics.[unreliable source?]", "Orders, decorations, monuments, and honours": "[0] is our person to focus on.
