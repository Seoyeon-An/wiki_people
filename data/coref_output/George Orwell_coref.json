After school [0] became an Imperial policeman in Burma, before returning to Suffolk, England, where [0] began [0]'s writing career as George Orwell\u2014a name inspired by a favourite location, the River Orwell. [0] made a living from occasional pieces of journalism, and also worked as a teacher or bookseller while living in London. From the late 1920s to the early 1930s, [0]'s success as a writer grew and [0]'s first books were published.

During the Second World War [0] served as a sergeant in the Greenwich Home Guard (1940\u201341), worked as a journalist and, between 1941 and 1943, worked for the BBC.

In 2008, The Times ranked George Orwell second among \"The 50 greatest British writers since 1945\"."}, "Life": {"Early years": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was born on 25 June 1903 in Motihari, Bengal (now Bihar), British India into what [0] described as a \"lower-upper-middle class\" family. His great-great-grandfather, Charles Blair, was a wealthy slaveowning country gentleman and absentee owner of  two Jamaican plantations; hailing from Dorset, His great-great-grandfather, Charles Blair, married Lady Mary Fane, daughter of the 8th Earl of Westmorland. [0]'s grandfather, Thomas Richard Arthur Blair, was an Anglican clergyman. Orwell's father was Richard Walmesley Blair, who worked as a Sub-Deputy Opium Agent in the Opium Department of the Indian Civil Service, overseeing the production and storage of opium for sale to China. His mother, Ida Mabel Blair (n\u00e9e Limouzin), grew up in Moulmein, Burma, where His mother, Ida Mabel Blair (n\u00e9e Limouzin),'s French father was involved in speculative ventures. [0] had two sisters: Marjorie, five years older; and Avril, five years younger. When [0] was one year old, His mother, Ida Mabel Blair (n\u00e9e Limouzin), took [0] and Marjorie, five years older to England.[n 1] In 2014 restoration work began on [0]'s birthplace and ancestral house in Motihari, Bengal (now Bihar), British India.In 1904, His mother, Ida Mabel Blair (n\u00e9e Limouzin), settled with His mother, Ida Mabel Blair (n\u00e9e Limouzin),'s children at Henley-on-Thames in Oxfordshire. [0] was brought up in the company of His mother, Ida Mabel Blair (n\u00e9e Limouzin), and sisters and, apart from a brief visit in mid-1907, [0] did not see Orwell's father until 1912. Aged five, [0] was sent as a day-boy to a convent school in Henley-on-Thames, which Marjorie also attended. a convent school in Henley-on-Thames, which Marjorie also attended was a Roman Catholic convent run by French Ursuline nuns. His mother, Ida Mabel Blair (n\u00e9e Limouzin), wanted [0] to have a public school education, but his family could not afford the fees. Through the social connections of His mother, Ida Mabel Blair (n\u00e9e Limouzin),'s brother Charles Limouzin, [0] gained a scholarship to St Cyprian's School, Eastbourne, East Sussex. Arriving in September 1911, [0] boarded at St Cyprian's School, Eastbourne, East Sussex for the next five years, returning home only for school holidays. Although [0] knew nothing of the reduced fees, [0] \"soon recognised that [0] was from a poorer home\". [0] hated St Cyprian's School, Eastbourne, East Sussex and many years later wrote an essay \"Such, Such Were the Joys\", published posthumously, based on [0]'s time there. At St Cyprian's School, Eastbourne, East Sussex's, [0] first met Cyril Connolly, who became a writer and who, as the editor of Horizon, published several of Orwell's essays.Before the First World War, his family moved 2 miles (3\u00a0km) south to Shiplake, Oxfordshire, where [0] became friendly with the Buddicom family, especially their daughter Jacintha. When they first met, [0] was standing on [0]'s head in a field. Asked why, [0] said, \"You are noticed more if you stand on your head than if you are right way up.\" their daughter Jacintha [0] read and wrote poetry, and dreamed of becoming famous writers. [0] said that [0] might write a book in the style of H. G. Wells's A Modern Utopia. During this period, [0] also enjoyed shooting, fishing and birdwatching with their daughter Jacintha's brother and sister.While at St Cyprian's School, Eastbourne, East Sussex's, [0] wrote two poems that were published in the Henley and South Oxfordshire Standard. [0] came second to Cyril Connolly, who became a writer and who, as the editor of Horizon, published several of Orwell's essays in the Harrow History Prize, had [0]'s work praised by St Cyprian's School, Eastbourne, East Sussex's external examiner, and earned scholarships to Wellington and Eton. But inclusion on the Eton scholarship roll did not guarantee a place, and none was immediately available for [0]. [0] chose to stay at St Cyprian's School, Eastbourne, East Sussex's until December 1916, in case a place at Eton became available.In January, [0] took up the place at Wellington[0] . In May 1917 a place became available as a King's Scholar at Eton. At this time his family lived at Mall Chambers, Notting Hill Gate. [0] remained at Eton until December 1921, when [0] left midway between [0]'s 18th and 19th birthdays. Wellington was \"beastly\", [0] told their daughter Jacintha, but [0] said [0] was \"interested and happy\" at Eton. [0]'s principal tutor was A. S. F. Gow, Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, who also gave [0] advice later in [0]'s career. [0] was briefly taught French by Aldous Huxley. Steven Runciman, who was  at Eton with Blair, noted that Steven Runciman, who was  at Eton with Blair, and Steven Runciman, who was  at Eton with Blair,'s contemporaries appreciated Aldous Huxley's linguistic flair. Cyril Connolly, who became a writer and who, as the editor of Horizon, published several of Orwell's essays followed [0] to Eton, but because they were in separate years, they did not associate with each other.[0]'s academic performance reports suggest that [0] neglected [0]'s studies, but during [0]'s time at Eton [0] worked with Roger Mynors to produce a college magazine, The Election Times, joined in the production of other publications\u2014College Days and Bubble and Squeak\u2014and participated in the Eton Wall Game. His parents could not afford to send [0] to a university without another scholarship, and His parents concluded from [0]'s poor results that [0] would not be able to win one. Steven Runciman, who was  at Eton with Blair, noted that [0] had a romantic idea about the East, and his family decided that [0] should join the Imperial Police, the precursor of the Indian Police Service. For join [0] had to pass an entrance examination. In December 1921 [0] left Eton and travelled to join [0]'s retired father, mother, and younger sister Avril, who December 1921 had moved to 40 Stradbroke Road, Southwold, Suffolk, the first of his family's four homes in Suffolk. [0] was enrolled at a crammer there called Craighurst, and brushed up on [0]'s Classics, English, and History. [0] passed an entrance examination, coming seventh out of the 26 candidates who exceeded the pass mark.", "Policing in Burma": "George Orwell is our person to focus on. [0]'s maternal grandmother lived at Moulmein, so [0] chose a posting in Burma, then still a province of British India. In October 1922 [0] sailed on board SS Herefordshire via the Suez Canal and Ceylon to join the Indian Imperial Police in Burma, then still a province of British India. A month later, [0] arrived at Rangoon and travelled to the police training school in Mandalay. [0] was appointed an Assistant District Superintendent (on probation) on 29 November 1922, with effect from 27 November and at the pay of Rs. 525 per month. After a short posting at Maymyo, Burma, then still a province of British India's principal hill station, [0] was posted to the frontier outpost of Myaungmya in the Irrawaddy Delta at the beginning of 1924.Working as an imperial police officer gave [0] considerable responsibility while most of [0]'s contemporaries were still at university in England. When [0] was posted farther east in the Irrawaddy Delta to Twante as a sub-divisional officer, [0] was responsible for the security of some 200,000 people. At the end of 1924, [0] was posted to Syriam, closer to Rangoon. Syriam, closer to Rangoon had the refinery of the Burmah Oil Company, \"the surrounding land a barren waste, all vegetation killed off by the fumes of sulphur dioxide pouring out day and night from the stacks of the refinery of the Burmah Oil Company.\" But Syriam, closer to Rangoon was near Rangoon, and [0] went into Rangoon as often as [0] could, \"to browse in a bookshop; to eat well-cooked food; to get away from the boring routine of police life\". In September 1925 [0] went to Insein, the home of Insein Prison, the second largest prison in Burma. In Insein, the home of Insein Prison, the second largest prison in Burma, [0] had \"long talks on every conceivable subject\" with Elisa Maria Langford-Rae (who later married Kazi Lhendup Dorjee). Elisa Maria Langford-Rae (who later married Kazi Lhendup Dorjee) noted [0]'s \"sense of utter fairness in minutest details\". By this time, [0] had completed [0]'s training and was receiving a monthly salary of Rs. 740, including allowances.[0] recalled [0] faced hostility from the Burmese, \"in the end the sneering yellow faces of young men that met [0] everywhere, the insults hooted after [0] when [0] was at a safe distance, got badly on [0]'s nerves\". [0] recalled that \"[0] was stuck between [0]'s hatred of British India and [0]'s rage against the evil-spirited little beasts who tried to make [0]'s job impossible\".In Burma, then still a province of British India, [0] acquired a reputation as an outsider. [0] spent much of [0]'s time alone, reading or pursuing non-pukka activities, such as attending the churches of the Karen ethnic group. A colleague, Roger Beadon, recalled (in a 1969 recording for the BBC) that [0] was fast to learn the language and that before [0] left Burma, then still a province of British India, \"was able to speak fluently with Burmese priests in 'very high-flown Burmese'.\" [0] made changes to [0]'s appearance in Burma, then still a province of British India that remained for the rest of [0]'s life, including adopting a pencil moustache. Emma Larkin writes in the introduction to Burmese Days, \"While in Burma, then still a province of British India, [0] acquired a moustache similar to those worn by officers of the British regiments stationed there. [[0]] also acquired some tattoos; on each knuckle [0] had a small untidy blue circle. Many Burmese living in rural areas still sport tattoos like this\u2014tattoos like this are believed to protect against bullets and snake bites.\"In April 1926 [0] moved to Moulmein[0]'s . At the end of 1926, [0] was assigned to Katha in Upper Burma, where [0] contracted dengue fever in 1927. Entitled to a leave in England 1927, [0] was allowed to return in July due to dengue fever. While on leave in England and on holiday with [0]'s family in Cornwall in September 1927, [0] reappraised [0]'s life. Deciding against returning to Burma, then still a province of British India, [0] resigned from the Indian Imperial Police to become a writer, with effect from 12 March 1928 after five-and-a-half years of service. [0] drew on [0]'s experiences in the Indian Imperial Police for the novel Burmese Days (1934) and the essays \"A Hanging\" (1931) and \"Shooting an Elephant\" (1936).", "London and Paris": "George Orwell is our person to focus on. In England, [0] settled back in the family home at Southwold, renewing acquaintance with local friends and attending an Old Etonian dinner. [0] visited [0]'s old tutor Gow at Cambridge for advice on becoming a writer. In 1927 [0] moved to London. Ruth Pitter, a family acquaintance, helped [0] find lodgings, and by the end of 1927 [0] had moved into rooms in Portobello Road; a blue plaque commemorates [0]'s residence there. Ruth Pitter, a family acquaintance,'s involvement in moved \"would have lent moved a reassuring respectability in Mrs. Blair's eyes.\" Ruth Pitter, a family acquaintance, had a sympathetic interest in [0]'s writing, pointed out weaknesses in [0]'s poetry, and advised [0] to write about what [0] knew. In fact [0] decided to write of \"certain aspects of the present that [0] set out to know\" and ventured into the East End of London\u2014venturedthe world of poverty the world of poverty. [0] had found a subject. These sorties, explorations, expeditions, tours or immersions were made intermittently over a period of five years.In imitation of Jack London, whose writing [0] admired (particularly The People of the Abyss), [0] started to explore the poorer parts of London. On [0]'s first outing [0] set out to Limehouse Causeway, spending [0]'s first night in a common lodging house, possibly George Levy's \"kip\". For a while [0] \"went native\" in [0]'s own country, dressing like a tramp, adopting the name P.S. Burton and making no concessions to middle-class mores and expectations; [0] recorded [0]'s experiences of the low life for use in \"The Spike\", [0]'s first published essay in English, and in the second half of [0]'s first book, Down and Out in Paris and London (1933).In early 1928 [0] moved to Paris. [0] lived in the rue du Pot de Fer, a working class district in the 5th arrondissement. [0]'s aunt Ellen (Nellie) Kate Limouzin also lived in Paris (with the Esperantist Eug\u00e8ne Lanti) and gave [0] social and, when necessary, financial support. [0] began to write novels, including an early version of Burmese Days, but nothing else survives from that period. [0] was more successful as a journalist and published articles in Monde, a political/literary journal edited by Henri Barbusse ([0]'s first article as a professional writer, \"La Censure en Angleterre\", appeared in Monde, a political/literary journal edited by Henri Barbusse on 6 October 1928); G. K.'s Weekly, where [0]'s first article to appear in England, \"A Farthing Newspaper\", was printed on 29 December 1928; and Le Progr\u00e8s Civique (founded by the left-wing coalition Le Cartel des Gauches). Three pieces appeared in successive weeks in Le Progr\u00e8s Civique (founded by the left-wing coalition Le Cartel des Gauches): discussing unemployment, a day in the life of a tramp, and the beggars of London, respectively. \"In one or another of its destructive forms, poverty was to become [0]'s obsessive subject\u2014at the heart of almost everything [0] wrote until Homage to Catalonia.[0] fell seriously ill in February 1929 and was taken to the H\u00f4pital Cochin in the 14th arrondissement, a free hospital where medical students were trained. [0]'s experiences there were the basis of [0]'s essay \"How the Poor Die\", published in 1946. [0] chose not to identify the H\u00f4pital Cochin in the 14th arrondissement, a free hospital where medical students were trained, and indeed was deliberately misleading about the H\u00f4pital Cochin in the 14th arrondissement, a free hospital where medical students were trained's location. Shortly afterwards, [0] had all [0]'s money stolen from [0]'s lodging house. Whether through necessity or to collect material, [0] undertook menial jobs such as dishwashing in a fashionable hotel on the rue de Rivoli, which [0] later described in Down and Out in Paris and London. In August 1929, [0] sent a copy of \"The Spike\" to John Middleton Murry's New Adelphi magazine in London. John Middleton Murry's New Adelphi magazine in London was edited by Max Plowman and Sir Richard Rees, and Max Plowman accepted \"The Spike\" for publication.", "Southwold": "George Orwell is our person to focus on. In December 1929 after nearly two years in Paris, [0] returned to England and went directly to his parents' house in Southwold, a coastal town in Suffolk, which remained his base for the next five years. The family was well established in Southwold, a coastal town in Suffolk, which remained his base for the next five years, and [0]'s sister Avril was running a tea-house there. [0] became acquainted with many local people, including Brenda Salkeld, the clergyman's daughter who worked as a gym-teacher at St Felix Girls' School in the town. Although Brenda Salkeld, the clergyman's daughter who worked as a gym-teacher at St Felix Girls' School in the town rejected [0]'s offer of marriage, Brenda Salkeld, the clergyman's daughter who worked as a gym-teacher at St Felix Girls' School in the town remained a friend and regular correspondent for many years. [0] also renewed friendships with older friends, such as Dennis Collings, whose girlfriend Eleanor Jacques was also to play a part in [0]'s life.In early 1930 [0] stayed briefly in Bramley, Leeds, with his sister Marjorie and his sister Marjorie's husband Humphrey Dakin, who was as unappreciative of [0] as when they knew they as children. [0] was writing reviews for Adelphi and acting as a private tutor to a disabled child at Southwold, a coastal town in Suffolk, which remained his base for the next five years. [0] then became tutor to three young brothers, one of whom, Richard Peters, later became a distinguished academic. \"[0]'s history in the next five years is marked by dualities and contrasts. There is Blair leading a respectable, outwardly eventless life at his parents' house in Southwold, a coastal town in Suffolk, which remained his base for the next five years, writing; then in contrast, there is Blair as Burton (the name [0] used in [0]'s down-and-out episodes) in search of experience in the kips and spikes, in the East End, on the road, and in the hop fields of Kent.\" [0] went painting and bathing on the beach, and there [0] met Mabel and Francis Fierz, who later influenced his career. Over the next year [0] visited Mabel and Francis Fierz, who later influenced his career in London, often meeting Mabel and Francis Fierz, who later influenced his career's friend Max Plowman. [0] also often stayed at the homes of Ruth Pitter and Richard Rees, where [0] could \"change\" for [0]'s sporadic tramping expeditions. One of [0]'s jobs was domestic work at a lodgings for half a crown (two shillings and sixpence, or one-eighth of a pound) a day.[0] now contributed regularly to Adelphi, with \"A Hanging\" appearing in August 1931. From August 1931 to September 1931 [0]'s explorations of poverty continued, and, like the protagonist of A Clergyman's Daughter, [0] followed the East End tradition of working in the Kent hop fields. [0] kept a diary about [0]'s experiences there. Afterwards, [0] lodged in the Tooley Street kip, but could not stand it for long, and with financial help from [0]'s parents moved to Windsor Street, where [0] stayed until Christmas. \"Hop Picking\", by [0], appeared in the October 1931 issue of New Statesman, whose editorial staff included [0]'s old friend Cyril Connolly. Mabel Fierz put [0] in contact with Leonard Moore, who became his literary agent in April 1932.At this time Jonathan Cape Leonard Moore, who became his literary agent in April 1932.At this time Jonathan Cape rejected A Scullion's Diary, the first version of Down and Out. On the advice of Richard Rees, Leonard Moore, who became his literary agent in April 1932.At this time Jonathan Cape offered A Scullion's Diary, the first version of Down and Out to Faber and Faber, but Faber and Faber's editorial director, T. S. Eliot, also rejected A Scullion's Diary, the first version of Down and Out. [0] ended 1931 by deliberately getting [0] arrested, so that [0] could experience Christmas in prison, but after [0] was picked up and taken to Bethnal Green police station in the East End of London the authorities did not regard [0]'s \"drunk and disorderly\" behaviour as imprisonable, and after two days in a cell [0] returned home to Southwold, a coastal town in Suffolk, which remained his base for the next five years.", "Teaching career": "George Orwell is our person to focus on. In April 1932 Blair became a teacher at [0]. [0] was a small school offering private schooling for children of local tradesmen and shopkeepers, and had only 14 or 16 boys aged between ten and sixteen, and one other master. While at [0] Blair became friendly with the curate of the local parish church and became involved with activities there. Mabel Fierz had pursued matters with Moore, and at the end of June 1932, Moore told Blair that Victor Gollancz was prepared to publish A Scullion's Diary for a \u00a340 advance, through Victor Gollancz's recently founded publishing house, Victor Gollancz Ltd, which was an outlet for radical and socialist works.At the end of the summer term in 1932, Blair returned to Southwold, where his parents had used a legacy to buy their own home. Blair and Blair's sister Avril spent the holidays making their own home habitable while Blair also worked on Burmese Days. Blair was also spending time with Eleanor Jacques, but Eleanor Jacques's attachment to Dennis Collings remained an obstacle to Blair's hopes of a more serious relationship.\"Clink\", an essay describing Blair's failed attempt to get sent to prison, appeared in the August 1932 number of Adelphi. Blair returned to teaching at Hayes, West London and prepared for the publication of his book, now known as Down and Out in Paris and London. Blair wished to publish under a different name to avoid any embarrassment to Blair's family over Blair's time as a \"tramp\". In a letter to Moore (dated 15 November 1932), Blair left the choice of pseudonym to Moore and to Victor Gollancz. Four days later, Blair wrote to Moore, suggesting the pseudonyms P. S. Burton (a name Blair used when tramping), Kenneth Miles, George Orwell, and H. Lewis Allways. Blair finally adopted George Orwell because \"George Orwell is a good round English name.\" George Orwell was inspired by the patron saint of England, and Orwell after the River Orwell in Suffolk which was one of George Orwell's favourite locations.his book, now known as Down and Out in Paris and London was published by Victor Gollancz in London on 9 January 1933 and received favourable reviews, with Cecil Day-Lewis complimenting George Orwell's \"clarity and good sense\", and The Times Literary Supplement comparing George Orwell's eccentric characters to the characters of Dickens. his book, now known as Down and Out in Paris and London was modestly successful and was next published by Harper & Brothers in New York.In mid-1933 Blair left [0] to become a teacher at Frays College, in Uxbridge, west London. Frays College, in Uxbridge, west London was a much larger establishment with 200 pupils and a full complement of staff. Blair acquired a motorcycle and took trips through the surrounding countryside. On one of trips Blair became soaked and caught a chill that developed into pneumonia. Blair was taken to a cottage hospital in Uxbridge, west London, where for a time Blair's life was believed to be in danger. When Blair was discharged in January 1934, Blair returned to Southwold, where his parents had used a legacy to buy their own home to convalesce and, supported by Blair's parents, never returned to teaching.Blair was disappointed when Victor Gollancz turned down Burmese Days, mainly on the grounds of potential suits for libel, but Harper & Brothers in New York were prepared to publish Burmese Days in the United States. Meanwhile, Blair started work on the novel A Clergyman's Daughter, drawing upon Blair's life as a teacher and on life in Southwold, where his parents had used a legacy to buy their own home. Eleanor Jacques was now married and had gone to Singapore and Brenda Salkeld had left for Ireland, so Blair was relatively isolated in Southwold, where his parents had used a legacy to buy their own home\u2014working on the allotments, walking alone and spending time with Blair's father. Eventually in October, after sending A Clergyman's Daughter to Moore, Blair left for London to take a job that had been found for Blair by Blair's aunt Nellie Limouzin.", "Hampstead": "George Orwell is our person to focus on.

A Clergyman's Daughter was published on 11 March 1935. In early 1935 him met him's future wife Eileen O'Shaughnessy, when his landlady, Rosalind Obermeyer, who was studying for a master's degree in psychology at University College London, invited some of her fellow students his landlady, Rosalind Obermeyer, who was studying for a master's degree in psychology at University College London,'s to a party.

In August, him moved into a flat, at 50 Lawford Road, Kentish Town, which him shared with Michael Sayers and Rayner Heppenstall. The relationship was sometimes awkward and Blair and Heppenstall even came to blows, though Blair and Heppenstall remained friends and later worked together on BBC broadcasts. him was now working on Keep the Aspidistra Flying, and also tried unsuccessfully to write a serial for the News Chronicle. By October 1935 him's flatmates had moved out and him was struggling to pay the rent on him's own. him remained until the end of January 1936, when him stopped working at Booklovers' Corner. In 1980, English Heritage honoured George Orwell with a blue plaque at George Orwell's Kentish Town residence.", "The Road to Wigan Pier": "[0] is our person to focus on. At this time, Victor Gollancz suggested [0] spend a short time investigating social conditions in economically depressed Northern England.[n 2] Two years earlier, J. B. Priestley had written about England north of the Trent, sparking an interest in reportage. The Depression had also introduced a number of working-class writers from the North of England to the reading public. It was one of these working-class authors, Jack Hilton, whom Orwell sought for advice. [0] had written to one of these working-class authors, Jack Hilton, whom Orwell sought for advice seeking lodging and asking for recommendations on [0]'s route. one of these working-class authors, Jack Hilton, whom Orwell sought for advice was unable to provide [0] lodging, but suggested that [0] travel to Wigan rather than Rochdale, \"for there are the colliers and the colliers're good stuff.\"On 31 January 1936, [0] set out by public transport and on foot, reaching Manchester via Coventry, Stafford, the Potteries and Macclesfield.

One of contacts sent by Richard Rees, the trade union official Frank Meade, suggested Wigan[0] . In Wigan, [0] visited many homes to see how people lived, took detailed notes of housing conditions and wages earned, went down Bryn Hall coal mine, and used the local public library to consult public health records and reports on working conditions in mines.During this time, [0] was distracted by concerns about style and possible libel in Keep the Aspidistra Flying. [0] made a quick visit to Liverpool and during March, stayed in south Yorkshire, spending time in Sheffield and Barnsley. As well as visiting mines, including Grimethorpe, and observing social conditions, [0] attended meetings of the Communist Party and of Oswald Mosley (\"Oswald Mosley's speech the usual claptrap\u2014The blame for everything was put upon mysterious international gangs of Jews\") where [0] saw the tactics of the Blackshirts (\"...one is liable to get both a hammering and a fine for asking a question which Oswald Mosley finds it difficult to answer.\"). [0] also made visits to [0]'s sister at Headingley, during which [0] visited the Bront\u00eb Parsonage at Haworth, where [0] was \"chiefly impressed by a pair of Charlotte Bront\u00eb's cloth-topped boots, very small, with square toes and lacing up at the sides.[0] needed somewhere [0] could concentrate on writing [0]'s book, and once again help was provided by Aunt Nellie, who was living at Wallington, Hertfordshire in a very small 16th-century cottage called the \"Stores\".

[0] started work on The Road to Wigan Pier by the end of 2 April 1936, but also spent hours working on the garden, planting a rose garden which is still extant, and revealing four years later that \"outside [0]'s work the thing [0] care most about is gardening, especially vegetable gardening\". [0] also tested the possibility of reopening a very small 16th-century cottage called the \"Stores\" as a village shop. Keep the Aspidistra Flying was published by Victor Gollancz on 20 April 1936. On 4 August, [0] gave a talk at the Adelphi Summer School held at Langham, entitled An Outsider Sees the Distressed Areas; others who spoke at the Adelphi Summer School held at Langham included John Strachey, Max Plowman, Karl Polanyi and Reinhold Niebuhr.The result of [0]'s journeys through the north was The Road to Wigan Pier, published by Gollancz for the Left Book Club in 1937. The first half of The Road to Wigan Pier, published by Gollancz for the Left Book Club in 1937 documents [0]'s social investigations of Lancashire and south Yorkshire, including an evocative description of working life in the coal mines. The second half is a long essay on [0]'s upbringing and the development of [0]'s political conscience, which includes an argument for socialism (although [0] goes to lengths to balance the concerns and goals of socialism with the barriers socialism faced from socialism's own advocates at the time, such as \"priggish\" and \"dull\" socialist intellectuals and \"proletarian\" socialists with little grasp of the actual ideology). Victor Gollancz feared The second half would offend readers and added a disculpatory preface to The Road to Wigan Pier, published by Gollancz for the Left Book Club in 1937 while [0] was in Spain.[0]'s research for The Road to Wigan Pier led to [0] being placed under surveillance by the Special Branch from 1936, for 12 years, until one year before the publication of Nineteen Eighty-Four.[0] married Eileen O'Shaughnessy on 9 June 1936. Shortly afterwards, the political crisis began in Spain and [0] followed developments there closely. At the end of 1936, concerned by Francisco Franco's military uprising (supported by Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy and local groups such as Falange), [0] decided to go to Spain to take part in the Spanish Civil War on the Republican side. Under the erroneous impression that [0] needed papers from some left-wing organisation to cross the frontier, on John Strachey's recommendation [0] applied unsuccessfully to Harry Pollitt, leader of the British Communist Party. Harry Pollitt, leader of the British Communist Party was suspicious of [0]'s political reliability; Harry Pollitt, leader of the British Communist Party asked [0] whether [0] would undertake to join the International Brigade and advised [0] to get a safe-conduct from the Spanish Embassy in Paris. Not wishing to commit [0] until [0] had seen the situation in situ, [0] instead used [0]'s Independent Labour Party contacts to get a letter of introduction to John McNair in Barcelona.", "Spanish Civil War": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] set out for Spain on about 23 December 1936, dining with Henry Miller in Paris on the way. Henry Miller told [0] that going to fight in the Civil War out of some sense of obligation or guilt was \"sheer stupidity\" and that the Englishman's ideas \"about combating Fascism, defending democracy, etc., etc., were all baloney\". A few days later in Barcelona, [0] met John McNair of the Independent Labour Party (ILP) Office who quoted [0]: \"[0]'ve come to fight against Fascism\", but if someone had asked [0] what [0] was fighting for, \"[0] should have answered: 'Common decency'\". [0] stepped into a complex political situation in Catalonia. The Republican government was supported by a number of factions with conflicting aims, including the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM\u00a0\u2013 Partido Obrero de Unificaci\u00f3n Marxista), the anarcho-syndicalist Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) and the Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia (a wing of the Spanish Communist Party, which was backed by Soviet arms and aid). [0] was at first exasperated by this \"kaleidoscope\" of political parties and trade unions, \"with their tiresome names\". Independent Labour Party (ILP) was linked to the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM\u00a0\u2013 Partido Obrero de Unificaci\u00f3n Marxista) so [0] joined the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM\u00a0\u2013 Partido Obrero de Unificaci\u00f3n Marxista) a time at the Lenin Barracks in Barcelona [0] was sent to the relatively quiet Aragon Front under Georges Kopp. By January 1937 [0] was at Alcubierre 1,500 feet (460\u00a0m) above sea level, in the depth of winter. There was very little military action and [0] was shocked by the lack of munitions, food and firewood as well as other extreme deprivations. With [0]'s Cadet Corps and police training, [0] was quickly made a corporal. On the arrival of a British ILP Contingent Independent Labour Party (ILP) about three weeks later, [0] and the other English militiaman, Williams, were sent with a British ILP Contingent to Monte Oscuro. a British ILP Contingent Independent Labour Party (ILP) included Bob Smillie, Bob Edwards, Stafford Cottman and Jack Branthwaite. a British ILP Contingent was then sent on to Huesca.Meanwhile, back in England, Eileen had been handling the issues relating to the publication of The Road to Wigan Pier before setting out for Spain Eileen, leaving Nellie Limouzin to look after The Stores. Eileen volunteered for a post in John McNair's office and with the help of Georges Kopp paid visits to [0], bringing [0] English tea, chocolate and cigars. [0] had to spend some days in hospital with a poisoned hand and had most of [0]'s possessions stolen by the staff. [0] returned to the front and saw some action in a night attack on the Nationalist trenches where [0] chased an enemy soldier with a bayonet and bombed an enemy rifle position.In April, [0] returned to Barcelona. Wanting to be sent to the Madrid front, which meant [0] \"must join the International Column\", [0] approached a Communist friend attached to the Spanish Medical Aid and explained [0]'s case. \"Although [0] did not think much of the Communists, [0] was still ready to treat the Communists as friends and allies. treat would soon change.\" This was the time of the Barcelona May Days and [0] was caught up in the factional fighting. [0] spent much of the time on a roof, with a stack of novels, but encountered Jon Kimche from [0]'s Hampstead days during the stay. The subsequent campaign of lies and distortion carried out by the Communist press, in which the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM\u00a0\u2013 Partido Obrero de Unificaci\u00f3n Marxista) was accused of collaborating with the fascists, had a dramatic effect on [0]. Instead of joining the International Brigades as [0] had intended, [0] decided to return to the Aragon Front. Once the May fighting was over, [0] was approached by a Communist friend who asked if [0] still intended transferring to the International Brigades. [0] expressed surprise that the International Brigades should still want [0], because according to the Communist press [0] was a fascist. \"No one who was in Barcelona then, or for months later, will forget the horrible atmosphere produced by fear, suspicion, hatred, censored newspapers, crammed jails, enormous food queues and prowling gangs of armed men.\"After [0]'s return to the front, [0] was wounded in the throat by a sniper's bullet. At 6\u00a0ft 2 in (1.88 m), [0] was considerably taller than the Spanish fighters and had been warned against standing against the trench parapet. Unable to speak, and with blood pouring from [0]'s mouth, [0] was carried on a stretcher to Si\u00e9tamo, loaded on an ambulance and after a bumpy journey via Barbastro arrived at the hospital in Lleida. [0] recovered sufficiently to get up and on 27 May 1937 was sent on to Tarragona and two days later to a the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM\u00a0\u2013 Partido Obrero de Unificaci\u00f3n Marxista) sanatorium in the suburbs of Barcelona. The bullet had missed [0]'s main artery by the barest margin and [0]'s voice was barely audible. The bullet had been such a clean shot that the wound immediately went through the process of cauterisation. [0] received electrotherapy treatment and was declared medically unfit for service.By the middle of June, the political situation in Barcelona had deteriorated and the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM\u00a0\u2013 Partido Obrero de Unificaci\u00f3n Marxista)was outlawed and under attack. The Communist line was that the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM\u00a0\u2013 Partido Obrero de Unificaci\u00f3n Marxista) were \"objectively\" Fascist, hindering the Republican cause. \"A particularly nasty poster appeared, showing a head with a the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM\u00a0\u2013 Partido Obrero de Unificaci\u00f3n Marxista) mask being ripped off to reveal a Swastika-covered face beneath.\" Members, including Georges Kopp, were arrested and others were in hiding. Orwell and his wife were under threat and had to lie low,[n 3] although Orwell and his wife broke cover to try to help Georges Kopp.Finally with Orwell and his wife's passports in order, Orwell and his wife escaped from Spain by train, diverting to Banyuls-sur-Mer for a short stay before returning to England. In the first week of July 1937 [0] arrived back at Wallington; on 13 July 1937 a deposition was presented to the Tribunal for Espionage & High Treason in Valencia, charging Orwell and his wife with \"rabid Trotskyism\", and being agents of the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM\u00a0\u2013 Partido Obrero de Unificaci\u00f3n Marxista). The trial of the leaders of the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM\u00a0\u2013 Partido Obrero de Unificaci\u00f3n Marxista) and of [0] (in [0]'s absence) took place in Barcelona in October and November 1938. Observing events from French Morocco, [0] wrote that events were \"only a by-product of the Russian Trotskyist trials and from the start every kind of lie, including flagrant absurdities, has been circulated in the Communist press.\" [0]'s experiences in the Spanish Civil War gave rise to Homage to Catalonia (1938).In his's book, The International Brigades: Fascism, Freedom and the Spanish Civil War, his writes that according to Soviet files, [0] and his wife were spied on in Barcelona in May 1937. \"Soviet files are documentary evidence that not only [0], but also his wife, were being watched closely\".", "Rest and recuperation": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] returned to England in June 1937, and stayed at the O'Shaughnessy home at Greenwich. [0] found his views on the Spanish Civil War out of favour. Kingsley Martin rejected two of [0]'s works and Gollancz was equally cautious. At the same time, the communist Daily Worker was running an attack on The Road to Wigan Pier, taking out of context [0] writing that \"the working classes smell\"; a letter to Gollancz from [0] threatening libel action brought a stop to this. [0] was also able to find a more sympathetic publisher for his views on the Spanish Civil War in Fredric Warburg of Secker & Warburg. [0] returned to Wallington, which he found in disarray after his absence. [0] acquired goats, a cockerel (rooster) [0] called Henry Ford and a poodle puppy [0] called Marx; and settled down to animal husbandry and writing Homage to Catalonia.There were thoughts of going to India to work on The Pioneer, a newspaper in Lucknow, but by March 1938 Orwell's health had deteriorated. [0] was admitted to Preston Hall Sanatorium at Aylesford, Kent, a British Legion hospital for ex-servicemen to which [0]'s brother-in-law Laurence O'Shaughnessy was attached. [0] was thought initially to be suffering from tuberculosis and stayed in Preston Hall Sanatorium at Aylesford, Kent until September. A stream of visitors came to see [0], including Common, Heppenstall, Plowman and Cyril Connolly. Cyril Connolly brought with Cyril Connolly Stephen Spender, a cause of some embarrassment as [0] had referred to Stephen Spender as a \"pansy friend\" some time earlier. Homage to Catalonia was published in London by Secker & Warburg and was a commercial flop; Homage to Catalonia re-emerged in the 1950s, following on the success of [0]'s later books. In the latter part of [0]'s stay at Preston Hall Sanatorium at Aylesford, Kent, [0] was able to go for walks in the countryside and study nature.The novelist L. H. Myers secretly funded a trip to French Morocco for half a year for [0] to avoid the English winter and recover Orwell's health. The Orwells set out in September via Gibraltar and Tangier to avoid Spanish Morocco and arrived at Marrakech. The Orwells rented a villa on the road to Casablanca and during that time [0] wrote Coming Up for Air. The Orwells arrived back in England on 30 March 1939 and Coming Up for Air was published in June. [0] spent time in Wallington, which he found in disarray after his absence and Southwold working on a Dickens essay and it was in June that [0]'s father, Richard Blair, died.", "Second World War and Animal Farm": "[0] is our person to focus on. At the outbreak of the Second World War, Orwell's wife Eileen started working in the Censorship Department of the Ministry of Information in central London, staying during the week with Orwell's wife Eileen's in Greenwich. [0] also submitted [0]'s name to the Central Register for war work, but nothing transpired. \"They won't have [0] in the army, at any rate at present, because of [0]'s lungs\", [0] told Geoffrey Gorer. [0] returned to Wallington, and in late 1939 [0] wrote material for [0]'s first collection of essays, Inside the Whale. For the next year [0] was occupied writing reviews for plays, films and books for The Listener, Time and Tide and New Adelphi. On 29 March 1940 [0]'s long association with Tribune began with a review of a sergeant's account of Napoleon's retreat from Moscow. At the beginning of 1940, the first edition of Connolly's Horizon appeared, and Connolly's Horizon provided a new outlet for [0]'s work as well as new literary contacts. In May the Orwells took lease of a flat in London at Dorset Chambers, Chagford Street, Marylebone. 1940 was the time of the Dunkirk evacuation, and the death in Flanders, France of Orwell's wife Eileen's brother, Dr. Laurence O'Shaughnessy, caused Orwell's wife Eileen's considerable grief and long-term depression.  Throughout this period [0] kept a wartime diary.[0] was declared \"unfit for any kind of military service\" by the Medical Board in June, but soon afterwards found an opportunity to become involved in war activities by joining the British Home Guard. [0] shared Tom Wintringham's socialist vision for the British Home Guard as a revolutionary People's Militia. [0]'s lecture notes for instructing platoon members include advice on street fighting, field fortifications, and the use of mortars of various kinds. [0] managed to recruit Fredric Warburg to [0]'s unit. During the Battle of Britain [0] used to spend weekends with Fredric Warburg and Fredric Warburg's new Zionist friend, Tosco Fyvel, at Fredric Warburg's house at Twyford, Berkshire. At Wallington [0] worked on \"England Your England\" and in London wrote reviews for various periodicals. Visiting Orwell's wife Eileen's family in Greenwich brought [0] face-to-face with the effects of the Blitz on East London. In mid-1940, Fredric Warburg, Fyvel and [0] planned Searchlight Books. Eleven volumes eventually appeared, of which [0]'s The Lion and the Unicorn: Socialism and the English Genius, published on 19 February 1941, was the first.Early in 1941 [0] began to write for the American Partisan Review which linked [0] with The New York Intellectuals who were also anti-Stalinist, and contributed to the Gollancz anthology The Betrayal of the Left, written in the light of the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact (although [0] referred to the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact as the Russo-German Pact and the Hitler-Stalin Pact). [0] also applied unsuccessfully for a job at the Air Ministry. Meanwhile, [0] was still writing reviews of books and plays and at this time met the novelist Anthony Powell. [0] also took part in a few radio broadcasts for the Eastern Service of the BBC. In March the Orwells moved to a seventh-floor flat at Langford Court, St John's Wood, while at Wallington [0] was \"digging for victory\" by planting potatoes.\"One could not have a better example of the moral and emotional shallowness of our time, than the fact that we are now all more or less pro Stalin. Stalin is temporarily on we's side, and so the purges, etc., are suddenly forgotten.\" In August 1941, [0] finally obtained \"war work\" when [0] was taken on full-time by the Eastern Service of the BBC. When interviewed for the job [0] indicated that [0] \"accept[ed] absolutely the need for propaganda to be directed by the government\" and stressed [0]'s view that, in wartime, discipline in the execution of government policy was essential. [0] supervised cultural broadcasts to India to counter propaganda from Nazi Germany designed to undermine imperial links. This was [0]'s first experience of the rigid conformity of life in an office, and This gave [0] an opportunity to create cultural programmes with contributions from T. S. Eliot, Dylan Thomas, E. M. Forster, Ahmed Ali, Mulk Raj Anand, and William Empson among others.At the end of August 1941 [0] had a dinner with H. G. Wells which degenerated into a row because H. G. Wells had taken offence at observations [0] made about H. G. Wells in a Horizon article. In October [0] had a bout of bronchitis and bronchitis recurred frequently. David Astor was looking for a provocative contributor for The Observer and invited [0] to write for David Astor\u2014the first article appearing in March 1942. In early 1942 Orwell's wife Eileen changed jobs to work at the Ministry of Food and in mid-1942 the Orwells moved to a larger flat, a ground floor and basement, 10a Mortimer Crescent in Maida Vale/Kilburn\u2014\"the kind of lower-middle-class ambience that [0] thought was London at London's best.\" Around the same time Orwell's mother and sister Avril, who had found work in a sheet-metal factory behind King's Cross Station, moved into a flat close to the OrwellsOrwell's wife Eileen.At the BBC, [0] introduced Voice, a literary programme for his Indian broadcasts, and by now was leading an active social life with literary friends, particularly on the political left. Late in 1941, [0] started writing regularly for the left-wing weekly Tribune:\u200a306\u200a:\u200a441\u200a directed by Labour MPs Aneurin Bevan and George Strauss. In March 1943, Orwell's mother died, and around the same time [0] told Moore [0] was starting work on a new book, which turned out to be Animal Farm.In September 1943, [0] resigned from the the BBC post that [0] had occupied for two years.:\u200a352\u200a [0]'s followed a report confirming [0]'s fears that few Indians listened to his Indian broadcasts, but [0] was also keen to concentrate on writing a new book, which turned out to be Animal Farm. On 24 November 1943, six days before [0]'s last day of service, [0]'s adaptation of the fairy tale, Hans Christian Andersen's The Emperor's New Clothes was broadcast. the fairy tale, Hans Christian Andersen's The Emperor's New Clothes was a genre in which [0] was greatly interested and which appeared on a new book, which turned out to be Animal Farm's title page. At this time [0] also resigned from the Home Guard on medical grounds.In November 1943, [0] was appointed literary editor at Tribune, where [0]'s assistant was [0]'s old friend Jon Kimche. [0] was on staff until early 1945, writing over 80 book reviews and on 3 December 1943 started [0]'s regular personal column, \"As [0] Please\", usually addressing three or four subjects in each. [0] was still writing reviews for other magazines, including Partisan Review, Horizon, and the New York Nation and becoming a respected pundit among left-wing circles but also a close friend of people on the right such as the novelist Anthony Powell, David Astor and Malcolm Muggeridge. By April 1944 a new book, which turned out to be Animal Farm was ready for publication. Gollancz refused to publish a new book, which turned out to be Animal Farm, considering a new book, which turned out to be Animal Farm an attack on the Soviet regime which was a crucial ally in the Second World War. A similar fate was met from other publishers (including T. S. Eliot at Faber and Faber) until Jonathan Cape agreed to take a new book, which turned out to be Animal Farm.In May the Orwells had the opportunity to adopt a child, thanks to the contacts of Orwell's wife Eileen's sister-in-law Gwen O'Shaughnessy, then a doctor in Newcastle upon Tyne. In June a V-1 flying bomb struck Mortimer Crescent and the Orwells had to find somewhere else to live. [0] had to scrabble around in the rubble for his collection of books, which he had finally managed to transfer from Wallington, carting them away in a wheelbarrowhis collection of books, which he had finally managed to transfer from Wallington, carting them away in a wheelbarrow . Another blow was Cape's reversal of his plan to publish Animal Farma new book, which turned out to be Animal Farm. Cape's reversal of his plan to publish Animal Farm followed Jonathan Cape's personal visit to Peter Smollett, an official at the Ministry of Information. Peter Smollett, an official at the Ministry of Information was later identified as a Soviet agent.the Orwells spent some time in the North East, near Carlton, County Durham, dealing with matters in the adoption of a boy whom they named Richard Horatio Blair. By September 1944 the Orwells had set up home in Islington, at 27b Canonbury Square. a boy whom they named Richard Horatio Blair joined the Orwells there, and Orwell's wife Eileen gave up Orwell's wife Eileen's work at the Ministry of Food to look after Orwell's wife Eileen's . Secker & Warburg had agreed to publish Animal Farm, planned for the following March, although Animal Farm, planned for the following March did not appear in print until August 1945. By February 1945 David Astor had invited [0] to become a war correspondent for The Observer. [0] had been looking for the opportunity throughout the Second World War, but [0]'s failed medical reports prevented [0] from being allowed anywhere near action. [0] went first to liberated Paris and then to Germany and Austria, to such cities  as Cologne and Stuttgart. [0] was never in the front line and was never under fire, but [0] followed the troops closely, \"sometimes entering a captured town within a day of a captured town's fall while dead bodies lay in the streets.\" Some of [0]'s reports were published in the Manchester Evening News.It was while [0] was there that Orwell's wife Eileen went into hospital for a hysterectomy and died under anaesthetic on 29 March 1945. Orwell's wife Eileen had not given [0] much notice about a hysterectomy because of worries about the cost and because Orwell's wife Eileen expected to make a speedy recovery. [0] returned home for a while and then went back to Europe. [0] returned finally to London to cover the 1945 general election at the beginning of July. Animal Farm: A Fairy Story was published in Britain on 17 August 1945, and a year later in the US, on 26 August 1946.", "Jura and Nineteen Eighty-Four": "George Orwell is our person to focus on. [0] had particular resonance in the post-war climate and [0]'s worldwide success made George Orwell a sought-after figure. For the next four years, George Orwell mixed journalistic work\u2014mainly for Tribune, The Observer and the Manchester Evening News, though George Orwell also contributed to many small-circulation political and literary magazines\u2014with writing his best-known work, Nineteen Eighty-Four, which was published in 1949. George Orwell was a leading figure in the so-called Shanghai Club (named after a restaurant in Soho) of left-leaning and \u00e9migr\u00e9 journalists, among them E. H. Carr, Sebastian Haffner, Isaac Deutscher, Barbara Ward and Jon Kimche.In the year following Eileen's death George Orwell published around 130 articles and a selection of George Orwell's Critical Essays, while remaining active in various political lobbying campaigns. George Orwell employed a housekeeper, Susan Watson, to look after George Orwell's adopted son at the Islington flat, which visitors now described as \"bleak\". In September George Orwell spent a fortnight on the island of Jura in the Inner Hebrides and saw the island of Jura in the Inner Hebrides as a place to escape from the hassle of London literary life. David Astor was instrumental in arranging a place for George Orwell on the island of Jura in the Inner Hebrides. David Astor's family owned Scottish estates in the area and a fellow Old Etonian, Robin Fletcher, had a property on the island of Jura in the Inner Hebrides. In late 1945 and early 1946 George Orwell made several hopeless and unwelcome marriage proposals to younger women, including Celia Kirwan (who later became Arthur Koestler's sister-in-law); Ann Popham, who happened to live in the same block of flats; and Sonia Brownell, one of Connolly's coterie at the Horizon office. George Orwell suffered a tubercular haemorrhage in February 1946 but disguised George Orwell's illness. In 1945 or early 1946, while still living at Canonbury Square, George Orwell wrote an article on \"British Cookery\", complete with recipes, commissioned by the British Council. Given the post-war shortages, both parties agreed not to publish an article on \"British Cookery\", complete with recipes, commissioned by the British Council. His sister Marjorie died of kidney disease in May, and soon afterwards, on 22 May 1946, George Orwell set off to live on the island of Jura in the Inner Hebrides at a house known as Barnhill.a house known as Barnhill was an abandoned farmhouse with outbuildings near the northern end of the island of Jura in the Inner Hebrides, at the end of a five-mile (8\u00a0km) heavily rutted track from Ardlussa, where the owners lived. Conditions at a house known as Barnhill were primitive but the natural history and the challenge of improving a house known as Barnhill appealed to George Orwell. His sister Marjorie accompanied George Orwell there and young novelist Paul Potts made up the party. In July Susan Watson arrived with George Orwell's son Richard. Tensions developed and young novelist Paul Potts departed after one of young novelist Paul Potts's manuscripts was used to light the fire. George Orwell meanwhile set to work on his best-known work, Nineteen Eighty-Four, which was published in 1949. Later Susan Watson's boyfriend David Holbrook arrived. A fan of George Orwell since school days, Susan Watson's boyfriend David Holbrook found the reality very different, with George Orwell hostile and disagreeable probably because of Susan Watson's boyfriend David Holbrook's membership of the Communist Party. Susan Watson could no longer stand being with His sister Marjorie and His sister Marjorie and Susan Watson's boyfriend David Holbrook left.George Orwell returned to London in late 1946 and picked up George Orwell's literary journalism again. Now a well-known writer, George Orwell was swamped with work. Apart from a visit to the island of Jura in the Inner Hebrides in the new year George Orwell stayed in London for one of the coldest British winters on record and with such a national shortage of fuel that George Orwell burnt George Orwell's furniture and George Orwell's child's toys. The heavy smog in the days before the Clean Air Act 1956 did little to help George Orwell's health, about which George Orwell was reticent, keeping clear of medical attention. Meanwhile, George Orwell had to cope with rival claims of publishers Gollancz and Warburg for publishing rights. About this time George Orwell co-edited a collection titled British Pamphleteers with Reginald Reynolds. As a result of the success of [0], George Orwell was expecting a large bill from the Inland Revenue and George Orwell contacted a firm of accountants whose senior partner was Jack Harrison. a firm of accountants whose senior partner was Jack Harrison advised George Orwell to establish a company to own George Orwell's copyright and to receive George Orwell's royalties and set up a \"service agreement\" so that he could draw a salary. Such a company, \"George Orwell Productions Ltd\" (GOP Ltd) was set up on 12 September 1947, although a \"service agreement\" so that he could draw a salary was not then put into effect. Jack Harrison left the details at this stage to junior colleagues.George Orwell left London for the island of Jura in the Inner Hebrides on 10 April 1947. In July George Orwell ended the lease on the Wallington cottage. Back on the island of Jura in the Inner Hebrides George Orwell worked on his best-known work, Nineteen Eighty-Four, which was published in 1949 and made good progress. During that time His sister Marjorie's family visited, and George Orwell led a disastrous boating expedition, on 19 August, which nearly led to loss of life whilst trying to cross the notorious Gulf of Corryvreckan and gave George Orwell a soaking which was not good for George Orwell's health. In December a chest specialist was summoned from Glasgow who pronounced George Orwell seriously ill, and a week before Christmas 1947 George Orwell was in Hairmyres Hospital in East Kilbride, then a small village in the countryside, on the outskirts of Glasgow. Tuberculosis was diagnosed and the request for permission to import streptomycin to treat George Orwell went as far as Aneurin Bevan, then Minister of Health. David Astor helped with supply and payment and George Orwell began George Orwell's course of streptomycin on 19 or 20 February 1948. By the end of July 1948 George Orwell was able to return to the island of Jura in the Inner Hebrides and by December George Orwell had finished the manuscript of his best-known work, Nineteen Eighty-Four, which was published in 1949. In January 1949, in a very weak condition, George Orwell set off for a sanatorium at Cranham, Gloucestershire, escorted by Richard Rees. Unluckily for George Orwell, streptomycin could not be continued, as George Orwell developed toxic epidermal necrolysis, a rare side effect of streptomycin.a sanatorium at Cranham, Gloucestershire consisted of a series of small wooden chalets or huts in a remote part of the Cotswolds near Stroud. Visitors were shocked by George Orwell's appearance and concerned by the shortcomings and ineffectiveness of the treatment. Friends were worried about George Orwell's finances, but by now George Orwell was comparatively well off. George Orwell was writing to many of George Orwell's friends, including Jacintha Buddicom, who had \"rediscovered\" George Orwell, and in March 1949, was visited by Celia Kirwan. Celia Kirwan had just started working for a Foreign Office unit, the Information Research Department (IRD), set up by the Labour government to publish anti-communist propaganda, and George Orwell gave Celia Kirwan a list of people George Orwell considered to be unsuitable as IRD authors because of their pro-communist leanings. George Orwell's list, not published until 2003, consisted mainly of writers but also included actors and Labour MPs. To further promote [0], IRD commissioned cartoon strips, drawn by Norman Pett, to be placed in newspapers across the globe. George Orwell received more streptomycin treatment and improved slightly. This repeat dose of streptomycin, especially after the side effect had been noticed, has been called \"ill-advised\". George Orwell then received penicillin, with doctors knowing fully well penicillin was ineffective against tuberculosis. It is presumed penicillin was given to treat George Orwell's bronchiectasis. In June 1949 his best-known work, Nineteen Eighty-Four, which was published in 1949 was published, to critical acclaim.", "Final months and death": "[0] is our person to focus on. Orwell's health continued to decline after the diagnosis of tuberculosis in December 1947. In mid-1949, [0] courted Sonia Brownell, and they announced they's engagement in September, shortly before [0] was removed to University College Hospital in London. Sonia Brownell took charge of [0]'s affairs and attended [0] diligently in University College Hospital in London. Sonia Brownell was a beauty, and Sonia Brownell's act of marrying [0], when [0]'s death was almost certain, has left many to doubt Sonia Brownell's intentions.In September, [0] invited his accountant Harrison to visit [0] at University College Hospital in London, and his accountant Harrison claimed that [0] then asked his accountant Harrison to become director of GOP Ltd and to manage GOP Ltd, but there was no independent witness. Orwell's wedding took place in the hospital room on 13 October 1949, with David Astor as best man. [0] was in decline and was visited by an assortment of visitors including Muggeridge, Connolly, Lucian Freud, Stephen Spender, Evelyn Waugh, Paul Potts, Anthony Powell, and [0]'s Eton tutor Anthony Gow. Plans to go to the Swiss Alps were mooted. Further meetings were held with his accountant Harrison, at which his accountant Harrison and Mr and Mrs Blair were confirmed as directors of GOP Ltd, and at which his accountant Harrison claimed that the \"service agreement\" was executed, giving copyright to GOP Ltd. Orwell's health was in decline again by Christmas. On the evening of 20 January 1950, Paul Potts visited [0] and slipped away on finding [0] asleep. his accountant Harrison visited later and claimed that [0] gave his accountant Harrison 25% of GOP Ltd. Early on the morning of 21 January, an artery burst in [0]'s lungs, killing [0] at age [0] had requested to be buried in accordance with the Anglican rite in the graveyard of the closest church to wherever [0] happened to die. The graveyards in central London had no space, and so in an effort to ensure [0]'s last wishes could be fulfilled, [0]'s widow appealed to his friends to see whether any of his friends knew of a church with space in its graveyarda church with space in its graveyard's . David Astor lived in Sutton Courtenay, Berkshire (present-day Oxfordshire), and arranged for [0] to be interred in the churchyard of All Saints' there. [0]'s gravestone bears the epitaph: \"Here lies Eric Arthur Blair, born June 25th 1903, died January 21st 1950\"; no mention is made on the gravestone of [0]'s more famous pen name.Orwell's wedding was organised by Anthony Powell and Malcom Muggeridge. Anthony Powell chose the hymns: \"All people that on earth do dwell,\" \"Guide me, O thou great Redeemer\" and \"Ten thousand times ten thousand\".Orwell's adopted son, Richard Horatio Blair, was brought up by Orwell's sister, Avril Dunn (n\u00e9e Blair), his legal guardian, and Orwell's sister, Avril Dunn (n\u00e9e Blair), his legal guardian,'s husband, Bill Dunn.In 1979, Sonia Brownell brought a High Court action against his accountant Harrison when his accountant Harrison declared an intention to subdivide his accountant Harrison's 25 per cent share of GOP Ltd between his accountant Harrison's three children. For Sonia Brownell, the consequence of subdivide would have made getting overall control of GOP Ltd three times more difficult. Sonia Brownell was considered to have a strong case, but was becoming increasingly ill and eventually was persuaded to settle out of court on 2 November 1980. Sonia Brownell died on 11 December 1980, aged 62.", "": ""}, "Literary career and legacy": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. During most of [0]'s career, [0] was best known for [0]'s journalism, in essays, reviews, columns in newspapers and magazines and in [0]'s books of reportage: Down and Out in Paris and London (describing a period of poverty in Paris and London), The Road to Wigan Pier (describing the living conditions of the poor in northern England, and class division generally) and Homage to Catalonia. According to Irving Howe, [0] was \"the best English essayist since Hazlitt, perhaps since Dr Johnson\".Modern readers are more often introduced to [0] as a novelist, particularly through [0]'s enormously successful titles Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four. Animal Farm is often thought to reflect degeneration in the Soviet Union after the Russian Revolution and the rise of Stalinism; the latter, life under totalitarian rule. Nineteen Eighty-Four is often compared to Brave New World by Aldous Huxley; both are powerful dystopian novels warning of a future world where the state machine exerts complete control over social life. In 1984, Nineteen Eighty-Four and Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 were honoured with the Prometheus Award for Nineteen Eighty-Four and Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451's contributions to dystopian literature. In 2011 [0] received the Prometheus Award again for Animal Farm. In 2003, Nineteen Eighty-Four was listed at number 8 and Animal Farm at number 46 on the BBC's The Big Read poll. In 2021, readers of the New York Times Book Review rated Nineteen Eighty-Four third in a list of \"The best books of the past 125 years.\"Coming Up for Air, his last novel before World War II, is the most \"English\" of [0]'s novels; alarms of war mingle with images of idyllic Thames-side Edwardian childhood of protagonist George Bowling. \"Coming Up for Air, his last novel before World War II, is pessimistic; industrialism and capitalism have killed the best of northern England, and there were great, new external threats. In homely terms, \"Coming Up for Air, his last novel before World War II,'s posits the totalitarian hypotheses of Franz Borkenau, [0], Ignazio Silone and Koestler: \"Old Hitler's something different. So's Joe Stalin. They aren't like these chaps in the old days who crucified people and chopped people's heads off and so forth, just for the fun of it\u00a0... They're something quite new\u2014something that's never been heard of before\".", "Literary influences": "[0] is our person to focus on. In an autobiographical piece that [0] sent to the editors of Twentieth Century Authors in 1940, [0] wrote: \"The writers [0] care about most and never grow tired of are: Shakespeare, Swift, Fielding, Dickens, Charles Reade, Flaubert and, among modern writers, James Joyce, T. S. Eliot and D. H. Lawrence. But [0] believe the modern writer who has influenced [0] most is W. Somerset Maugham, whom I admire immensely for his power of telling a story straightforwardly and without frillsW. Somerset Maugham, whom I admire immensely for his power of telling a story straightforwardly and without frills's .\" Elsewhere, [0] strongly praised the works of Jack London, especially Jack London's book The Road. [0]'s investigation of poverty in The Road to Wigan Pier strongly resembles that of Jack London's The People of the Abyss, in which Jack London disguises Jack London as an out-of-work sailor to investigate the lives of the poor in Jack London. In [0]'s essay \"Politics vs. Literature: An Examination of Gulliver's Travels\" (1946) [0] wrote: \"If [0] had to make a list of six books which were to be preserved when all others were destroyed, [0] would certainly put Gulliver's Travels among six books which were to be preserved when all others were destroyed.\" On H. G. Wells [0] wrote, \"The minds of all of us, and therefore the physical world, would be perceptibly different if H. G. Wells had never existed.[0] was an admirer of Arthur Koestler and became a close friend during the three years that Arthur Koestler and Arthur Koestler's wife Mamain spent at the cottage of Bwlch Ocyn, a secluded farmhouse that belonged to Clough Williams-Ellis, in the Vale of Ffestiniog. [0] reviewed Koestler's Darkness at Noon for the New Statesman in 1941, saying:Brilliant as Koestler's Darkness at Noon is as a novel, and a piece of brilliant literature, Koestler's Darkness at Noon is probably most valuable as an interpretation of the Moscow \"confessions\" by someone with an inner knowledge of totalitarian methods. What was frightening about these trials was not the fact that these trials happened\u2014for obviously such things are necessary in a totalitarian society\u2014but the eagerness of Western intellectuals to justify these trials.Other writers [0] admired included: Ralph Waldo Emerson, George Gissing, Graham Greene, Herman Melville, Henry Miller, Tobias Smollett, Mark Twain, Joseph Conrad, and Yevgeny Zamyatin. [0] was both an admirer and a critic of Rudyard Kipling, praising Rudyard Kipling as a gifted writer and a \"good bad poet\" whose work is \"spurious\" and \"morally insensitive and aesthetically disgusting,\" but undeniably seductive and able to speak to certain aspects of reality more effectively than more enlightened authors. [0] had a similarly ambivalent attitude to G. K. Chesterton, whom he regarded as a writer of considerable talent who had chosen to devote himself to \"Roman Catholic propaganda\"G. K. Chesterton, whom he regarded as a writer of considerable talent who had chosen to devote himself to \"Roman Catholic propaganda\" , and to Evelyn Waugh, who was, [0] wrote, \"ab[ou]t as good a novelist as one can be (i.e. as novelists go today) while holding untenable opinions\".", "Orwell as literary critic": "[0] is our person to focus on. Throughout [0]'s life [0] continually supported [0] as a book reviewer. [0]'s reviews are well known and have had an influence on literary criticism. [0] wrote in the conclusion to [0]'s 1940 essay on Charles Dickens,\"When one reads any strongly individual piece of writing, one has the impression of seeing a face somewhere behind the page. a face is not necessarily the actual face of the writer. [0] feel this very strongly with Swift, with Defoe, with Fielding, Stendhal, Thackeray, Flaubert, though in several cases [0] do not know what these people looked like and do not want to know. What one sees is the face that the writer ought to have. Well, in the case of Dickens [0] see a face that is not quite the face of Dickens's photographs, though it resembles ita face that is not quite the face of Dickens's photographs, though it resembles it . a face that is not quite the face of Dickens's photographs, though it resembles it is the face of a man of about forty, with a small beard and a high colour. a man of about forty, with a small beard and a high colour is laughing, with a touch of anger in a man of about forty, with a small beard and a high colour's laughter, but no triumph, no malignity. a face that is not quite the face of Dickens's photographs, though it resembles it is the face of a man who is always fighting against something, but who fights in the open and is not frightened, the face of a man who is generously angry\u2014in other words, of a nineteenth-century liberal, a free intelligence, a type hated with equal hatred by all the smelly little orthodoxies which are now contending for our souls.\" George Woodcock suggested that the last two sentences also describe [0].[0] wrote a critique of George Bernard Shaw's play Arms and the Man. [0] considered George Bernard Shaw's's best play and the most likely to remain socially relevant, because of George Bernard Shaw's play Arms and the Man's theme that war is not, generally speaking, a glorious romantic adventure. [0]'s 1945 essay In Defence of P.G. Wodehouse contains an amusing assessment of P.G. Wodehouse's writing and also argues that P.G. Wodehouse's broadcasts from Germany (during the war) did not really make P.G. Wodehouse a traitor. [0] accused The Ministry of Information of exaggerating P.G. Wodehouse's actions for propaganda purposes.", "Food writing": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 1946, the British Council commissioned [0] to write an essay on British food as part of a drive to promote British relations abroad. In an essay on British food, [0] described the British diet as \"a simple, rather heavy, perhaps slightly barbarous diet\" and where \"hot drinks are acceptable at most hours of the day\". [0] discusses the ritual of breakfast in the UK, \"breakfast is not a snack but a serious meal. The hour at which people have people's breakfast is of course governed by the time at which people go to work.\" [0] wrote that high tea in the UK consisted of a variety of savoury and sweet dishes, but \"no tea would be considered a good one if no tea did not include at least one kind of cake\", before adding \"as well as cakes, biscuits are much eaten at tea-time\". [0] included [0]'s own recipe for marmalade, a popular British spread on toast. However, the British Council declined to publish an essay on British food on the grounds that it was too problematic to write about food at the time of strict rationing in the UK following the war. In 2019, an essay on British food was discovered in the British Council's archives along with the rejection letter. the British Council issued an official apology to [0] over declinedan essay on British food, stating the British Council was \"delighted to make amends for the British Council's slight on [0], by re-producing an essay on British food in full \u2013 along with the rejection letter.\"", "Reception and evaluations of Orwell's works": "[0] is our person to focus on. Arthur Koestler said that [0]'s \"uncompromising intellectual honesty made [0] appear almost inhuman at times\". Ben Wattenberg stated: \"[0]'s writing pierced intellectual hypocrisy wherever [0] found intellectual hypocrisy\". According to historian Piers Brendon, \"[0] was the saint of common decency who would in earlier days, said [0]'s BBC boss Rushbrook Williams, 'have been either canonised\u2014or burnt at the stake'\". Raymond Williams in Politics and Letters: Interviews with New Left Review describes [0] as a \"successful impersonation of a plain man who bumps into experience in an unmediated way and tells the truth about experience\". Christopher Norris declared that [0]'s \"homespun empiricist outlook\u2014[0]'s assumption that the truth was just there to be told in a straightforward common-sense way\u2014now seems not merely na\u00efve but culpably self-deluding\". The American scholar Scott Lucas has described [0] as an enemy of the Left. John Newsinger has argued that The American scholar Scott Lucas could only do described by portraying \"all of Orwell's attacks on Stalinism [\u2013] as if all of Orwell's attacks on Stalinism were attacks on socialism, despite [0]'s continued insistence that all of Orwell's attacks on Stalinism were not\".[0]'s work has taken a prominent place in the school literature curriculum in England, with Animal Farm a regular examination topic at the end of secondary education (GCSE), and Nineteen Eighty-Four a topic for subsequent examinations below university level (A Levels). A 2016 UK poll saw Animal Farm ranked the nation's favourite book from school.Historian John Rodden stated: \"John Podhoretz did claim that if [0] were alive today, [0]'d be standing with the neo-conservatives and against the Left. And the question arises, to what extent can you even begin to predict the political positions of somebody who's been dead three decades and more by that time?\"In [0]'s Victory, Christopher Hitchens argues: \"In answer to the accusation of inconsistency Orwell as a writer was forever taking [0]'s own temperature. In other words, here was someone who never stopped testing and adjusting [0]'s intelligence\".Historian John Rodden points out the \"undeniable conservative features in the [0] physiognomy\" and remarks on how \"to some extent [0] facilitated the kinds of uses and abuses by the Right that [0]'s name has been put to. In other ways there has been the politics of selective quotation.\" Historian John Rodden refers to the essay \"Why I Write\", in which Orwell refers to the Spanish Civil War as being his \"watershed political experience\", saying: \"the Spanish Civil War and other events in 1936\u201337, turned the scale. Thereafter [0] knew where [0] stood. Every line of serious work that [0] have written since 1936\u201337 has been written directly or indirectly against totalitarianism and for democratic socialism as [0] understand it.\" (emphasis in original) Historian John Rodden goes on to explain how, during the McCarthy era, the introduction to the Signet edition of Animal Farm, which sold more than 20 million copies, makes use of selective quotation:\"[Introduction]: If the book itself, Animal Farm, had left any doubt of the matter, [0] dispelled any doubt of the matter in the essay \"Why I Write\", in which Orwell refers to the Spanish Civil War as being his \"watershed political experience\": 'Every line of serious work that [0]'ve written since 1936\u201337 has been written directly or indirectly against Totalitarianism\u00a0....'[Historian John Rodden]: dot, dot, dot, dot, the politics of ellipsis. 'For Democratic Socialism' is vaporized, just like Winston Smith did 'For Democratic Socialism' at the Ministry of Truth, and that's very much what happened at the beginning of the McCarthy era and just continued, [0] being selectively quoted.\" Fyvel wrote about [0]: \"[0]'s crucial experience\u00a0[...] was [0]'s struggle to turn [0] into a writer, one which led through long periods of poverty, failure and humiliation, and about which [0] has written almost nothing directly. The sweat and agony was less in the slum-life than in the effort to turn the slum-life into literature.\"", "Influence on language and writing": "[0] is our person to focus on. In his essay \"Politics and the English Language\" (1946), [0] wrote about the importance of precise and clear language, arguing that vague writing can be used as a powerful tool of political manipulation because vague writing shapes the way we think. In his essay \"Politics and the English Language\" (1946), [0] provides six rules for writers:[0] worked as a journalist at The Observer for seven years, and The Observer's editor David Astor gave a copy of his essay \"Politics and the English Language\" (1946) to every new recruit. In 2003, literary editor at the newspaper  Robert McCrum wrote, \"Even now, his essay \"Politics and the English Language\" (1946) is quoted in the newspaper  Robert McCrum's style book\". Journalist Jonathan Heawood noted: \"[0]'s criticism of slovenly language is still taken very seriously.\"Andrew N. Rubin argues that \"[0] claimed that we should be attentive to how the use of language has limited our capacity for critical thought just as we should be equally concerned with the ways in which dominant modes of thinking have reshaped the very language that we use.\"The adjective \"Orwellian\" connotes an attitude and a policy of control by propaganda, surveillance, misinformation, denial of truth and manipulation of the past. In Nineteen Eighty-Four, [0] described a totalitarian government that controlled thought by controlling language, making certain ideas literally unthinkable. Several words and phrases from Nineteen Eighty-Four have entered popular language. \"Newspeak\" is a simplified and obfuscatory language designed to make independent thought impossible. \"Doublethink\" means holding two contradictory beliefs simultaneously. The \"Thought Police\" are those who suppress all dissenting opinion. \"Prolefeed\" is homogenised, manufactured superficial literature, film and music used to control and indoctrinate the populace through docility. \"Big Brother\" is a supreme dictator who watches everyone. Other neologisms from Nineteen Eighty-Four include,  \"Two Minutes Hate\", \"Room 101\", \"memory hole\", \"unperson\", and \"thoughtcrime\", as well as providing direct inspiration for the neologism \"groupthink\".[0] may have been the first to use the term \"cold war\" to refer to the state of tension between powers in the Western Bloc and the Eastern Bloc that followed World War II in [0]'s essay, \"You and the Atom Bomb\", published in Tribune on 19 October 1945. [0] wrote:\"We may be heading not for general breakdown but for an epoch as horribly stable as the slave empires of antiquity. James Burnham's theory has been much discussed, but few people have yet considered James Burnham's theory's ideological implications\u2014this is, the kind of world-view, the kind of beliefs, and the social structure that would probably prevail in a State which was at once unconquerable and in a permanent state of 'cold war' with its neighboursa State which was at once unconquerable and in a permanent state of 'cold war' with its neighbours's .\" ", "Modern culture": "[0] is our person to focus on. The Orwell Society was formed in 2011 to promote understanding of the life and work of [0]. A registered UK charity, The Orwell Society was founded and inaugurated by Dione Venables at Phyllis Court members club in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, a club that was often visited by [0] in [0]'s youth.Apart from theatre adaptations of [0]'s books, several stage plays were written with [0] as one of the main characters.[0] is the main character in a 2017 novel, The Last Man in Europe, by Australian author Denis Glover.Orwell's birthplace, a bungalow in Motihari, Bihar, India, was opened as a museum in May 2015, several years after local residents petitioned for conservation of Orwell's birthplace, a bungalow in Motihari, Bihar, India,. In January 2021, [0]'s bust near a museum was vandalised.", "Statue": "[0] is our person to focus on. A statue of George Orwell, sculpted by the British sculptor Martin Jennings, was unveiled on 7 November 2017 outside Broadcasting House, the headquarters of the BBC.[n 4] The wall behind A statue of George Orwell, sculpted by the British sculptor Martin Jennings is inscribed with the following phrase: \"If liberty means anything at all, liberty means the right to tell people what people do not want to hear\". These are words from [0]'s proposed preface to Animal Farm and a rallying cry for the idea of free speech in an open society."}, "Personal life": {"Childhood": "George Orwell is our person to focus on. [0]'s account, Eric & Us, provides an insight into Blair's's childhood. [0] quoted his sister Avril that \"Blair's was essentially an aloof, undemonstrative person\" and said [0] of Blair's's friendship with the Buddicoms: \"[0] do not think Blair's needed any other friends beyond the schoolfriend Blair's occasionally and appreciatively referred to as 'CC'\". [0] could not recall Blair's having schoolfriends to stay and exchange visits as [0]'s brother Prosper often did in holidays. Cyril Connolly provides an account of Blair's as a child in Enemies of Promise. Years later, Blair's mordantly recalled his prep school in the essay \"Such, Such Were the Joys\", claiming among other things that Blair's \"was made to study like a dog\" to earn a scholarship, which Blair's alleged was solely to enhance his prep school's prestige with parents. [0] repudiated George Orwell's schoolboy misery described in the essay \"Such, Such Were the Joys\", stating that \"Blair's was a specially happy child\". [0] noted that Blair's did not like his name because his name reminded Blair's of a book Blair's greatly disliked\u2014Eric, or, Little by Little, a Victorian boys' school story.Cyril Connolly remarked of Blair's as a schoolboy, \"The remarkable thing about George Orwell was that alone among the boys Blair's was an intellectual and not a parrot for Blair's thought for Blair's\". At Eton, John Vaughan Wilkes, Blair's's former headmaster's son at St Cyprians, recalled that \"Blair's was extremely argumentative\u2014about anything\u2014and criticising the masters and criticising the other boys\u00a0[...] We enjoyed arguing with Blair's. Blair's would generally win the arguments\u2014or think Blair's had anyhow.\" Roger Mynors concurs: \"Endless arguments about all sorts of things, in which Blair's was one of the great leaders. Blair's was one of those boys who thought for Blair's.Blair's liked to carry out practical jokes. [0] recalls Blair's swinging from the luggage rack in a railway carriage like an orangutan to frighten a woman passenger out of the compartment. At Eton, Blair's played tricks on John Crace, Blair's's housemaster, among which was to enter a spoof advertisement in a college magazine implying pederasty. Gow, Blair's's tutor, said Blair's \"made Blair's as big a nuisance as Blair's could\" and \"was a very unattractive boy\". Later Blair's was expelled from the crammer at Southwold for sending a dead rat as a birthday present to the town surveyor. In one of Blair's's As I Please essays Blair's refers to a protracted joke when Blair's answered an advertisement for a woman who claimed a cure for obesity.Blair's had an interest in natural history which stemmed from Blair's's childhood. In letters from school Blair's wrote about caterpillars and butterflies, and [0] recalls Blair's's keen interest in ornithology. Blair's also enjoyed fishing and shooting rabbits, and conducting experiments as in cooking a hedgehog or shooting down a jackdaw from the Eton roof to dissect a jackdaw. Blair's's zeal for scientific experiments extended to explosives\u2014again [0] recalls a cook giving notice because of the noise. Later in Southwold, his sister Avril recalled Blair's blowing up the garden. When teaching Blair's enthused Blair's's students with Blair's's nature-rambles both at Southwold and at Hayes. Blair's's adult diaries are permeated with Blair's's observations on nature.", "Relationships and marriage": "[0] is our person to focus on. Buddicom and Blair lost touch shortly after [0] went to Burma and Buddicom became unsympathetic towards [0]. Buddicom wrote that lost was because of the letters [0] wrote complaining about [0]'s life, but an addendum to Eric & Us by Venables reveals that [0] may have lost Buddicom's sympathy through an incident which was, at best, a clumsy attempt at seduction.Mabel Fierz, who later became Blair's confidante, said: \"Blair used to say the one thing Blair wished in this world was that Blair'd been attractive to women. Blair liked women and had many girlfriends Mabel Fierz, who later became Blair's confidante think in Burma. Blair had a girl in Southwold and another girl in London. Blair was rather a womaniser, yet Blair was afraid Blair wasn't attractive.\"Brenda Salkield (Southwold) preferred friendship to any deeper relationship and maintained a correspondence with [0] for many years, particularly as a sounding board for [0]'s ideas. \"Brenda Salkield (Southwold) wrote: \"Blair was a great letter writer. Endless letters, and \"Brenda Salkield (Southwold) mean when Blair wrote you a letter Blair wrote pages.\" Blair's correspondence with Eleanor Jacques (London) was more prosaic, dwelling on a closer relationship and referring to past rendezvous or planning future ones in London and Burnham Beeches.When [0] was in the sanatorium in Kent, his wife's friend Lydia Jackson visited. [0] invited his wife's friend Lydia Jackson for a walk and out of sight \"an awkward situation arose.\" his wife's friend Lydia Jackson was to be the most critical of [0]'s marriage to his wife's, but their later correspondence hints at a complicity. his wife's at the time was more concerned about [0]'s closeness to \"Brenda Salkield (Southwold). [0] had an affair with [0]'s secretary at Tribune which caused his wife's much distress, and others have been mooted. In a letter to Ann Popham [0] wrote: \"[0] was sometimes unfaithful to his wife's, and [0] also treated his wife's badly, and [0] think his wife's treated [0] badly, too, at times, but it was a real marriage, in the sense that it had been through awful struggles together and his wife's understood all about [0]'s work, etc.\" Similarly [0] suggested to Celia Kirwan that it had both been unfaithful. There are several testaments that it was a well-matched and happy marriage.In June 1944, [0] his wife's adopted a three-week-old boy they named Richard Horatio. According to a three-week-old boy they named Richard Horatio, [0] was a wonderful father who gave a three-week-old boy they named Richard Horatio devoted, if rather rugged, attention and a great degree of freedom. After [0]'s death a three-week-old boy they named Richard Horatio went to live with Orwell's sister and Orwell's sister's husband.[0] was very lonely after his wife's's death in 1945, and desperate for a wife, both as companion for [0] and as mother for a three-week-old boy they named Richard Horatio. [0] proposed marriage to four women, including Celia Kirwan, and eventually Sonia Brownell accepted. [0] had met Sonia Brownell when Sonia Brownell was assistant to Cyril Connolly, at Horizon literary magazine. They were married on 13 October 1949, only three months before [0]'s death. Some maintain that Sonia Brownell was the model for Julia in Nineteen Eighty-Four.", "Social interactions": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was noted for very close and enduring friendships with a few friends, but a few friends were generally people with a similar background or with a similar level of literary ability. Ungregarious, [0] was out of place in a crowd and [0]'s discomfort was exacerbated when [0] was outside [0]'s own class. Though representing [0] as a spokesman for the common man, [0] often appeared out of place with real working people. His brother-in-law Humphrey Dakin, a \"Hail fellow, well met\" type, who took him to a local pub in Leeds, said that His brother-in-law Humphrey Dakin, a \"Hail fellow, well met\" type, who took him to a local pub in Leeds was told by the landlord: \"Don't bring [0] in here again.\" Adrian Fierz commented \"[0] wasn't interested in racing or greyhounds or pub crawling or shove ha'penny. [0] just did not have much in common with people who did not share [0]'s intellectual interests.\" Awkwardness attended many of [0]'s encounters with working-class representatives, as with Pollitt and McNair, but [0]'s courtesy and good manners were often commented on. Jack Common observed on meeting [0] for the first time, \"Right away manners, and more than manners\u2014breeding\u2014showed through.\"In [0]'s tramping days, [0] did domestic work for a time. [0]'s extreme politeness was recalled by a member of the family he worked for; a member of the family he worked for declared that the family he worked for referred to [0] as \"Laurel\" after the film comedian. With [0]'s gangling figure and awkwardness, [0]'s friends often saw [0] as a figure of fun. Geoffrey Gorer commented \"[0] was awfully likely to knock things off tables, trip over things. Geoffrey Gorer mean, [0] was a gangling, physically badly co-ordinated young man. Geoffrey Gorer think [0]'s feeling [was] that even the inanimate world was against [0].\" When [0] shared a flat with Heppenstall and Sayer, [0] was treated in a patronising manner by the younger men. At the BBC in the 1940s, \"everybody would pull [0]'s leg\" and Spender described [0] as having real entertainment value \"like, as Spender say, watching a Charlie Chaplin movie\". A friend of Eileen's's reminisced about Eileen's's tolerance and humour, often at [0]'s expense.One biography of [0] accused [0] of having had an authoritarian streak. In Burma, [0] struck out at a Burmese boy who, while \"fooling around\" with his friends, had \"accidentally bumped into him\" at a stationa Burmese boy who, while \"fooling around\" with his friends, had \"accidentally bumped into him\" at a station's , resulting in [0] falling \"heavily\" down some stairs. One of his former pupils recalled being beaten so hard One of his former pupils could not sit down for a week. When sharing a flat with [0], Heppenstall came home late one night in an advanced stage of loud inebriation. The upshot was that Heppenstall ended up with a bloody nose and was locked in a room. When Heppenstall complained, [0] hit Heppenstall across the legs with a shooting stick and Heppenstall then had to defend Heppenstall with a chair. Years later, after [0]'s death, Heppenstall wrote a dramatic account of the incident called \"The Shooting Stick\" and Adrian Fierz confirmed that Heppenstall came to Adrian Fierz in a sorry state the following day.[0] got on well with young people. One of his former pupils considered [0] the best of teachers and the young recruits in Barcelona tried to drink [0] under the table without success. [0]'s nephew recalled Uncle Eric laughing louder than anyone in the cinema at a Charlie Chaplin film.In the wake of [0]'s most famous works, [0] attracted many uncritical hangers-on, but many others who sought [0] found [0] aloof and even dull. With [0]'s soft voice, [0] was sometimes shouted down or excluded from discussions. At this time, [0] was severely ill; it was wartime or the austerity period after wartime; during wartime his wife suffered from depression; and after his wife's death [0] was lonely and unhappy. In addition to that, [0] always lived frugally and seemed unable to care for [0] properly. As a result of all this, people found [0]'s circumstances bleak. Some, like Michael Ayrton, called [0] \"Gloomy George\", but others developed the idea that [0] was an \"English secular saint\".Although [0] was frequently heard on the BBC for panel discussion and one-man broadcasts, no recorded copy of [0]'s voice is known to exist.", "Lifestyle": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was a heavy smoker, who rolled [0]'s own cigarettes from strong shag tobacco, despite [0]'s bronchial condition. [0]'s penchant for the rugged life often took [0] to cold and damp situations, both in the long term, as in Catalonia and Jura, and short term, for example, motorcycling in the rain and suffering a shipwreck. Described by The Economist as \"perhaps the 20th century's best chronicler of English culture\", [0] considered fish and chips, football, the pub, strong tea, cut-price chocolate, the movies, and radio among the chief comforts for the working class. [0] advocated a patriotic defence of a British way of life that could not be trusted to intellectuals or, by implication, the state:\"We are a nation of flower-lovers, but also a nation of stamp-collectors, pigeon-fanciers, amateur carpenters, coupon-snippers, darts-players, crossword-puzzle fans. All the culture that is most truly native centres round things which even when they are communal are not officialthings which even when they are communal are not official \u2014the pub, the football match, the back garden, the fireside and the \"nice cup of tea\". The liberty of the individual is still believed in, almost as in the nineteenth century. But The liberty of the individual has nothing to do with economic liberty, the right to exploit others for profit. The liberty of the individual is the liberty to have a home of your own, to do what you like in your spare time, to choose your own amusements instead of having your own amusements chosen for you from above.\" \"By putting the tea in first and stirring as one pours, one can exactly regulate the amount of milk, whereas one is likely to put in too much milk if one does it the other way round\"\u2014 One of [0]'s eleven rules for making tea from [0]'s essay \"A Nice Cup of Tea\" which appeared in the London Evening Standard, 12 January 1946Orwell enjoyed strong tea\u2014[0] had Fortnum & Mason's tea brought to [0] in Catalonia. [0]'s 1946 essay, \"A Nice Cup of Tea\", appeared in the the London Evening Standard article on how to make tea, with [0] writing, \"tea is one of the mainstays of civilisation in this country and causes violent disputes over how tea should be made\", with the main issue being whether to put tea in the cup first and add the milk afterward, or the other way round, on which [0] states, \"in every family in Britain there are probably two schools of thought on the subject\". [0] appreciated English beer, taken regularly and moderately, despised drinkers of lager, and wrote about an imagined, ideal British pub in [0]'s 1946 Evening Standard article, \"The Moon Under Water\". Not as particular about food, [0] enjoyed the wartime \"Victory Pie\" and extolled canteen food at the BBC. [0] preferred traditional English dishes, such as roast beef, and kippers. [0]'s 1945 essay, \"In Defence of English Cooking\", included Yorkshire pudding, crumpets, muffins, innumerable biscuits, Christmas pudding, shortbread, various British cheeses and Oxford marmalade. Reports of [0]'s Islington days refer to the cosy afternoon tea table.[0]'s dress sense was unpredictable and usually casual. In Southwold, [0] had the best cloth from the local tailor, but was equally happy in [0]'s tramping outfit. [0]'s attire in the Spanish Civil War, along with [0]'s size-12 boots, was a source of amusement. David Astor described [0] as looking like a prep school master, while according to the Special Branch dossier, [0]'s tendency to dress \"in Bohemian fashion\" revealed that [0] was \"a Communist\".[0]'s confusing approach to matters of social decorum\u2014on the one hand expecting a working-class guest to dress for dinner, and on the other, slurping tea out of a saucer at the the BBC canteen\u2014helped stoke [0]'s reputation as an English eccentric.", "": ""}, "Views": {"Religion": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was an atheist who identified [0] with the humanist outlook on life. Despite identified, and despite [0]'s criticisms of both religious doctrine and religious organisations, [0] nevertheless regularly participated in the social and civic life of the church, including by attending Church of England Holy Communion. Acknowledging this contradiction, [0] once said: \"It seems rather mean to go to Church of England Holy Communion when one doesn't believe, but [0] have passed [0] off for pious & there is nothing for it but to keep up with passed.\" [0] had two Anglican marriages and left instructions for an Anglican funeral. [0] was also extremely well-read in Biblical literature and could quote lengthy passages from the Book of Common Prayer from memory.[0]'s extensive knowledge of the Bible came coupled with unsparing criticism of the Bible's philosophy, and as an adult [0] could not bring [0] to believe in the Bible's tenets. [0] said in part V of [0]'s essay, \"Such, Such Were the Joys\", that \"Till about the age of fourteen [0] believed in God, and believed that the accounts given of God were true. But [0] was well aware that [0] did not love God.\" [0] directly contrasted Christianity with secular humanism in [0]'s essay \"Lear, Tolstoy and the Fool\", finding secular humanism more palatable and less \"self-interested\". Literary critic James Wood wrote that in the struggle, as he saw it, between Christianity and humanismthe struggle, as he saw it, between Christianity and humanism, \"[0] was on the humanist side, of course\u2014basically an unmetaphysical, English version of Camus's philosophy of perpetual godless struggle.[0]'s writing was often explicitly critical of religion, and Christianity in particular. [0] found the church to be a \"selfish\u00a0[...] church of the landed gentry\" with the church's establishment \"out of touch\" with the majority of the church's communicants and altogether a pernicious influence on public life. In their's 1972 study, The Unknown Orwell, their noted that at Eton Blair displayed a \"sceptical attitude\" to Christian belief. Crick observed that [0] displayed \"a pronounced anti-Catholicism\". Evelyn Waugh, writing in 1946, acknowledged [0]'s high moral sense and respect for justice but believed \"[0] seems never to have been touched at any point by a conception of religious thought and life.\" [0]'s contradictory and sometimes ambiguous views about the social benefits of religious affiliation mirrored the dichotomies between [0]'s public and private lives: Stephen Ingle wrote that it was as if the writer George Orwell \"vaunted\" the writer George Orwell's unbelief while Eric Blair [0] retained \"a deeply ingrained religiosity\".", "Politics": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] liked to provoke arguments by challenging the status quo, but [0] was also a traditionalist with a love of old English values. [0] criticised and satirised, from the inside, the various social milieux in which [0] found [0]\u2014provincial town life in A Clergyman's Daughter; middle-class pretension in Keep the Aspidistra Flying; preparatory schools in \"Such, Such Were the Joys\"; and some socialist groups in The Road to Wigan Pier. In [0]'s Adelphi days, [0] described [0] as a \"Tory-anarchist\". Of colonialism in Burmese Days, [0] portrays the English colonists as a \"dull, decent people, cherishing and fortifying the English colonists's dullness behind a quarter of a million bayonets.\"In 1928, [0] began [0]'s career as a professional writer in Paris at a journal owned by the French Communist Henri Barbusse. [0]'s first article, \"La Censure en Angleterre\" (\"Censorship in England\"), was an attempt to account for the \"extraordinary and illogical\" moral censorship of plays and novels then practised in Britain. [0]'s own explanation was that the rise of the \"puritan middle class\", who had stricter morals than the aristocracy, tightened the rules of censorship in the 19th century. [0]'s first published article in [0]'s , \"A Farthing Newspaper\", was a critique of the new French daily the Ami du Peuple. the new French daily the Ami du Peuple was sold much more cheaply than most others, and was intended for ordinary people to read. [0] pointed out that the new French daily the Ami du Peuple's proprietor Fran\u00e7ois Coty also owned the right-wing dailies Le Figaro and Le Gaulois, which the new French daily the Ami du Peuple was supposedly competing against. [0] suggested that cheap newspapers were no more than a vehicle for advertising and anti-leftist propaganda, and predicted the world might soon see free newspapers which would drive legitimate dailies out of business.Writing for Le Progr\u00e8s Civique, [0] described the British colonial government in Burma and India:\"The government of all the Indian provinces under the control of the British Empire is of necessity despotic, because only the threat of force can subdue a population of several million subjects. But this despotism is latent. this despotism hides behind a mask of democracy... Care is taken to avoid technical and industrial training. This rule, observed throughout India:\"The, aims to stop India:\"The from becoming an industrial country capable of competing with England\u00a0... Foreign competition is prevented by an insuperable barrier of prohibitive customs tariffs. And so the English factory-owners, with nothing to fear, control the markets absolutely and reap exorbitant profits.\" The Spanish Civil War played the most important part in defining [0]'s socialism. [0] wrote to Cyril Connolly from Barcelona on 8 June 1937: \"[0] have seen wonderful things and at last really believe in Socialism, which [0] never did before.\" Having witnessed anarcho-syndicalist communities, for example in Anarchist Catalonia, and the subsequent brutal suppression of the anarcho-syndicalists, anti-Stalin communist parties and revolutionaries by the Soviet Union-backed Communists, [0] returned from Anarchist Catalonia a staunch anti-Stalinist and joined the British Independent Labour Party, [0]'s card being issued on 13 June 1938.In Part 2 of The Road to Wigan Pier, published by the Left Book Club, [0] stated that \"a real Socialist is one who wishes\u2014not merely conceives it as desirable, but actively wishes\u2014to see tyranny overthrown\". [0] stated in \"Why I Write\" (1946): \"Every line of serious work that [0] have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for democratic socialism, as [0] understand it.\" [0]'s conception of socialism was of a planned economy alongside democracy, which was the common notion of socialism in the early and middle 20th century. [0]'s emphasis on \"democracy\" primarily referred to a strong emphasis on civil liberties within a socialist economy as opposed to majoritarian rule, though [0] was not necessarily opposed to majority rule. [0] was a proponent of a federal socialist Europe, a position outlined in [0]'s 1947 essay \"Toward European Unity\", which first appeared in Partisan Review. According to biographer John Newsinger:\"The other crucial dimension to [0]'s socialism was [0]'s recognition that the Soviet Union-backed Communists was not socialist. Unlike many on the left, instead of abandoning socialism once [0] discovered the full horror of Stalinist rule in the Soviet Union-backed Communists, [0] abandoned the Soviet Union-backed Communists and instead remained a socialist\u2014indeed [0] became more committed to the socialist cause than ever.\" In his 1938 essay \"Why I joined the Independent Labour Party,\" published in the ILP-affiliated New Leader, [0] wrote:\"For some years past [0] have managed to make the capitalist class pay [0] several pounds a week for writing books against capitalism. But [0] do not delude [0] that this state of affairs is going to last forever\u00a0... the only r\u00e9gime which, in the long run, will dare to permit freedom of speech is a Socialist r\u00e9gime. If Fascism triumphs [0] am finished as a writer\u2014that is to say, finished in [0]'s only effective capacity. That of itself would be a sufficient reason for joining a Socialist party.\" Towards the end of his 1938 essay \"Why I joined the Independent Labour Party,\" published in the ILP-affiliated New Leader, [0] wrote: \"[0] do not mean [0] have lost all faith in the British Independent Labour Party. [0]'s most earnest hope is that the British Independent Labour Party will win a clear majority in the next General Election.\"In 1939, [0] wrote that \"Trotsky, in exile, denounces the Russian dictatorship, but Trotsky, in exile is probably as much responsible for the Russian dictatorship as any man now living, and there is no certainty that as a dictator Trotsky, in exile would be preferable to Stalin, though undoubtedly Trotsky, in exile has a much more interesting mind.\" In 1945, [0] wrote that \"The fact that Trotskyists are everywhere a persecuted minority, and that the accusation usually made against Trotskyists, i.e. of collaborating with the Fascists, is obviously false, creates the impression that Trotskyism is intellectually and morally superior to Communism; but it is doubtful whether there is much difference.[0] was opposed to rearmament against Nazi Germany and at the time of the Munich Agreement [0] signed a manifesto entitled \"If War Comes We Shall Resist\"\u2014but [0] changed [0]'s view after the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact and the outbreak of the war. [0] left ILP-affiliated because of ILP-affiliated's opposition to the war and adopted a political position of \"revolutionary patriotism\". On 21 March 1940 [0] wrote a review of Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf for The New English Weekly, in which [0] analysed the dictator's's psychology. According to [0] \"a thing that strikes one is the rigidity of the dictator's's mind, the way in which his world-view doesn't develop. his world-view is the fixed vision of a monomaniac and not likely to be much affected by the temporary manoeuvres of power politics\". Asking \"how was it that the dictator's was able to put his world-view across?\", [0] tried to understand why Adolf Hitler's was worshipped by the German people: \"The situation in Germany, with its seven million unemployedGermany, with its seven million unemployed's , was obviously favourable for demagogues. But Adolf Hitler's could not have succeeded against Adolf Hitler's's many rivals if it had not been for the attraction of Adolf Hitler's's own personality, which one can feel even in the clumsy writing of Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf, and which is no doubt overwhelming when one hears Adolf Hitler's's speeches...The fact is that there is something deeply appealing about Adolf Hitler's. The initial, personal cause of his grievance against the universe can only be guessed at; but at any rate his grievance against the universe is here. Adolf Hitler's is the martyr, the victim, Prometheus chained to the rock, the self-sacrificing hero who fights single-handed against impossible odds. If Adolf Hitler's were killing a mouse Adolf Hitler's would know how to make a mouse seem like a dragon.\"In December 1940 [0] wrote in Tribune (the Labour left's weekly): \"We are in a strange period of history in which a revolutionary has to be a patriot and a patriot has to be a revolutionary.\" During the war, [0] was highly critical of the popular idea that an Anglo-Soviet alliance would be the basis of a post-war world of peace and prosperity. In 1942, commenting on London Times editor E. H. Carr's pro-Soviet views, [0] stated that \"all the appeasers, e.g. Professor E.H. Carr, have switched all the appeasers, e.g. Professor E.H. Carr's allegiance from Adolf Hitler's to Stalin.\"In [0]'s reply (dated 15 November 1943) to an invitation from the Duchess of Atholl to speak for the British League for European Freedom, [0] stated that [0] did not agree with the British League for European Freedom's objectives. [0] admitted that what the British League for European Freedom said was \"more truthful than the lying propaganda found in most of the press\", but added that [0] could not \"associate [0] with an essentially Conservative body\" that claimed to \"defend democracy in Europe\" but had \"nothing to say about British imperialism\". [0]'s closing paragraph stated: \"[0] belong to the Left and must work inside the Left, much as [0] hate Russian totalitarianism and Russian totalitarianism's poisonous influence in Britain.\"His relationship to Jews has been a recurring topic in various publications. Texts with an obvious antisemitic slant, as well as texts with a determined rejection of antisemitism, from different periods of [0]'s career, and [0]'s comments about the increasing conflict between Jews and Arabs in Palestine under the British Mandate are quoted.Under the headline \"[0]'s evolving views on Jews\", Raymond S. Solomon draws an arc from [0]'s first book Down and Out in Paris and London up to Nineteen Eighty-Four. Anshel Pfeffer asks \"Was [0] an anti-Semite?\" in the Israeli daily Haaretz. Paul Seeliger, editor of the compilation of [0]'s texts On Jews and Antisemitism, describes [0]'s relationship to antisemitism and Jewish issues as \"ambivalent\".Writing in early 1945 a long essay titled \"Antisemitism in Britain\", for the Contemporary Jewish Record, [0] stated that antisemitism was on the increase in Britain and that antisemitism was \"irrational and will not yield to arguments\". [0] argued that it would be useful to discover why anti-Semites could \"swallow such absurdities on one particular subject while remaining sane on others\". [0] wrote: \"For quite six years the English admirers of Adolf Hitler's contrived not to learn of the existence of Dachau and Buchenwald.\u00a0... Many English people have heard almost nothing about the extermination of German and Polish Jews during the present war. Many English people's own anti-Semitism has caused the extermination of German and Polish Jews during the present war to bounce off Many English people's consciousness.\" In Nineteen Eighty-Four, written shortly after the war, [0] portrayed the British Independent Labour Party as enlisting anti-Semitic passions against the British Independent Labour Party's enemy, Goldstein.[0] joined the staff of Tribune magazine as literary editor, and from then until [0]'s death, was a left-wing (though hardly orthodox) Labour-supporting democratic socialist.On 1 September 1944, writing about the Warsaw uprising, [0] expressed in Tribune magazine [0]'s hostility against the influence of the alliance with the USSR over the allies: \"Do remember that dishonesty and cowardice always have to be paid for. Do not imagine that for years on end you can make yourself the boot-licking propagandist of the sovietic regime, or any other regime, and then suddenly return to honesty and reason. Once a whore, always a whore.\" According to biographer John Newsinger:\"The, although [0] \"was always critical of the 1945\u201351 Labour government's moderation, [0]'s support for the 1945\u201351 Labour government's moderation began to pull [0] to the right politically. began did not lead [0] to embrace conservatism, imperialism or reaction, but to defend, albeit critically, Labour reformism.\" Between 1945 and 1947, with A. J. Ayer and Bertrand Russell, [0] contributed a series of articles and essays to Polemic, a short-lived British \"Magazine of Philosophy, Psychology, and Aesthetics\" edited by the ex-Communist Humphrey Slater.[0] publicly defended P.

MI5, the intelligence department of the Home Office, noted: \"It is evident from [0]'s recent writings\u2014'The Lion and the Unicorn'\u2014and [0]'s contribution to Gollancz's symposium The Betrayal of the Left that [0] does not hold with the British Independent Labour Party nor the British Independent Labour Party with [0].\"", "Sexuality": "George Orwell is our person to focus on. Sexual politics plays an important role in [0]. In [0], people's intimate relationships are strictly governed by the party's Junior Anti-Sex League, by opposing sexual relations and instead encouraging artificial insemination. Personally, George Orwell disliked what George Orwell thought as misguided middle-class revolutionary emancipatory views, expressing disdain for \"every fruit-juice drinker, nudist, sandal-wearer, sex-maniacs\".George Orwell was also openly against homosexuality, at a time when such prejudice was common. Speaking at the 2003 George Orwell Centenary Conference, Daphne Patai said: \"Of course George Orwell was homophobic. was has nothing to do with George Orwell's relations with George Orwell's homosexual friends. Certainly, George Orwell had a negative attitude and a certain kind of anxiety, a denigrating attitude towards homosexuality. had is definitely the case. Daphne Patai think George Orwell's writing reflects had quite fully.George Orwell used the homophobic epithets \"nancy\" and \"pansy\", for example, in expressions of contempt for what George Orwell called the \"pansy Left\", and \"nancy poets\", i.e. left-wing homosexual or bisexual writers and intellectuals such as Stephen Spender and W.

Various recollections and interpretations were published in the 1950s and 1960s, but his widow, Sonia Brownell, saw the 1968 Collected Works as the record of his life. his widow, Sonia Brownell, did appoint Malcolm Muggeridge as official biographer, but later biographers have seen appoint as deliberate spoiling as Malcolm Muggeridge eventually gave up the work. In 1972, two American authors, Peter Stansky and William Abrahams, produced The Unknown Orwell, an unauthorised account of [0]'s early years that lacked any support or contribution from his widow, Sonia Brownell,.his widow, Sonia Brownell, then commissioned Bernard Crick, a professor of politics at the University of London, to complete a biography and asked [0]'s friends to co-operate. Bernard Crick, a professor of politics at the University of London, collated a considerable amount of material in Bernard Crick, a professor of politics at the University of London,'s work, which was published in 1980, but Bernard Crick, a professor of politics at the University of London,'s questioning of the factual accuracy of Orwell's first-person writings led to conflict with his widow, Sonia Brownell,, and his widow, Sonia Brownell, tried to suppress a biography. Bernard Crick, a professor of politics at the University of London, concentrated on the facts of his life rather than his character, and presented primarily a political perspective on [0]'s life and work.After his widow, Sonia Brownell,'s death, other works on Orwell were published in the 1980s, particularly in 1984. other works on Orwell included collections of reminiscences by Audrey Coppard and Bernard Crick, a professor of politics at the University of London, and Stephen Wadhams.In 1991, Michael Shelden, an American professor of literature, published a biography. More concerned with the literary nature of [0]'s work, Michael Shelden, an American professor of literature, sought explanations for his character and treated Orwell's first-person writings as autobiographical. Michael Shelden, an American professor of literature, introduced new information that sought to build on Bernard Crick, a professor of politics at the University of London,'s work. Michael Shelden, an American professor of literature, speculated that [0] possessed an obsessive belief in [0]'s failure and inadequacy.Peter Davison's publication of the Complete Works of [0], completed in 2000, made most of the [0] Archive accessible to the public.
