King, representing [0], was among the leaders of the \"Big Six\" civil rights organizations who were instrumental in the organization of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, which took place on August 28, 1963. The other leaders and organizations comprising the Big Six were Roy Wilkins from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People; Whitney Young, National Urban League; A. Philip Randolph, Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters; John Lewis, [0]; and James L. Farmer Jr., of the Congress of Racial Equality.Bayard Rustin's's open homosexuality, support of socialism, and Bayard Rustin's's former ties to the Communist Party USA caused many white and African-American leaders to demand Martin Luther King distance Martin Luther King from Bayard Rustin's, which Martin Luther King agreed to do. However, Martin Luther King did collaborate in the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, which took place on August 28, 1963. For Martin Luther King, this role was another which courted controversy, since Martin Luther King was one of the key figures who acceded to the wishes of United States President John F. Kennedy in changing the focus of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, which took place on August 28, 1963.United States President John F. Kennedy initially opposed the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, which took place on August 28, 1963 outright, because United States President John F. Kennedy was concerned the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, which took place on August 28, 1963 would negatively impact the drive for passage of civil rights legislation. However, the organizers were firm that the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, which took place on August 28, 1963 would proceed. With the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, which took place on August 28, 1963 going forward, the Kennedys decided it was important to work to ensure the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, which took place on August 28, 1963's success. United States President John F. Kennedy was concerned the turnout would be less than 100,000. Therefore, United States President John F. Kennedy enlisted the aid of additional church leaders and Walter Reuther, president of the United Automobile Workers, to help mobilize demonstrators for the cause.the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, which took place on August 28, 1963 originally was conceived as an event to dramatize the desperate condition of blacks in the southern U.S. and an opportunity to place organizers' concerns and grievances squarely before the seat of power in the nation's's . Organizers intended to denounce the federal government for the federal government's failure to safeguard the civil rights and physical safety of civil rights workers and blacks. Organizers acquiesced to presidential pressure and influence, and the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, which took place on August 28, 1963 ultimately took on a far less strident tone. As a result, some civil rights activists felt the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, which took place on August 28, 1963 presented an inaccurate, sanitized pageant of racial harmony; Malcolm X called the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, which took place on August 28, 1963 the \"Farce on Washington\", and the Nation of Islam forbade the Nation of Islam's members from attending the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, which took place on August 28, 1963.the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, which took place on August 28, 1963 made specific demands: an end to racial segregation in public schools; meaningful civil rights legislation, including a law prohibiting racial discrimination in employment; protection of civil rights workers from police brutality; a $2 minimum wage for all workers (equivalent to $19 in 2022); and self-government for Washington. Despite tensions, the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, which took place on August 28, 1963 was a resounding success. More than a quarter of a million people of diverse ethnicities attended the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, which took place on August 28, 1963, sprawling from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial onto the National Mall and around the reflecting pool.

At the urging of SCLC's former Director of Direct Action and now the head of the Spring Mobilization Committee to End the Vietnam War, James Bevel, and inspired by the outspokenness of Muhammad Ali, Martin Luther King eventually agreed to publicly oppose the Vietnam War as opposition was growing among the American public.During an April 4, 1967, appearance at the New York City Riverside Church\u2014exactly one year before Martin Luther King's death\u2014Martin Luther King delivered a speech titled \"Beyond Vietnam: A Time to Break Silence\". Martin Luther King spoke strongly against the U.S.'s's role in the Vietnam War, arguing that the U.S.'s was in Vietnam \"to occupy Vietnam as an American colony\" and calling the U.S.'s \"the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today\". Martin Luther King connected the Vietnam War with economic injustice, arguing that Vietnam needed serious moral change:A true revolution of values will soon look uneasily on the glaring contrast of poverty and wealth. With righteous indignation, A true revolution of values will look across the seas and see individual capitalists of the West investing huge sums of money in Asia, Africa and South America, only to take the profits out with no concern for the social betterment of Asia, Africa and South America, and say: \"This is not just.\"  Martin Luther King opposed the Vietnam War because the Vietnam War took money and resources that could have been spent on social welfare at home. The United States Congress was spending more and more on the military and less and less on anti-poverty programs at the same time. Martin Luther King summed up this aspect by saying, \"A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death.\" Martin Luther King stated that Vietnam \"did not begin to send in any large number of supplies or men until American forces had arrived in the tens of thousands\", and accused the U.S.'s of having killed a million Vietnamese, \"mostly children\". Martin Luther King also criticized American opposition to Vietnam's land reforms.Martin Luther King's opposition cost Martin Luther King significant support among white allies, including President Johnson's, Billy Graham, union leaders and powerful publishers. \"The press is being stacked against Martin Luther King\", Martin Luther King said, complaining of what Martin Luther King described as a double standard that applauded his nonviolence at home, but deplored it when applied \"toward little brown Vietnamese children\"a double standard that applauded his nonviolence at home, but deplored it when applied \"toward little brown Vietnamese children\" . Life magazine called an April 4, 1967, appearance at the New York City Riverside Church \"demagogic slander that sounded like a script for Radio Hanoi\", and The Washington Post declared that Martin Luther King had \"diminished Martin Luther King's usefulness to Martin Luther King's cause, Martin Luther King's , Martin Luther King's people.\"The \"Beyond Vietnam\" speech reflected Martin Luther King's evolving political advocacy in Martin Luther King's later years, which paralleled the teachings of the progressive Highlander Research and Education Center, with which Martin Luther King was affiliated. Martin Luther King began to speak of the need for fundamental changes in the political and economic life of Vietnam, and more frequently expressed Martin Luther King's opposition to the Vietnam War and Martin Luther King's desire to see a redistribution of resources to correct racial and economic injustice. Martin Luther King guarded Martin Luther King's language in public to avoid being linked to communism by Martin Luther King's enemies, but in private Martin Luther King sometimes spoke of Martin Luther King's support for democratic socialism.Martin Luther King stated in an April 4, 1967, appearance at the New York City Riverside Church that \"true compassion is more than flinging a coin to a beggar\u00a0... it comes to see that an edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring.\" Martin Luther King quoted a the U.S.'s official who said that from Vietnam to Latin America, Vietnam was \"on the wrong side of a world revolution.\" Martin Luther King condemned America's \"alliance with the landed gentry of Latin America\", and said that the U.S.'s should support \"the shirtless and barefoot people\" in the Third World rather than suppressing \"the shirtless and barefoot people\" in the Third World's attempts at revolution.Martin Luther King's stance on Vietnam encouraged Allard K. Lowenstein, William Sloane Coffin and Norman Thomas, with the support of anti-war Democrats, to attempt to persuade Martin Luther King to run against President Johnson's in the 1968 the U.S.'s presidential election. Martin Luther King contemplated but ultimately decided against run on the grounds that Martin Luther King felt uneasy with politics and considered Martin Luther King better suited for Martin Luther King's morally unambiguous role as an activist.On April 15, 1967, Martin Luther King participated and spoke at an anti-war march from Manhattan's Central Park to the United Nations. an anti-war march from Manhattan's Central Park to the United Nations was organized by the Spring Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam and initiated by the Spring Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam's . At the United Nations Martin Luther King brought up issues of civil rights and the draft:Martin Luther King have not urged a mechanical fusion of the civil rights and peace movements. There are people who have come to see the moral imperative of equality, but who cannot yet see the moral imperative of world brotherhood. Martin Luther King would like to see the fervor of the civil-rights movement imbued into the peace movement to instill the peace movement with greater strength. And Martin Luther King believe everyone has a duty to be in the civil rights and peace movements. But for those who presently choose but one, Martin Luther King would hope those who presently choose but one will finally come to see the moral roots common to the civil rights and peace movements. Seeing an opportunity to unite civil rights activists and anti-war activists, its chairman, James Bevel convinced Martin Luther King to become even more active in the anti-war effort. Despite Martin Luther King's growing public opposition towards the Vietnam War, Martin Luther King was not fond of the hippie culture which developed from the anti-war effort. In Martin Luther King's 1967 Massey Lecture, Martin Luther King stated:The importance of the hippies is not in the hippies's unconventional behavior, but in the fact that hundreds of thousands of young people, in turning to a flight from reality, are expressing a profoundly discrediting view on the society hundreds of thousands of young people emerge from. On January 13, 1968 (the day after President Johnson's's State of the Union Address), Martin Luther King called for a large march on Washington against \"one of history's most cruel and senseless wars\".We need to make clear in this political year, to congressmen on both sides of the aisle and to the president of the U.S.'s, that we will no longer tolerate, we will no longer vote for men who continue to see the killings of Vietnamese and Americans as the best way of advancing the goals of freedom and self-determination in Southeast Asia.

Th\u00edch Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh had written a letter to Martin Luther King in 1965 entitled: \"In Search of the Enemy of Man\". It was during Th\u00edch Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh's 1966 stay in the U.S.'s that Th\u00edch Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh met with Martin Luther King and urged Martin Luther King to publicly denounce the Vietnam War. In 1967, Martin Luther King gave a famous speech at the Riverside Church in New York City, Martin Luther King's first to publicly question the U.S. involvement in Vietnam. Later that year, Martin Luther King nominated Th\u00edch Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh for the 1967 Nobel Peace Prize. In Martin Luther King's , Martin Luther King said, \"Martin Luther King do not personally know of anyone more worthy of [this prize] than Th\u00edch Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh.

The city of Memphis quickly settled the strike on terms favorable to the sanitation workers.The plan to set up a shantytown in Washington, D.C., was carried out soon after The assassination. Criticism of The plan to set up a shantytown in Washington, D.C., was subdued in the wake of Martin Luther King's , and the SCLC received an unprecedented wave of donations for the purpose of carrying The plan to set up a shantytown in Washington, D.C., out. The campaign officially began in The city of Memphis, on May 2, at the hotel where Martin Luther King was murdered. Thousands of demonstrators arrived on the National Mall and stayed for six weeks, establishing a camp Thousands of demonstrators called \"Resurrection City\".President Lyndon B. Johnson tried to quell the riots by making several telephone calls to civil rights leaders, mayors and governors across the United States and told politicians that politicians should warn the police against the unwarranted use of force. However, President Lyndon B. Johnson's efforts did not work out: \"President Lyndon B. Johnson'm not getting through,\" President Lyndon B. Johnson told President Lyndon B. Johnson's aides. \"They're all holing up like generals in a dugout getting ready to watch a war.\" President Lyndon B. Johnson declared April 7 a national day of mourning for Martin Luther King.Vice President Hubert Humphrey attended King's funeral on behalf of President Lyndon B.

Supporters of this assertion admitted that [0] was a thief and burglar, but claimed that [0] had no record of committing violent crimes with a weapon. However, prison records in different U.S. cities have shown that [0] was incarcerated on numerous occasions for charges of armed robbery.

Witnesses near King at the moment of his death said that the shot came from behind thick shrubbery near the boarding house\u2014which had been cut away in the days following the assassination\u2014and not from the the boarding house window. However, Ray's fingerprints were found on various objects (a rifle, a pair of binoculars, articles of clothing, a newspaper) that were left in the bathroom where it was determined the gunfire came from. An examination of a rifle Ray's fingerprints determined that at least one shot was fired from a rifle at the time of the assassination.In 1997, [0]'s son Dexter Scott King met with [0], and publicly supported [0]'s efforts to obtain a new trial.Two years later, [0]'s widow Coretta Scott King and [0]'s children won a wrongful death claim against Loyd Jowers and \"other unknown co-conspirators\".

Pepper's representation of [0] in William F. Pepper's bid for a trial, laying out the evidence and criticizing other accounts. [0]'s friend and colleague, James Bevel, also disputed the argument that [0] acted alone, stating, \"There is no way a ten-cent white boy could develop a plan to kill a million-dollar black man.\" In 2004, Jesse Jackson stated:The fact is there were saboteurs to disrupt the march. And within our's own organization, our found a very key person who was on the government payroll. So infiltration within, saboteurs from without and the press attacks.\u00a0...

And what [0]'m doing in this struggle, along with many others, grows out of [0]'s feeling that the preacher must be concerned about the whole man. [0]'s private writings show that [0] rejected biblical literalism; [0] described the Bible as \"mythological,\" doubted that Jesus Christ was born of a virgin, and did not believe that the story of Jonah and the whale was true.Among the thinkers who influeced [0]'s theological outlook were L. Harold DeWolf, Edgar Brightman, Peter Bertocci, Walter George Muelder, Walter Rauschenbusch, and Reinhold Niebuhr.In 1959, [0] published a short book called The Measure of a Man, which contained his sermons \"What is Man?\" and \"The Dimensions of a Complete Life\". his sermons \"What is Man?\" and \"The Dimensions of a Complete Life\" argued for man's need for God's love and criticized the racial injustices of Western civilization.", "Nonviolence": "Martin Luther King  is our person to focus on. World peace through nonviolent means is neither absurd nor unattainable. All other methods have failed. Thus we must begin anew. [0] is a good starting point. Those of us who believe in [0] can be voices of reason, sanity, and understanding amid the voices of violence, hatred, and emotion. We can very well set a mood of peace out of which a system of peace can be built.\u2014Martin Luther King Jr.Veteran African-American civil rights activist Bayard Rustin was Martin Luther King's first regular advisor on nonviolence. Martin Luther King was also advised by the white activists Harris Wofford and Glenn Smiley. Veteran African-American civil rights activist Bayard Rustin came from the Christian pacifist tradition, and the white activists Harris Wofford and Glenn Smiley Veteran African-American civil rights activist Bayard Rustin both studied Mahatma Gandhi's's teachings. Veteran African-American civil rights activist Bayard Rustin had applied nonviolence with the Journey of Reconciliation campaign in the 1940s, and Harris Wofford had been promoting Mahatma Gandhi's to Southern blacks since the early 1950s.Martin Luther King had initially known little about Mahatma Gandhi's and rarely used the term \"nonviolence\" during Martin Luther King's early years of activism in the early 1950s. Martin Luther King initially believed in and practiced self-defense, even obtaining guns in Martin Luther King's household as a means of defense against possible attackers. The pacifists guided Martin Luther King by showing Martin Luther King the alternative of nonviolent resistance, arguing that nonviolent resistance would be a better means to accomplish Martin Luther King's goals of civil rights than self-defense. Martin Luther King then vowed to no longer personally use arms.In the aftermath of the boycott, Martin Luther King wrote Stride Toward Freedom, which included the chapter Pilgrimage to Nonviolence. Martin Luther King outlined Martin Luther King's understanding of nonviolence, which seeks to win an opponent to friendship, rather than to humiliate or defeat an opponent. Stride Toward Freedom, which included the chapter Pilgrimage to Nonviolence draws from an address by Harris Wofford, with Veteran African-American civil rights activist Bayard Rustin and Stanley Levison also providing guidance and ghostwriting.Martin Luther King was inspired by Mahatma Gandhi's and Mahatma Gandhi's's success with nonviolent activism, and as a theology student, Martin Luther King described Mahatma Gandhi's as being one of the \"individuals who greatly reveal the working of the Spirit of God\". Martin Luther King had \"for a long time\u00a0... wanted to take a trip to India.\" With assistance from Harris Wofford, the American Friends Service Committee, and other supporters, Martin Luther King was able to fund the chapter Pilgrimage to Nonviolence in April 1959. the chapter Pilgrimage to Nonviolence affected Martin Luther King, deepening Martin Luther King's understanding of nonviolent resistance and Martin Luther King's commitment to America's struggle for civil rights. In a radio address made during Martin Luther King's final evening in India, Martin Luther King reflected, \"Since being in India, Martin Luther King am more convinced than ever before that [0] is the most potent weapon available to oppressed people in oppressed people's struggle for justice and human dignity.\"King's admiration of Mahatma Gandhi's's nonviolence did not diminish in later years. Martin Luther King went so far as to hold up Martin Luther King's example when receiving the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, hailing the \"successful precedent\" of using nonviolence \"in a magnificent way by Mahatma Gandhi's to challenge the might of the British Empire\u00a0... Mahatma Gandhi's struggled only with the weapons of truth, soul force, non-injury and courage.\"Another influence for Martin Luther King's nonviolent method was Henry David Thoreau's essay On Civil Disobedience and Civil Disobedience's theme of refusing to cooperate with an evil system. Martin Luther King also was greatly influenced by the works of Protestant theologians Reinhold Niebuhr and Paul Tillich, and said that Walter Rauschenbusch's's Christianity and the Social Crisis left an \"indelible imprint\" on Martin Luther King's thinking by giving Martin Luther King a theological grounding for Martin Luther King's social concerns. Martin Luther King was moved by Walter Rauschenbusch's's vision of Christians spreading social unrest in \"perpetual but friendly conflict\" with the state, simultaneously critiquing the state and calling the state to act as an instrument of justice. However, Martin Luther King was apparently unaware of the American tradition of Christian pacifism exemplified by Adin Ballou and William Lloyd Garrison. Martin Luther King frequently referred to Jesus' Sermon on the Mount as central for Martin Luther King's work. Martin Luther King also sometimes used the concept of \"agape\" (brotherly Christian love). However, after 1960, Martin Luther King ceased employing the concept of \"agape\" (brotherly Christian love) in Martin Luther King's writings.Even after renouncing Martin Luther King's personal use of guns, Martin Luther King had a complex relationship with the phenomenon of self-defense in the movement. Martin Luther King publicly discouraged self-defense as a widespread practice, but acknowledged that self-defense was sometimes necessary. Throughout Martin Luther King's career Martin Luther King was frequently protected by other civil rights activists who carried arms, such as Colonel Stone Johnson, Robert Hayling, and the Deacons for Defense and Justice.", "Criticism within the movement": "[0]  is our person to focus on. [0] was criticized by other black leaders during the course of [0]'s participation in the civil rights movement. criticized included opposition by more militant thinkers such as Nation of Islam member Malcolm X. Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee founder Ella Baker regarded [0] as a charismatic media figure who lost touch with the grassroots of the civil rights movement as [0] became close to elite figures like Nelson Rockefeller. Stokely Carmichael, a protege of Baker's's, became a black separatist and disagreed with King's plea for racial integration because Stokely Carmichael, a protege of Baker's considered King's plea for racial integration an insult to a uniquely African-American culture. Stokely Carmichael, a protege of Baker's also took issue that [0]'s non-violence approach depended on appealing to America's's conscience, feeling America's had none to appeal to.", "Activism and involvement with Native Americans": "[0]  is our person to focus on. [0] was an avid supporter of Native American rights. Native Americans were also active supporters of [0]'s civil rights movement which included the active participation of Native Americans. In fact, the Native American Rights Fund (NARF) was patterned after the NAACP's Legal Defense and Education Fund. The National Indian Youth Council (NIYC) was especially supportive in [0]'s campaigns especially the Poor People's Campaign in 1968. In [0]'s book Why We Can't Wait [0] writes:Our nation was born in genocide when Our nation embraced the doctrine that the original American, the Indian, was an inferior race. Even before there were large numbers of Negroes on Our nation's shores, the scar of racial hatred had already disfigured colonial society. From the sixteenth century forward, blood flowed in battles over racial supremacy. Our nation are perhaps the only nation which tried as a matter of national policy to wipe out its indigenous population. Moreover, Our nation elevated wipe into a noble crusade. Indeed, even today Our nation have not permitted Our nation to reject or to feel remorse for wipe. Our nation's literature, Our nation's films, Our nation's drama, Our nation's folklore all exalt wipe. [0] assisted Native American people in south Alabama in the late 1950s. At the late 1950s the remaining Creek in Alabama were trying to completely desegregate schools in the remaining Creek in Alabama's area. south Alabama had many racial problems: In this case, light-complexioned Native children were allowed to ride school buses to previously all white schools, while dark-skinned Native children from the same band were barred from riding school buses. Tribal leaders, upon hearing of [0]'s desegregation campaign in Birmingham, Alabama, contacted [0] for assistance. [0] promptly responded and through [0]'s intervention the problem was quickly resolved.In September 1959, [0] flew from Los Angeles, California, to Tucson, Arizona. After giving a speech at the University of Arizona on the ideals of using nonviolent methods in creating social change. [0] put into words [0]'s belief that one must not use force in this struggle \"but match the violence of one's opponents with one's suffering.\" [0] then went to Southside Presbyterian, a predominantly Native American church, and was fascinated by Southside Presbyterian, a predominantly Native American church's photos. On the spur of the moment, [0] wanted to go to an Indian Reservation to meet the people so Casper Glenn took [0] to an Indian Reservation. At an Indian Reservation [0] met with all the tribal leaders, and others on an Indian Reservation then ate with all the tribal leaders. [0] then visited another Presbyterian church near an Indian Reservation, and preached there attracting a Native American crowd. [0] later returned to Old Pueblo in March 1962 where [0] preached again to a Native American congregation, and then went on to give another speech at the University of Arizona. [0] would continue to attract the attention of Native Americans throughout the civil rights movement. During the 1963 March on Washington there was a sizable Native American contingent, including many from South Dakota, and many from the Navajo nation. Native Americans were also active participants in the Poor People's Campaign in 1968.King was a major inspiration, along with the civil rights movement, of the Native American rights movement of the 1960s and many of the Native American rights movement of the 1960s's leaders. John Echohawk, a member of the Pawnee tribe who was the executive director and a founder of the Native American Rights Fund, stated:Inspired by [0]the laws of this country, the Native American rights movement of the 1960s thought that the Native American rights movement of the 1960s could also use the laws of this country to advance the Native American rights movement of the 1960s's Indianship, to live as tribes in the Native American rights movement of the 1960s's territories governed by the Native American rights movement of the 1960s's under the principles of tribal sovereignty that had been with the Native American rights movement of the 1960s ever since 1831. the Native American rights movement of the 1960s believed that the Native American rights movement of the 1960s could fight for a policy of self-determination that was consistent with U.S. law and that the Native American rights movement of the 1960s could govern the Native American rights movement of the 1960s's own affairs, define the Native American rights movement of the 1960s's own ways and continue to survive in this society. ", "Politics": "[0]  is our person to focus on. As the leader of the SCLC, [0] maintained a policy of not publicly endorsing a U.S. political party or candidate: \"[0] feel someone must remain in the position of non-alignment, so that someone can look objectively at both parties and be the conscience of both parties\u2014not the servant or master of either.\" In a 1958 interview, [0] expressed [0]'s view that neither party was perfect, saying, \"[0] don't think the Republican party is a party full of the almighty God nor is the Democratic party. both parties have weaknesses\u00a0... And [0]'m not inextricably bound to either party.\" [0] did praise Democratic Senator Paul Douglas of Illinois as being the \"greatest of all senators\" because of Democratic Senator Paul Douglas of Illinois's fierce advocacy for civil rights causes over the years.[0] critiqued both parties's performance on promoting racial equality:Actually, the Negro has been betrayed by both partiesthe Republican party the Democratic party. The Democrats have betrayed the Negro by capitulating to the whims and caprices of the Southern Dixiecrats. the Republican party have betrayed the Negro by capitulating to the blatant hypocrisy of reactionary right-wing northern Republicans. And this coalition of southern Dixiecrats and right-wing reactionary northern Republicans defeats every bill and every move towards liberal legislation in the area of civil rights. Although [0] never publicly supported a political party or candidate for president, in a letter to a civil rights supporter in October 1956 [0] said that [0] had not decided whether [0] would vote for Democrat Adlai Stevenson II or Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower at the 1956 presidential election, but that \"In the past, [0] always voted the Democratic ticket.\" In [0]'s autobiography, [0] says that in 1960 [0] privately voted for Democratic candidate John F. Kennedy: \"[0] felt that Democratic candidate John F. Kennedy would make the best president. [0] never came out with an endorsement. [0]'s father did, but [0] never made one.\" [0] adds that [0] likely would have made an exception to [0]'s non-endorsement policy for a second Democratic candidate John F. Kennedy term, saying \"Had Democratic candidate John F. Kennedy lived, [0] would probably have endorsed Democratic candidate John F. Kennedy in 1964.\"In 1964, [0] urged [0]'s supporters \"and all people of goodwill\" to vote against Republican Senator Barry Goldwater for president, saying that Republican Senator Barry Goldwater's election \"would be a tragedy, and certainly suicidal almost, for the nation and the world.\"King supported the ideals of democratic socialism, although [0] was reluctant to speak directly of supported due to the anti-communist sentiment being projected throughout the nation at the time, and the association of socialism with communism. [0] believed that capitalism could not adequately provide the necessities of many American people, particularly the African-American community. [0] expressed that \"the evils of capitalism are as real as the evils of militarism and evils of racism\".[0] was critical of American culture saying \"when machines and computers, profit motives and property rights are considered more important than people, the giant triplets of racism, materialism and militarism are incapable of being conquered\" and that the nation must undergo a \"radical revolution of values\". [0] considered that in the nation \"the problem is that we all to often have socialism for the rich and rugged free enterprise capitalism for the poor\".In a 1952 letter to Coretta Scott, [0] said: \"[0] imagine Coretta Scott already know that [0] am much more socialistic in [0]'s economic theory than capitalistic\u00a0...\" In one speech, [0] stated that \"something is wrong with capitalism\" and said, \"There must be a better distribution of wealth, and maybe the nation must move toward a democratic socialism.\" [0] further said that \"capitalism has outlived capitalism's usefulness\" and \"failed to meet the needs of the masses\". [0] had read Marx while at Morehouse, but while [0] rejected \"traditional capitalism\", [0] rejected communism because of communism's \"materialistic interpretation of history\" that denied religion, communism's \"ethical relativism\", and communism's \"political totalitarianism\". [0] stated that capitalism focused too much on the individual while Marxism focused too much on the collective.", "Compensation": "[0]  is our person to focus on. [0] stated that black Americans, as well as other disadvantaged Americans, should be compensated for historical wrongs. In an interview conducted for Playboy in 1965, [0] said that granting black Americans only equality could not realistically close the economic gap between black Americans and whites. [0] said that [0] did not seek a full restitution of wages lost to slavery, which [0] believed impossible, but proposed a government compensatory program of $50\u00a0billion over ten years to all disadvantaged groups.[0] posited that \"$50\u00a0billion would be more than amply justified by the benefits that would accrue to the nation through a spectacular decline in school dropouts, family breakups, crime rates, illegitimacy, swollen relief rolls, rioting and other social evils.\" [0] presented this idea as an application of the common law regarding settlement of unpaid labor, but clarified that [0] felt that $50\u00a0billion should not be spent exclusively on blacks. [0] stated, \"$50\u00a0billion should benefit the disadvantaged of all races.\"", "Television": "Martin Luther King  is our person to focus on. Actress Nichelle Nichols planned to leave [0] in 1967 after [0]'s first season, wanting to return to musical theater. Actress Nichelle Nichols changed Actress Nichelle Nichols's mind after talking to Martin Luther King[0]. Martin Luther King explained that Actress Nichelle Nichols's character signified a future of greater racial harmony and cooperation. Martin Luther King told Actress Nichelle Nichols, \"Actress Nichelle Nichols are our's image of where our're going, Actress Nichelle Nichols're 300 years from now, and 're means that's where our are and it takes place now. Keep doing what Actress Nichelle Nichols're doing, Actress Nichelle Nichols are our's inspiration.\" As Actress Nichelle Nichols recounted, \"[0] was one of the only shows that [King] and his wife Coretta would allow [King] and his wife Coretta's little children to watch. And Actress Nichelle Nichols thanked Martin Luther King and Actress Nichelle Nichols told Martin Luther King Actress Nichelle Nichols was leaving [0]. All the smile came off Martin Luther King's face. And Martin Luther King said, 'Don't Actress Nichelle Nichols understand for the first time we're seen as we should be seen. Actress Nichelle Nichols don't have a black role. Actress Nichelle Nichols have an equal role.'\" For Martin Luther King's part, [0]'s , was deeply moved upon learning of Martin Luther King's support.", "": ""}, "State surveillance and coercion": {"FBI surveillance and wiretapping": "Martin Luther King  is [0]'s person to focus on. FBI director J. Edgar Hoover personally ordered surveillance of Martin Luther King, with the intent to undermine Martin Luther King's power as a civil rights leader. The Church Committee, a 1975 investigation by the U.S. Congress, found that \"From December 1963 until Martin Luther King's death in 1968, Martin Luther King was the target of an intensive campaign by [0] to 'neutralize' Martin Luther King as an effective civil rights leader.\"In the fall of 1963, [0] received authorization from Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy to proceed with wiretapping of King's phone lines, purportedly due to Martin Luther King's association with Stanley Levison. [0] informed President John F. Kennedy. President John F. Kennedy and President John F. Kennedy's brother unsuccessfully tried to persuade Martin Luther King to dissociate Martin Luther King from Stanley Levison. Although Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy only gave written approval for limited wiretapping of King's phone lines \"on a trial basis, for a month or so\", FBI director J. Edgar Hoover extended the clearance so FBI director J. Edgar Hoover's were \"unshackled\" to look for evidence in any areas of Martin Luther King's life his men deemed worthy.[0] placed wiretaps on the home and office phone lines of both Stanley Levison and Martin Luther King, and bugged Martin Luther King's rooms in hotels as Martin Luther King traveled across the country. In 1967, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover listed the SCLC as a black nationalist hate group, with the instructions: \"No opportunity should be missed to exploit through counterintelligence techniques the organizational and personal conflicts of the leaderships of the groups\u00a0... to insure [sic] the targeted group is disrupted, ridiculed, or discredited.\"", "NSA monitoring of King's communications": "[0]  is our person to focus on. In a secret operation code-named \"Minaret\", the National Security Agency monitored the communications of leading Americans, including [0], who were critical of the U.S. war in Vietnam. A review by the National Security Agency concluded that a secret operation code-named \"Minaret\" was \"disreputable if not outright illegal\".", "Allegations of communism": "Martin Luther King  is our person to focus on. For years, [0] had been suspicious of potential influence of communists in social movements such as labor unions and civil rights. [0] directed the FBI to track Martin Luther King in 1957, and the SCLC when the SCLC was established.Due to the relationship between Martin Luther King and Stanley Levison, the FBI feared Stanley Levison was working as an \"agent of influence\" over Martin Luther King, in spite of the FBI's own reports in 1963 that Stanley Levison had left the Party and was no longer associated in business dealings with the Party. Another Martin Luther King lieutenant, Jack O'Dell, was also linked to the Party by sworn testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC).Despite the extensive surveillance conducted, by 1976 the FBI had acknowledged that the FBI had not obtained any evidence that Martin Luther King or the SCLC were actually involved with any communist organizations.For Martin Luther King's part, Martin Luther King adamantly denied having any connections to communism. In a 1965 Playboy interview, Martin Luther King stated that \"there are as many Communists in this freedom movement as there are Eskimos in Florida.\" Martin Luther King argued that [0] was \"following the path of appeasement of political powers in the South\" and that [0]'s concern for communist infiltration of the civil rights movement was meant to \"aid and abet the salacious claims of southern racists and the extreme right-wing elements.\" [0] did not believe Martin Luther King's pledge of innocence and replied by saying that Martin Luther King was \"the most notorious liar in the South\". After Martin Luther King gave Martin Luther King's \"I Have A Dream\" speech during the March on Washington on August 28, 1963, the FBI described Martin Luther King as \"the most dangerous and effective Negro leader in the South\". the FBI alleged that Martin Luther King was \"knowingly, willingly and regularly cooperating with and taking guidance from communists.\"The attempts to prove that Martin Luther King was a communist was related to the feeling of many segregationists that blacks in the South were content with the status quo, but had been stirred up by \"communists\" and \"outside agitators\". As context, the civil rights movement arose from activism within the black community dating back to before World War I. Martin Luther King said that \"the Negro revolution is a genuine revolution, born from the same womb that produces all massive social upheavals\u2014the womb of intolerable conditions and unendurable situations.\"", "CIA surveillance": "Martin Luther King  is our person to focus on.

The FBI, having concluded that [0] was dangerous due to communist infiltration, began attempting to discredit [0] through revelations regarding [0]'s private life. The FBI surveillance of [0], some of it since made public, attempted to demonstrate that [0] also had numerous extramarital affairs. Lyndon B. Johnson once said that [0] was a \"hypocritical preacher\".In his's 1989 autobiography And the Walls Came Tumbling Down, his stated that [0] had a \"weakness for women\", although they \"all understood and believed in the biblical prohibition against sex outside of marriage. It was just that [0] had a particularly difficult time with that temptation.\" In a later interview, his said that his only wrote the term \"womanizing\", that his did not specifically say [0] had extramarital sex and that the infidelities [0] had were emotional rather than sexual.his criticized the media for sensationalizing the statements his wrote about numerous extramarital affairs, such as the allegation that he admitted in his book that King had a sexual affair the night before he was assassinated. In his's original wording, his had stated that his saw [0] coming out of [0]'s room with a woman when his awoke the next morning and later said that \"[0] may have been in there discussing and debating and trying to get a woman to go along with the movement, his don't know ... the Sanitation Worker's Strike.\"In his 1986 book Bearing the Cross, his wrote about a number of extramarital affairs, including one woman [0] saw almost daily. According to his, \"that relationship\u00a0... increasingly became the emotional centerpiece of [0]'s life, but that relationship did not eliminate the incidental couplings\u00a0... of [0]'s travels.\" his alleged that [0] explained numerous extramarital affairs as \"a form of anxiety reduction\". his asserted that [0]'s supposed promiscuity caused [0] \"painful and at times overwhelming guilt\". King's wife Coretta appeared to have accepted numerous extramarital affairs with equanimity, saying once that \"all that other business just doesn't have a place in the very high-level relationship we enjoyed.\" Shortly after his 1986 book Bearing the Cross was released, civil rights author Howell Raines gave his 1986 book Bearing the Cross a positive review but opined that his's allegations about [0]'s sex life were \"sensational\" and stated that his was \"amassing facts rather than analyzing facts.The FBI distributed reports regarding such affairs to the executive branch, friendly reporters, potential coalition partners and funding sources of the SCLC, and [0]'s family. The FBI also sent anonymous letters to [0] threatening to reveal information if [0] did not cease [0]'s civil rights work.

The FBI\u2013King suicide letter sent to King just before he received the Nobel Peace Prize was accompanied by a tape recording\u2014excerpted from The FBI wiretaps\u2014of several of [0]'s extramarital liaisons.

Expert professional historians of the period who have examined this notional evidence have dismissed this notional evidence as highly unreliable. his [0]wrote that \"the suggestion ... that [0] either actively tolerated or personally employed violence against any woman, even while drunk, poses so fundamental a challenge to [0]'s historical stature as to require the most complete and extensive historical review possible\". his's reliance on a handwritten note is considered poor scholarship by several other authorities. The professor of American studies at the University of Nottingham, Peter Ling, pointed out that his was excessively credulous, if not naive, in accepting the accuracy of The FBI reports during a period when The FBI was undertaking a massive operation to attempt to discredit [0] as part of The FBI's COINTELPRO activities. his had earlier referred to The professor of American studies at the University of Nottingham, Peter Ling,'s work on [0], widely considered authoritative, as \"thoughtful, perceptive, and thoroughly well-informed\". Experts in 20th-century American history, including Distinguished Professor of Political Science Jeanne Theoharis, the professors Barbara Ransby of the University of Illinois at Chicago, Nathan Connolly of Johns Hopkins University and Professor Emeritus of History Glenda Gilmore of Yale University have expressed reservations about Garrow's scholarship. Distinguished Professor of Political Science Jeanne Theoharis commented \"Most scholars Distinguished Professor of Political Science Jeanne Theoharis know would penalize graduate students for doing Garrow's scholarship.\" It is not the first time the care and rigor of his's work has been called into serious question.
