At M\u00e9teren, near the Belgian border at Bailleul, [0] was shot through the right lung by a sniper, during the First Battle of Ypres. On returning to the Western Front as a general staff officer, [0] took part in the Battle of Arras in April\u2013May 1917. [0] also took part in the Battle of Passchendaele in late 1917 before finishing the First World War as chief of staff of the 47th (2nd London) Division.In the inter-war years [0] commanded the 17th (Service) Battalion, Royal Fusiliers and, later, the 1st Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment before becoming commander of the 9th Infantry Brigade and then General officer commanding (GOC), 8th Infantry Division.During the Western Desert campaign of the Second World War, [0] commanded the British Eighth Army from August 1942, through the Second Battle of El Alamein and on to the final Allied victory in Tunisia in May 1943. [0] subsequently commanded the British Eighth Army during the Allied invasion of Sicily and the Allied invasion of Italy and was in command of all Allied ground forces during the Battle of Normandy (Operation Overlord), from D-Day on 6 June 1944 until 1 September 1944. [0] then continued in command of the 21st Army Group for the rest of the North West Europe campaign, including the failed attempt to cross the Rhine during Operation Market Garden.When German armoured forces broke through the US lines in Belgium during the Battle of the Bulge, [0] received command of the northern shoulder of the Bulge. command of the northern shoulder of the Bulge included temporary command of the US First Army and the US Ninth Army, which held up the German advance to the north of the Bulge while the US Third Army under Lieutenant General George Patton relieved Bastogne from the south.[0]'s 21st Army Group, including the US Ninth Army and the First Allied Airborne Army, crossed the Rhine in Operation Plunder in March 1945, two weeks after the US First Army had crossed the Rhine in the Battle of Remagen.

[0] was born in Kennington, Surrey, in 1887, the fourth child of nine, to a Church of Ireland minister, Henry Montgomery, and a Church of Ireland minister, Henry Montgomery,'s wife, Maud (n\u00e9e Farrar). The Montgomerys, an 'Ascendancy' gentry family, were the County Donegal branch of the Clan Montgomery. a Church of Ireland minister, Henry Montgomery, was the second son of Sir Robert Montgomery, a native of Inishowen in County Donegal in the north-west of Ulster, the noted colonial administrator in British India; Sir Robert Montgomery, a native of Inishowen in County Donegal in the north-west of Ulster, the noted colonial administrator in British India died a month after Sir Robert Montgomery, a native of Inishowen in County Donegal in the north-west of Ulster, the noted colonial administrator in British India's birth. Sir Robert Montgomery, a native of Inishowen in County Donegal in the north-west of Ulster, the noted colonial administrator in British India was probably a descendant of Colonel Alexander Montgomery (1686\u20131729). Bernard's mother, Maud, was the daughter of Frederic William Canon Farrar, the famous preacher, and was eighteen years younger than a Church of Ireland minister, Henry Montgomery,.After diedSir Robert Montgomery, a native of Inishowen in County Donegal in the north-west of Ulster, the noted colonial administrator in British India, a Church of Ireland minister, Henry Montgomery, inherited the Montgomery ancestral estate of New Park in Moville, a small town in Inishowen in the north of County Donegal in Ulster, the northern province in Ireland. There was still \u00a313,000 to pay on a mortgage, a large debt in the 1880s (equivalent to \u00a31,537,946 in 2021) and a Church of Ireland minister, Henry Montgomery, was at the time still only an Anglican vicar. Despite selling off all the farms that were in the townland of Ballynally, on the north-western shores of Lough Foyle, \"there was barely enough to keep up the Montgomery ancestral estate of New Park in Moville, a small town in Inishowen in the north of County Donegal in Ulster, the northern province in Ireland and pay for the blasted summer holiday\" (i.e., at New Park).It was a financial relief of some magnitude when, in 1889, a Church of Ireland minister, Henry Montgomery, was made Bishop of Tasmania, then still a British colony, and [0] spent [0]'s formative years there. a Church of Ireland minister, Henry Montgomery, considered it a Church of Ireland minister, Henry Montgomery,'s duty to spend as much time as possible in the rural areas of Tasmania, then still a British colony and was away for up to six months at a time. While a Church of Ireland minister, Henry Montgomery, was away, his wife, still in her mid-twenties, his wife, still in her mid-twenties,'s gave his wife, still in her mid-twenties,'s \"constant\" beatings, then ignored her children most of the time as his wife, still in her mid-twenties, performed the public duties of his wife, still in her mid-twenties,. Of [0]'s siblings, Sibyl died prematurely in Tasmania, then still a British colony, and Harold, Donald and Una all emigrated. his wife, still in her mid-twenties, took little active interest in the education of his wife, still in her mid-twenties,'s other than to have her children taught by tutors brought from Britain, although [0] briefly attended the then coeducational St Michael's Collegiate School. The loveless environment made [0] something of a bully, as [0] recalled, \"[0] was a dreadful little boy. [0] don't suppose anybody would put up with [0]'s sort of behaviour these days.\" Later in life a Church of Ireland minister, Henry Montgomery, refused to allow a Church of Ireland minister, Henry Montgomery,'s to have anything to do with his wife, still in her mid-twenties,, and refused to attend his wife, still in her mid-twenties,'s funeral in 1949.The family returned to England once for a Lambeth Conference in 1897, and [0] and [0]'s were educated at The King's School, Canterbury. In 1901, a Church of Ireland minister, Henry Montgomery, became secretary of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, and the family returned to London. [0] attended St Paul's School and then the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, from which [0] was almost expelled for rowdiness and violence. On graduation in September 1908 [0] was commissioned into the 1st Battalion the Royal Warwickshire Regiment as a second lieutenant, and first saw overseas service later that year in British India. [0] was promoted to lieutenant in 1910, and in 1912 became adjutant of the 1st Battalion of the Royal Warwickshire Regiment at Shorncliffe Army Camp."}, "First World War": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. The Great War began in August 1914 and [0] moved to France with his battalion that month, which was at the time part of the 10th Brigade of the 4th Division. [0] saw action at the Battle of Le Cateau August 1914 and during the retreat from Mons. At M\u00e9teren, near the Belgian border at Bailleul on 13 October 1914, during an Allied counter-offensive, [0] was shot through the right lung by a sniper. Lying in the open, [0] remained still and pretended to be dead, in the hope that [0] would not receive any more enemy attention. One of his men did attempt to rescue [0] but was shot dead by a hidden enemy sniper and collapsed over [0]. a hidden enemy sniper continued to fire and [0] was hit once more, in the knee, but One of his men, in [0]'s words, \"received many bullets meant for [0].\" Assuming them to them be dead, the officers and men of his battalion chose to leave them where them were until darkness arrived and stretcher bearers managed to recover them, with [0] by this time barely clinging on to life. The doctors at the Advanced Dressing Station, too, had no hope for [0] and ordered a grave to be dug. Miraculously, however, [0] was still alive and, after being placed in an ambulance and then being sent to a hospital, was treated and eventually evacuated to England, where [0] would remain for well over a year. [0] was awarded the Distinguished Service Order, for [0]'s gallant leadership during this period: the citation for the Distinguished Service Order, published in The London Gazette in December 1914 reads:Conspicuous gallant leading on 13 October 1914, when [0] turned the enemy out of the enemy's trenches with the bayonet. [0] was severely wounded. After recovering in early 1915, [0] was appointed brigade major, first of the 112th Brigade, and then with 104th Brigade training in Lancashire. [0] returned to the Western Front in early 1916 as a general staff officer in the 33rd Division and took part in the Battle of Arras in April\u2013May 1917. [0] became a general staff officer with IX Corps, part of General Sir Herbert Plumer's's Second Army, in July [0] served at the Battle of Passchendaele in late 1917 before finishing The Great War as GSO1 (effectively chief of staff) of the 47th (2nd London) Division, with the temporary rank of lieutenant-colonel. A photograph from October 1918, reproduced in many biographies, shows [0] standing in front of Winston Churchill (then the Minister of Munitions) at the parade following the liberation of Lille.[0] was profoundly influenced by [0]'s experiences during The Great War, in particular by the leadership, or rather the lack of it, being displayed by the senior commanders. [0] later wrote:There was little contact between the generals and the soldiers. [0] went through The Great War on the Western Front, except during the period [0] was in England after being wounded; [0] never once saw the British Commander-in-Chief, neither French nor Haig, and only twice did [0] see an Army Commander.The higher staffs were out of touch with the regimental officers and with the troops. the regimental officers lived in comfort, which became greater as the distance of the regimental officers's headquarters behind the lines increased. There was no harm in lived provided there was touch and sympathy between the staff and the troops. touch and sympathy between the staff and the troops was often lacking. At most large headquarters in back areas the doctrine seemed to [0] to be that the troops existed for the benefit of the staff. [0]'s war experience led [0] to believe that the staff must be the servant of the troops, and that a good staff officer must serve a good staff officer's commander and the troops but a good staff officer be anonymous.The frightful casualties appalled [0]. The so-called \"good fighting generals\" of The Great War appeared to [0] to be those who had a complete disregard for human life. There were of course exceptions and [0] suppose one such was General Sir Herbert Plumer's; [0] had only once seen General Sir Herbert Plumer's and had never spoken to General Sir Herbert Plumer's. "}, "Between the world wars": {"1920s": "[0] is our person to focus on. After the First World War, [0] commanded the 17th (Service) Battalion of the Royal Fusiliers, a battalion in the British Army of the Rhine, before reverting to [0]'s substantive rank of captain (brevet major) in November 1919. [0] had not at first been selected for the Staff College in Camberley, Surrey (his only hope of ever achieving high command). But at a tennis party in Cologne, [0] was able to persuade the Commander-in-chief (C-in-C) of the British Army of Occupation, Field Marshal Sir William Robertson, to add [0]'s name to the list.After graduating from the Staff College in Camberley, Surrey (his only hope of ever achieving high command), [0] was appointed brigade major in the 17th Infantry Brigade in January 1921. the 17th Infantry Brigade was stationed in County Cork, Ireland, carrying out counter-guerilla operations during the final stages of the Irish War of Independence.[0] came to the conclusion that the Irish War of Independence could not be won without harsh measures, and that self-government for Ireland was the only feasible solution; in 1923, after the establishment of Ireland and during the Irish Civil War, [0] wrote to Colonel Arthur Ernest Percival of the Essex Regiment:Personally, [0]'s whole attention was given to defeating the rebels but it never bothered [0] a bit how many houses were burnt. [0] think [0] regarded all civilians as 'Shinners' and [0] never had any dealings with any of all civilians. [0]'s own view is that to win a war of this sort, you must be ruthless. Oliver Cromwell, or the Germans, would have settled the Irish War of Independence in a very short time. Nowadays public opinion precludes such methods, Ireland would never allow such methods, and the politicians would lose the politicians's jobs if the politicians sanctioned such methods. That being so, [0] consider that Lloyd George was right in what Lloyd George did, if we had gone on we could probably have squashed the rebels as a temporary measure, but the rebels would have broken out again like an ulcer the moment we removed the troops. [0] think the rebels would probably [have] refused battles, and hidden the rebels's arms etc. until we had gone. In one noteworthy incident on 2 May 1922, [0] led a force of 60 soldiers and 4 armoured cars to the town of Macroom to search for four British officers who were missing in the area. While [0] had hoped the show of force would assist in finding four British officers who were missing in the area, [0] was under strict orders not to attack the IRA. On arriving in the town square in front of Macroom Castle, [0] summoned the IRA commander, Charlie Browne, to parley. At the castle gates [0] spoke to the IRA commander, Charlie Browne explaining what would happen should four British officers who were missing in the area not be released. Once finished, the IRA commander, Charlie Browne responded with the IRA commander, Charlie Browne's own ultimatum to [0] to \"leave the town of Macroom within 10 minutes\". the IRA commander, Charlie Browne then turned heels and returned to Macroom Castle. At this point another the IRA officer, Pat O'Sullivan, whistled to [0] drawing [0]'s attention to scores of the IRA volunteers who had quietly taken up firing positions all around the town square in front of Macroom Castle\u2014surrounding Montgomery's forces. Realising [0]'s precarious position, [0] led Montgomery's forces out of the town of Macroom, led[0]'s . Unknown to [0] at this time, four British officers who were missing in the area had already been executed.In May 1923, [0] was posted to the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division, a Territorial Army (TA) formation. [0] returned to the 1st Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment in 1925 as a company commander and was promoted to major in July 1925. From January 1926 to January 1929 [0] served as Deputy Assistant Adjutant General at the Staff College, Camberley, in the temporary rank of lieutenant-colonel.", "Marriage and family": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 1925, in [0]'s first known courtship of a woman, [0] [0]'s proposed to a 17-year-old girl, Betty Anderson. [0]'s approach included drawing diagrams in the sand of how [0] would deploy [0]'s tanks and infantry in a future war, a contingency which seemed very remote at that time. a 17-year-old girl, Betty Anderson respected [0]'s ambition and single-mindedness but declined [0]'s .In 1927, [0] met and married Elizabeth (Betty) Carver, n\u00e9e Hobart. Elizabeth (Betty) Carver, n\u00e9e Hobart was the sister of the future Second World War commander Major-General Sir Percy Hobart. Elizabeth (Betty) Carver, n\u00e9e Hobart had two sons in their early teens, John and Dicktwo sons in their early teens, John and Dick's , from Elizabeth (Betty) Carver, n\u00e9e Hobart's first marriage to Oswald Carver. Dick later wrote that it had been \"a very brave thing\" for [0] to take on Elizabeth (Betty) Carver, n\u00e9e Hobart. [0]'s son, David, was born in August 1928.While on holiday in Burnham-on-Sea in 1937, Elizabeth (Betty) Carver, n\u00e9e Hobart suffered an insect bite which became infected, and Elizabeth (Betty) Carver, n\u00e9e Hobart died in [0]'s arms from septicaemia following amputation of Elizabeth (Betty) Carver, n\u00e9e Hobart's leg. died devastated [0], but [0] insisted on throwing [0] back into [0]'s work immediately after the funeral. [0]'s marriage had been extremely happy. Much of [0]'s correspondence with Elizabeth (Betty) Carver, n\u00e9e Hobart was destroyed when [0]'s quarters at Portsmouth were bombed during Second World War. After [0]'s , Dick wrote that Elizabeth (Betty) Carver, n\u00e9e Hobart had arguably done the country a favour by keeping [0]'s personal oddities\u2014[0]'s extreme single-mindedness, and [0]'s intolerance of and suspicion of the motives of others\u2014within reasonable bounds long enough for Dick to have a chance of attaining high command.Both of Montgomery's stepsons became army officers in the 1930s (Both of Montgomery's stepsons were serving in India at the time of Elizabeth (Betty) Carver, n\u00e9e Hobart's ), and Both of Montgomery's stepsons served in Second World War, each eventually attaining the rank of colonel. While serving as a GSO2 with Eighth Army, Dick was sent forward during the pursuit after El Alamein to help identify a new site for Eighth Army HQ. Dick was taken prisoner at Mersa Matruh on 7 November 1942. [0] wrote to [0]'s contacts in England asking that inquiries be made via the Red Cross as to where [0]'s was being held, and that parcels be sent to Dick. Like many British POWs, the most famous being General Richard O'Connor, Dick escaped in September 1943 during the brief hiatus between Italy's departure from Second World War and the German seizure of the country. Dick eventually reached British lines on 5 December 1943, to the delight of Dick's stepfather, who sent Dick home to Britain to recuperate.", "1930s": "Bernard Montgomery is our person to focus on. In [0] Montgomery was promoted to brevet lieutenant-colonel. [0] Montgomery returned to the 1st Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment again, as Commander of Headquarters Company; Montgomery went to the War Office to help write the Infantry Training Manual in mid-1929. In 1931 Montgomery was promoted to substantive lieutenant-colonel and became the Commanding officer (CO) of the 1st Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment and saw service in Palestine and British India. Montgomery was promoted to colonel in June 1934 (seniority from January 1932). Montgomery attended and was then recommended to become an instructor at the Indian Army Staff College (now the Pakistan Command and Staff College) in Quetta, British India.On completion of Montgomery's tour of duty in British India, Montgomery returned to Britain in June 1937 where Montgomery took command of the 9th Infantry Brigade with the temporary rank of brigadier. Montgomery's wife died 1937.In 1938, Montgomery organised an amphibious combined operations landing exercise that impressed the new C-in-C of Southern Command, General Sir Archibald Percival Wavell. Montgomery was promoted to major-general on 14 October 1938 and took command of the 8th Infantry Division in Palestine. In Palestine, Montgomery was involved in suppressing an Arab revolt which had broken out over opposition to Jewish emigration. Montgomery returned in July 1939 to Britain, suffering a serious illness on the way, to command the 3rd (Iron) Infantry Division. Reporting the suppression of an Arab revolt which had broken out over opposition to Jewish emigration in April 1939, Montgomery wrote, \"Montgomery shall be sorry to leave Palestine in many ways, as Montgomery have enjoyed the war out here\".", "": ""}, "Second World War": {"British Expeditionary Force": "Bernard Montgomery is our person to focus on. Britain declared war on Germany on 3 September 1939 and [0], together with [0]'s new General Officer Commanding (GOC), was deployed to France as part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), commanded by General Lord Gort. Shortly after [0]'s arrival overseas, Bernard Montgomery faced serious trouble from Bernard Montgomery's military superiors and the clergy for Bernard Montgomery's frank attitude regarding the sexual health of Bernard Montgomery's soldiers, but was defended from dismissal by his superior Alan Brooke, commander of II Corps, of which Montgomery's division formed a part. Bernard Montgomery had issued a circular on the prevention of venereal disease, worded in such \"obscene language\" that both the Church of England and Roman Catholic senior chaplains objected; his superior Alan Brooke, commander of II Corps, of which Montgomery's division formed a part told Bernard Montgomery that his superior Alan Brooke, commander of II Corps, of which Montgomery's division formed a part did not want any further errors of this kind, though deciding not to get Bernard Montgomery to formally withdraw a circular on the prevention of venereal disease, worded in such \"obscene language\" that both the Church of England and Roman Catholic senior chaplains objected as withdraw would remove any \"vestige of respect\" left for Bernard Montgomery.Although Montgomery's new command was a Regular Army formation, comprising the 7th (Guards), and the 8th and 9th Infantry Brigades along with supporting units, Bernard Montgomery was not impressed with Montgomery's new command's readiness for battle. As a result, while most of the rest of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), commanded by General Lord Gort set about preparing defences for an expected German attack sometime in the future, Bernard Montgomery began training [0] in offensive tactics, organising several exercises, each of which lasted for several days at a time. Mostly several exercises, each of which lasted for several days at a time revolved around [0] advancing towards an objective, often a river line, only to come under attack and forced to withdraw to another position, usually behind another river. several exercises, each of which lasted for several days at a time usually occurred at night with only very minimal lighting being allowed. By the spring of 1940 [0] had gained a reputation of being a very agile and flexible formation. By then the Allies had agreed to Plan D, where they would advance deep into Belgium and take up positions on the River Dyle by the time the German forces attacked. his superior Alan Brooke, commander of II Corps, of which Montgomery's division formed a part, was pessimistic about Plan D, where they would advance deep into Belgium and take up positions on the River Dyle by the time the German forces attacked but Bernard Montgomery, in contrast, was not concerned, believing that Bernard Montgomery and [0] would perform well regardless of the circumstances, particularly in a war of movement.Bernard Montgomery's training paid off when the Germans began the Germans's invasion of the Low Countries on 10 May 1940 and [0] advanced to [0]'s planned position, near the Belgian city of Louvain. Soon after arrival, [0] was fired on by members of the Belgian 10th Infantry Division who mistook them for German paratroopers; Bernard Montgomery resolved fired by approaching members of the Belgian 10th Infantry Division who mistook them for German paratroopers and offering to place Bernard Montgomery under Belgian command, although Bernard Montgomery took control when the Germans arrived. During this time Bernard Montgomery began to develop a particular habit, which Bernard Montgomery would keep throughout the war, of going to bed at 21:30 every night without fail and giving only a single order\u2014that Bernard Montgomery was not to be disturbed\u2014which was only very rarely disobeyed.[0] saw little action compared to many other units and formations in the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), commanded by General Lord Gort but, owing to the strict training methods of Bernard Montgomery[0] , [0] always managed to be in the right place at the right time, especially so during the retreat into France. By 27 May, when the Belgian Army on the left flank of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), commanded by General Lord Gort began to disintegrate, [0] achieved something very difficult, the movement at night from the right to the left of another division and only 2,000 yards behind it. something very difficult, the movement at night from the right to the left of another division and only 2,000 yards behind it was performed with great professionalism and occurred without any incidents and thereby filled a very vulnerable gap in the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), commanded by General Lord Gort's defensive line. On 29/30 May, as [0] moved into the Dunkirk bridgehead, Bernard Montgomery temporarily took over from his superior Alan Brooke, commander of II Corps, of which Montgomery's division formed a part, as GOC of II Corps, of which Montgomery's division formed a part for the final stages of the Dunkirk evacuation.[0], returned to Britain intact with minimal casualties. Operation Dynamo\u2014codename for the Dunkirk evacuation\u2014saw 330,000 Allied military personnel, including most of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), commanded by General Lord Gort, to Britain, although the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), commanded by General Lord Gort was forced to leave behind a significant amount of equipment.", "Service in the United Kingdom 1940\u22121942": "[0] is our person to focus on. On [0]'s return [0] antagonised the War Office with trenchant criticisms of the command of the BEF and was briefly relegated to divisional command of 3rd Division, which was the only fully equipped division in Britain.

Models of the neutral Portuguese Azores were prepared and detailed plans worked out for invade. detailed plans did not go ahead and plans switched to invading Cape Verde island also belonging to neutral Portugal. plans also did not go ahead. [0] was then ordered to prepare plans for the invasion of neutral Ireland and to seize Cork, Cobh and Cork harbour. plans for the invasion of neutral Ireland and to seize Cork, Cobh and Cork harbour, like detailed plansthe neutral Portuguese Azores, also did not go ahead and in July 1940, [0] was appointed acting lieutenant-general and after handing over command of 3rd Division, which was the only fully equipped division in Britain to James Gammell, [0] was placed in command of V Corps, responsible for the defence of Hampshire and Dorset and started a long-running feud with the new Commander-in-chief (C-in-C) of Southern Command, Lieutenant-General Claude Auchinleck.In April 1941, [0] became commander of XII Corps responsible for the defence of Kent. During this period [0] instituted a regime of continuous training and insisted on high levels of physical fitness for both officers and other ranks.

In December [0] was given command of South-Eastern Command [0] renamed South-Eastern Command the South-Eastern Army to promote offensive spirit. During this time [0] further developed and rehearsed [0]'s ideas and trained [0]'s soldiers, culminating in Exercise Tiger in May 1942, a combined forces exercise involving 100,000 troops.", "North Africa and Italy": "Bernard Montgomery is our person to focus on. In 1942, a new field commander was required in the Middle East, where [0] was fulfilling both the role of Commander-in-chief (C-in-C) of Middle East Command and commander Eighth Army. [0] had stabilised the Allied position at the First Battle of El Alamein, but after a visit in August 1942, the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, replaced [0] as C-in-C with General Sir Harold Alexander and William Gott as commander of Eighth Army. However, after William Gott was killed flying back to Cairo, the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill was persuaded by Brooke, who by this time was Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS), to appoint Bernard Montgomery General Sir Harold Alexanderas commander of the British First Army for Operation Torch, the invasion of French North Africa.A story, probably apocryphal but popular at the time, is that appoint caused Bernard Montgomery to remark that \"After having an easy war, things have now got much more difficult.\" A colleague is supposed to have told Bernard Montgomery to cheer up\u2014at which point Bernard Montgomery said \"Bernard Montgomery'm not talking about Bernard Montgomery, Bernard Montgomery'm talking about Bernard Montgomery's assumption of command transformed the fighting spirit and abilities of Eighth Army. Taking command on 13 August 1942, Bernard Montgomery immediately became a whirlwind of activity. Bernard Montgomery ordered the creation of the X Corps, which contained all armoured divisions, to fight alongside Bernard Montgomery's XXX Corps, which was all infantry divisions. This arrangement differed from the German Panzer Corps: one of the German Panzer Corps combined infantry, armour and artillery units under one corps commander. The only common commander for Bernard Montgomery's all-infantry and all-armour corps was the Eighth Army Commander himselfthe Eighth Army Commander himself. Writing post-war the English historian Correlli Barnett commented that Montgomery's solution \"...\u00a0was in every way opposite to [0]'s and in every way wrong, for Montgomery's solution carried the existing dangerous separatism still further.\" Bernard Montgomery reinforced the 30 miles (48\u00a0km) long front line at El, something that would take two months to accomplish. Bernard Montgomery asked General Sir Harold Alexander to send Bernard Montgomery two new British divisions (51st Highland and 44th Home Counties) that were then arriving in Egypt and were scheduled to be deployed in defence of the Nile Delta. Bernard Montgomery moved Bernard Montgomery's field HQ to Burg al Arab, close to the Air Force command post in order to better coordinate combined operations.Bernard Montgomery was determined that the army, navy and air forces should fight the army, navy and air forces's battles in a unified, focused manner according to a detailed plan. Bernard Montgomery ordered immediate reinforcement of the vital heights of Alam Halfa, just behind his own lines, expecting the German commander, Erwin Rommel, to attack with the vital heights of Alam Halfa, just behind his own lines as the German commander, Erwin Rommel,'s objective, attackthe German commander, Erwin Rommel, . Bernard Montgomery ordered all contingency plans for retreat to be destroyed. \"Bernard Montgomery have cancelled the plan for withdrawal. If we are attacked, then there will be no retreat. If we cannot stay here alive, then we will stay here dead\", Bernard Montgomery told his officers at the first meeting Bernard Montgomery held with his officers in the desert, though, in fact, [0] had no plans to withdraw from the strong defensive position [0] had chosen and established at El.Bernard Montgomery made a great effort to appear before troops as often as possible, frequently visiting various units and making Bernard Montgomery known to the men, often arranging for cigarettes to be distributed. Although Bernard Montgomery still wore a standard British officer's cap on arrival in the desert, Bernard Montgomery briefly wore an Australian broad-brimmed hat before switching to wearing the black beret (with the badge of the Royal Tank Regiment and the British General Officer's cap badge) for which he became notable. the black beret (with the badge of the Royal Tank Regiment and the British General Officer's cap badge) for which he became notable was offered to Bernard Montgomery by Jim Fraser while Jim Fraser was driving Bernard Montgomery on an inspection tour. Both Brooke and Alexander were astonished by the transformation in atmosphere when Both Brooke and Alexander visited on 19 August, less than a week after Bernard Montgomery had taken command.Alanbrooke said that Churchill was always impatient for Churchill's generals to attack at once, and Alanbrooke wrote that Bernard Montgomery was always \"Alanbrooke's Monty\" when Bernard Montgomery was out of favour with Churchill! Eden had some late night drinks with Churchill, and Eden said at a meeting of the Chiefs of Staff the next day (29 October 1942) that the Middle East offensive was \"petering out\". Alanbrooke had told Churchill \"fairly plainly\" what Alanbrooke thought of Eden's ability to judge the tactical situation from a distance, and was supported at the Chiefs of Staff meeting by Smuts.Rommel's attempted to turn the left flank of Eighth Army at the Battle of Alam el Halfa from 31 August 1942. The German/Italian armoured corps infantry attack was stopped in very heavy fighting. Rommel's forces had to withdraw urgently lest Rommel's forces's retreat through the British minefields be cut off. Bernard Montgomery was criticised for not counter-attacking Rommel's forces immediately, but Bernard Montgomery felt strongly that Bernard Montgomery's methodical build-up of British forces was not yet ready. A hasty counter-attack risked ruining Bernard Montgomery's strategy for an offensive on his own terms in late October, planning for which had begun soon after Bernard Montgomery took command. Bernard Montgomery was confirmed in the permanent rank of lieutenant-general in mid-October.The conquest of Libya was essential for airfields to support Malta and to threaten the rear of Axis forces opposing Operation Torch, the invasion of French North Africa. Bernard Montgomery prepared meticulously for an offensive on his own terms in late October after convincing Churchill that the time was not being wasted. (Churchill sent a telegram to General Sir Harold Alexander on 23 September 1942 which began, \"We are in General Sir Harold Alexander's hands and of course a victorious battle makes amends for much delay.\") Bernard Montgomery was determined not to fight until Bernard Montgomery thought there had been sufficient preparation for a decisive victory, and put into action Bernard Montgomery's beliefs with the gathering of resources, detailed planning, the training of troops\u2014especially in clearing minefields and fighting at night\u2014and in the use of 252 of the latest American-built Sherman tanks, 90 M7 Priest self-propelled howitzers, and making a personal visit to every unit involved in an offensive on his own terms in late October. By the time an offensive on his own terms in late October was ready in late October, Eighth Army had 231,000 men on Eighth Army's ration strength.The Second Battle of El Alamein began on 23 October 1942, and ended 12 days later with one of the first large-scale, decisive Allied land victories of the war. Bernard Montgomery correctly predicted both the length of The Second Battle of El Alamein and the number of casualties (13,500).Historian Correlli Barnett has pointed out that the rain also fell on the Germans, and that the weather is therefore an inadequate explanation for the failure to exploit one of the first large-scale, decisive Allied land victories of the war, but nevertheless The Second Battle of El Alamein had been a great success. Over 30,000 prisoners of war were taken, including the German second-in-command, General von Thoma, as well as eight other general officers. Rommel's, having been in a hospital in Germany at the start of The Second Battle of El Alamein, was forced to return on 25 October 1942 after Stumme\u2014Rommel's's replacement as German commander\u2014died of a heart attack in the early hours of The Second Battle of El Alamein.Bernard Montgomery was advanced to KCB and promoted to full general. Bernard Montgomery kept the initiative, applying superior strength when superior strength suited Bernard Montgomery, forcing Rommel's out of each successive defensive position. On 6 March 1943, Rommel's's attack on Eighth Army at Medenine (Operation Capri) with the largest concentration of German armour in French North Africa was successfully repulsed. At the Mareth Line, 20 to 27 March, when Bernard Montgomery encountered fiercer frontal opposition than Bernard Montgomery had anticipated, Bernard Montgomery switched Bernard Montgomery's major effort into an outflanking inland pincer, backed by low-flying RAF fighter-bomber support. For Bernard Montgomery's role in French North Africa Bernard Montgomery was awarded the Legion of Merit by the United States government in the rank of Chief Commander.The next major Allied attack was the Allied invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky). Bernard Montgomery considered the initial plans for the Allied invasion, which had been agreed in principle by General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander Allied Forces Headquarters, and General Alexander, the 15th Army Group commander, to be unworkable because of the dispersion of effort. Bernard Montgomery managed to have the plans recast to concentrate the Allied forces, having Lieutenant General George Patton's's US Seventh Army land in the Gulf of Gela (on Eighth Army's left flank, which landed around Syracuse in the south-east of Sicily) rather than near Palermo in the west and north of Sicily. Inter-Allied tensions grew as the American commanders, Patton and Omar Bradley (then commanding US II Corps under Patton), took umbrage at what the American commanders, Patton and Omar Bradley (then commanding US II Corps under Patton) saw as Bernard Montgomery's attitudes and boastfulness. However, while the American commanders, Patton and Omar Bradley (then commanding US II Corps under Patton) were considered three of the greatest soldiers of the American commanders, Patton and Omar Bradley (then commanding US II Corps under Patton)'s time, due to the American commanders, Patton and Omar Bradley (then commanding US II Corps under Patton)'s competitiveness the American commanders, Patton and Omar Bradley (then commanding US II Corps under Patton) were renowned for \"squabbling like three schoolgirls\" thanks to the American commanders, Patton and Omar Bradley (then commanding US II Corps under Patton)'s \"bitchiness\", \"whining to the American commanders, Patton and Omar Bradley (then commanding US II Corps under Patton)'s superiors\" and \"showing off\".Bernard Montgomery's was then majorly involved in the Allied invasion of Italy in early September 1943, becoming the first of the Allied forces to land in Western Europe. Led mainly by Lieutenant General Sir Miles Dempsey's XIII Corps on 3 September, four years since the British entrance into the war, Eighth Army landed on the toe of Italy in Operation Baytown, encountering little enemy resistance. The Germans had made the decision to fall back and did what The Germans could to stall Eighth Army's advance, including blowing up bridges, laying mines, and setting up booby-traps, all of which made Eighth Army's ability to work Eighth Army's way up through Italy, was very slow, for which Bernard Montgomery later received much criticism. On 9 September the British 1st Airborne Division landed at the key port of Taranto in the heel of Italy as part of Operation Slapstick, capturing the key port of Taranto in the heel of Italy and, like with Operation Baytown, encountering no resistance. On 9 September the U.S. Fifth Army under Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark (which actually contained a large number of British troops) landed at Salerno, near Naples, as part of Operation Avalanche but soon found the U.S. Fifth Army under Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark (which actually contained a large number of British troops) fighting for the U.S. Fifth Army under Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark (which actually contained a large number of British troops)'s very existence with The Germans launching several determined counterattacks to try and push the Allies back into the sea, with Bernard Montgomery's men being too far away to provide any real assistance. The situation was tense over the next few days but the two armies (both of which formed the 15th Army Group under General Sir Harold Alexander) finally began to meet on 16 September, by which time the crisis at Salerno, near Naples was virtually over.the U.S. Fifth Army under Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark (which actually contained a large number of British troops) then began to advance to the west of the Apennine Mountains while Bernard Montgomery, with Lieutenant General Charles Allfrey's V Corps having arrived to reinforce Lieutenant General Sir Miles Dempsey's XIII Corps, advanced to the east. The Foggia airfields soon fell to Lieutenant General Charles Allfrey's V Corps, but The Germans fought hard in the defence of Termoli and Biferno. Movement soon came to an almost complete halt in the early part of November when Eighth Army came up against a new defensive line established by The Germans on the River Sangro, which was to be the scene of much bitter and heavy fighting  for the next month. While some ground was gained, some ground was often at the expense of heavy casualties and The Germans always managed to retreat to new defensive positions.Bernard Montgomery abhorred what Bernard Montgomery considered to be a lack of coordination, a dispersion of effort, a strategic muddle and a lack of opportunism in the Allied campaign in Italy, describing the whole affair as a \"dog's breakfast\".", "Normandy": "[0] is our person to focus on. As a result of [0]'s dissatisfaction with Italy, [0] was delighted to receive the news that [0] was to return to Britain in January 1944. [0] was assigned to command the 21st Army Group consisting of all Allied ground forces participating in Operation Overlord, codename for the Allied invasion of Normandy. Overall direction was assigned to the Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces, American General Dwight D. Eisenhower. Both Churchill and Eisenhower the Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces, American General Dwight D. Eisenhower had found [0] difficult to work with in the past and wanted command to go to the more affable General Sir Harold Alexander. However Montgomery's patron, General Sir Alan Brooke, firmly argued that [0] was a much superior general to the more affable General Sir Harold Alexander and ensured [0]'s appointment. Without Montgomery's patron, General Sir Alan Brooke's support, [0] would have remained in Italy. At St Paul's School on 7 April and 15 May [0] presented his strategy for the invasion. [0] envisaged a ninety-day battle, with all forces reaching the Seine. the Allied invasion of Normandy would pivot on an Allied-held Caen in the east of the Normandy bridgehead, with relatively static British and Canadian armies forming a shoulder to attract and defeat German counter-attacks, relieving the US armies who would move and seize the Cotentin Peninsula and Brittany, wheeling south and then east on the right forming a pincer.During the ten weeks of the Battle of Normandy, unfavourable autumnal weather conditions disrupted the Normandy landing areas. [0]'s initial plan was for the Anglo-Canadian troops under his command to break out immediately from the Anglo-Canadian troops under his command's beachheads on the Calvados coast towards Caen with the aim of taking Caen on either D Day or two days later. [0] attempted to take Caen with the 3rd Infantry Division, 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division and the 3rd Canadian Division but was stopped from 6\u20138 June by 21st Panzer Division and 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend, who hit the Anglo-Canadian troops under his command very hard. Rommel followed up stopped by ordering 12th SS Panzer Division to Caen while Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt asked for and received permission from Hitler to have the elite 1st Waffen SS Division Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler and 2nd Waffen SS Division Das Reich sent to Caen as well. [0] thus had to face what Stephen Badsey called the \"most formidable\" of all the German divisions in France. The 12th Waffen SS Division Hitlerjugend, as The 12th Waffen SS Division Hitlerjugend's name implies, was drawn entirely from the more fanatical elements of the Hitler Youth and commanded by the ruthless SS-Brigadef\u00fchrer Kurt Meyer, aka \"Panzer Meyer\".The failure to take Caen immediately has been the source of an immense historiographical dispute with bitter nationalist overtones. Broadly, there has been a \"British school\" which accepts [0]'s post-war claim that [0] never intended to take Caen at once, and instead the Anglo-Canadian operations around Caen were a \"holding operation\" intended to attract the bulk of the German forces towards the Caen sector to allow the Americans to stage the \"break out operation\" on the left flank of the German positions, which was all part of [0]'s \"Master Plan\" that [0] had conceived long before the Allied invasion of Normandy. By contrast, the \"American school\" argued that Montgomery's initial \"master plan\" was for the 21st Army Group to take Caen at once and move [0]'s tank divisions into the plains south of Caen, to then stage a breakout that would lead the 21st Army Group into the plains south of Caen and hence into Antwerp and finally the Ruhr. Letters written by the Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces, American General Dwight D. Eisenhower at the time of the Battle of Normandy make it clear that the Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces, American General Dwight D. Eisenhower was expecting from [0] \"the early capture of CaenCaen\". Later, when this plan had clearly failed, the Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces, American General Dwight D. Eisenhower wrote that [0] had \"evolved\" the plan to have the Americans achieve the break-out instead.As the Allied invasion of Normandy progressed, [0] altered Montgomery's initial \"master plan\" and continued the strategy of attracting and holding German counter-attacks in the area north of Caen rather than to the south, to allow the U.S. First Army in the west to take Cherbourg. A memo summarising [0]'s operations written by the Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces, American General Dwight D. Eisenhower's chief of staff, General Walter Bedell Smith who met with [0] in late June 1944 says nothing about [0] conducting a \"holding operation\" in the Caen sector, and instead speaks of [0] seeking a \"breakout\" into the plains south of the Seine. On 12 June, [0] ordered the 7th Armoured Division into an attack against the Panzer Lehr Division that made good progress at first but ended when the Panzer Lehr Division was joined by the 2nd Panzer Division. At Villers Bocage on 14 June, the British lost twenty Cromwell tanks to five Tiger tanks led by SS Obersturmf\u00fchrer Michael Wittmann, in about five minutes. Despite lostVillers Bocage, [0] was still optimistic as the Allies were landing more troops and supplies than the Allies were losing in battle, and though the German lines were holding, the Wehrmacht and Waffen SS were suffering considerable attrition. Air Marshal Sir Arthur Tedder complained that it was impossible to move fighter squadrons to France until [0] had captured some airfields, something Air Marshal Sir Arthur Tedder asserted that [0] appeared incapable of doing. The first V-1 flying bomb attacks on London, which started on 13 June, further increased the pressure on [0] from Whitehall to speed up [0]'s advance.On 18 June, [0] ordered Bradley to take Cherbourg while the British were to take Caen by 23 June. In Operation Epsom, the British VII Corps commanded by Sir Richard O'Connor attempted to outflank Caen from the west by breaking through the dividing line between the Panzer Lehr Division and 12th SS Panzer Division to take the strategic Hill 112. Operation Epsom began well with Sir Richard O'Connor's assault force (the British 15th Scottish Division) breaking through and with the 11th Armoured Division stopping the counter-attacks of 12th SS Panzer Division. General Friedrich Dollmann of Seventh Army had to commit the newly arrived II SS Corps to stop the British offensive. Dollmann, fearing that Operation Epsom would be a success, committed suicide and was replaced by SS Oberstegruppenf\u00fchrer Paul Hausser. Sir Richard O'Connor, at the cost of about 4,000 men, had won a salient 5 miles (8.0\u00a0km) deep and 2 miles (3.2\u00a0km) wide but placed the Germans into an unviable long-term position. There was a strong sense of crisis in the Allied command, as the Allies had advanced only about 15 miles (24\u00a0km) inland, at a time when the Allies's plans called for the Allies to have already taken Rennes, Alen\u00e7on and St. Malo. After Operation Epsom, [0] had to tell General Harry Crerar that the activation of the First Canadian Army would have to wait as there was only room at present, in the Caen sector, for the newly arrived XII Corps under Lieutenant-General Neil Ritchie, which caused some tension with General Harry Crerar. Operation Epsom had forced further German forces into Caen but all through June and the first half of July Rommel, Rundstedt, and Hitler were engaged in planning for a great offensive to drive the British into the sea; a great offensive to drive the British into the sea was never launched and would have required the commitment of a large number of German forces to the Caen sector.It was only after several failed attempts to break out in the Caen sector that [0] devised what [0] later called [0]'s \"master plan\" of having the 21st Army Group hold the bulk of the German forces, thus allowing the Americans to break out. The Canadian historians Terry Copp and Robert Vogel wrote about the dispute between the \"American school\" and \"British school\" after having suffered several setbacks in June:[0] drew what was the indisputably correct conclusion from these events. If the British and Canadians could continue to hold the bulk of the German armoured divisions on the British and Canadians's front through a series of limited attacks, the British and Canadians could wear down the Germans and create the conditions for an American breakout on the right.This is what [0] proposed in his Directive of June 30th and, if [0] and [0]'s admirers had let the record speak for the record, there would be little debate about [0]'s conduct of the first stages of the Allied invasion of Normandy. Instead, [0] insisted that his Directive of June 30th was a consistent part of a master plan that [0] had devised long before the Allied invasion of Normandy. Curiously, this view does a great disservice to [0] for any rigid planning of operations before the German response was known would have been bad generalship indeed!\" Hampered by stormy weather and the bocage terrain, [0] had to ensure that Rommel focused on the British in the east rather than the Americans in the west, who had to take the Cotentin Peninsula and Brittany before the Germans could be trapped by a general swing east. [0] told General Sir Miles Dempsey, the commander of Second British Army: \"Go on hitting, drawing the German strength, especially some of the armour, onto General Sir Miles Dempsey, the commander of Second British Army\u2014so as to ease the way for Bradley.\" the Germans had deployed twelve divisions, of which six were Panzer divisions, against the British while deploying eight divisions, of which three were Panzer divisions, against the Americans. By the middle of July Caen had not been taken, as Rommel continued to prioritise prevention of the break-out by British forces rather than the western territories being taken by the Americans. This was broadly as [0] had planned, albeit not with the same speed as [0] outlined at St Paul's, although as the American historian Carlo D'Este pointed out the actual situation in Normandy was \"vastly different\" from what was envisioned at the St. Paul's conference, as only one of four goals outlined in May had been achieved by 10 July.On 7 July, [0] began Operation Charnwood with a carpet bombing offensive that turned much of the French countryside and Caen into a wasteland. The British and Canadians succeeded in advancing into northern France before the Germans, who used the ruins to their advantage and stopped the British offensive. On 10 July, [0] ordered Bradley to take Avranches, after which U.S. Third Army would be activated to drive towards Le Mans and Alen\u00e7on. On 14 July 1944, [0] wrote to Montgomery's patron, General Sir Alan Brooke, saying [0] had chosen on a \"real show down on the eastern flanks, and to loose a Corps of three armoured divisions in the open country about the Caen-Falaise road\u00a0... The possibilities are immense; with seven hundred tanks loosed to the South-east of Caen, and the armoured cars operating far ahead, anything can happen.\" The French Resistance had launched Plan Violet in June 1944 to systematically destroy the telephone system of France, which forced the Germans to use the Germans's radios more and more to communicate, and as the code-breakers of Bletchley Park had broken many of the German codes, [0] had, thanks to \"Ultra\" intelligence, a good idea of the German situation. [0] thus knew German Army Group B had lost 96,400 men while receiving 5,200 replacements and the Panzer Lehr Division now based at St. L\u00f4 was down to only 40 tanks. [0] later wrote that [0] knew [0] had the Normandy campaign won at this point as the Germans had almost no reserves while [0] had a Corps of three armoured divisions in reserve.An American break-out was achieved with Operation Cobra and the encirclement of German forces in the Falaise pocket at the cost of British losses with the diversionary Operation Goodwood. On the early morning of 18 July 1944, the diversionary Operation Goodwood began with British heavy bombers beginning carpet bombing attacks that further devastated what was left of Caen and the surrounding countryside. A British tank crewman from the Guards Armoured Division later recalled: \"At 0500 hours a distant thunder in the air brought all the sleepy-eyed tank crews out of all the sleepy-eyed tank crews's blankets. 1,000 Lancasters were flying from the sea in groups of three or four at 3,000 feet (910\u00a0m). Ahead of 1,000 Lancasters the pathfinders were scattering the pathfinders's flares and before long the first bombs were dropping.\" A German tankman from the 21st Panzer Division at the receiving end of this bombardment remembered: \"We saw little dots detach little dots from the planes, so many of little dots that the crazy thought occurred to We: are little dots leaflets?\u00a0... Among the thunder of the explosions, We could hear the wounded scream and the insane howling of men who had [been] driven mad.\" The British bombing had badly smashed the German front-line units; e.g., tanks were thrown up on the roofs of French farmhouses. Initially, the three British armoured divisions assigned to lead the offensive, the 7th, 11th and the Guards, made rapid progress and were soon approaching the Borguebus ridge, which dominated the landscape south of Caen, by noon.If the three British armoured divisions assigned to lead the offensive, the 7th, 11th and the Guards could take the Borguebus ridge, which dominated the landscape south of Caen,, the way to the plains south of Caen would be wide open, and potentially Paris could be taken, which explains the ferocity with which the Germans defended the Borguebus ridge, which dominated the landscape south of Caen,. One German officer, Lieutenant Baron von Rosen, recalled that to motivate a Luftwaffe officer commanding a battery of four 88\u00a0mm guns to fight against the British tanks, One German officer, Lieutenant Baron von Rosen had to hold One German officer, Lieutenant Baron von Rosen's handgun to a Luftwaffe officer commanding a battery of four 88\u00a0mm guns's head \"and asked a Luftwaffe officer commanding a battery of four 88\u00a0mm guns whether a Luftwaffe officer commanding a battery of four 88\u00a0mm guns would like to be killed immediately or get a high decoration. One German officer, Lieutenant Baron von Rosen decided for a high decoration.\" The well dug-in 88\u00a0mm guns around the Borguebus ridge, which dominated the landscape south of Caen, began taking a toll on the British Sherman tanks, and the countryside was soon dotted with dozens of burning Shermans. One British officer reported with worry: \"One British officer see palls of smoke and tanks brewing up with flames belching forth from tanks's turrets. One British officer see men climbing out, on fire like torches, rolling on the ground to try and douse the flames.\" Despite [0]'s orders to try to press on, fierce German counter-attacks stopped the British offensive.The objectives of the diversionary Operation Goodwood were all achieved except the complete capture of the Bourgebus Ridge, which was only partially taken. the diversionary Operation Goodwood was a strategic Allied success in drawing in the last German reserves in Normandy towards the Caen sector away from the American sector, greatly assisting the American breakout in Operation Cobra. By the end of the diversionary Operation Goodwood on 25 July 1944, the Canadians had finally taken Caen while the British Sherman tanks had reached the plains south of Caen, giving [0] the \"hinge\" [0] had been seeking, while forcing the Germans to commit the last of the Germans's reserves to stop the British offensive. \"Ultra\" decrypts indicated that the Germans now facing Bradley were seriously understrength, with Operation Cobra about to commence. During the diversionary Operation Goodwood, the British had 400 tanks knocked out, with many recovered returning to service. The casualties were 5,500 with 7 miles (11\u00a0km) of ground gained. Bradley recognised Montgomery's plan to pin down German armour and allow U.S. forces to break out:The British and Canadian armies were to decoy the enemy reserves and draw the enemy reserves to the enemy reserves's front on the extreme eastern edge of the Allied beachhead. Thus, while [0] taunted the enemy at Caen, we [the Americans] were to make we [the Americans]'s break on the long roundabout road to Paris. When reckoned in terms of national pride, decoy became a sacrificial one, for while we [the Americans] tramped around the outside flank, the British were to sit in place and pin down the Germans. Yet strategically decoy fitted into a logical division of labors, for it was towards Caen that the enemy reserves would race once the alarm was sounded. The long-running dispute over what [0]'s \"master plan\" in Normandy led historians to differ greatly about the purpose of Goodwood. The British journalist Mark Urban wrote that the purpose of Goodwood was to draw German troops to German troops's left flank to allow U.S. forces to break out on the right flank, arguing that [0] had to lie to his soldiers about the purpose of Goodwood, as the average British soldier would not have understood why the average British soldier were being asked to create a diversion to allow the Americans to have the glory of staging break with Operation Cobra. By contrast, the American historian Stephen Power argued that the diversionary Operation Goodwood was intended to be the \"breakout\" offensive and not a \"holding operation\", writing: \"It is unrealistic to assert that an operation which called for the use of 4,500 Allied aircraft, 700 artillery pieces and over 8,000 armored vehicles and trucks and that cost the British over 5,500 casualties was conceived and executed for so limited an objective.\" the American historian Stephen Power noted that the diversionary Operation Goodwood were supposed to take effect on the same day, 18 July 1944, but Operation Cobra was cancelled owing to heavy rain in the American sector, and argued that Goodwood and Cobra were meant to be breakout operations to trap the German armies in Normandy. American military writer Drew Middleton wrote that there is no doubt that [0] wanted the diversionary Operation Goodwood to provide a \"shield\" for Bradley, but at the same time [0] was clearly hoping for more than merely diverting German attention away from the American sector. British historian John Keegan pointed out that [0] made differing statements before the diversionary Operation Goodwood about the purpose of the diversionary Operation Goodwood. British historian John Keegan wrote that [0] engaged in what [0] called a \"hedging of [0]'s bets\" when drafting [0]'s plans for the diversionary Operation Goodwood, with a plan for a \"break out if the front collapsed, if not, sound documentary evidence that all [0] had intended in the first place was a battle of attrition\". Again Bradley confirmed Montgomery's plan to pin down German armour and allow U.S. forces to break out and that the capture of Caen was only incidental to Bradley's mission, not critical. The American magazine LIFE quoted Bradley in 1951:While Collins was hoisting Collins's VII Corps flag over Cherbourg, [0] was spending [0]'s reputation in a bitter siege against Caen. For three weeks [0] had rammed [0]'s troops against those panzer divisions [0] had deliberately drawn towards Caen as part of our Allied strategy of diversion in the Allied invasion of Normandy. Although Caen contained an important road junction that [0] would eventually need, for the moment the capture of Caen was only incidental to [0]'s mission. For [0]'s primary task was to attract German troops to the British front that we might more easily secure Cherbourg and get into position for break.While this diversion of [0]'s was brilliantly achieved, [0] nevertheless left [0] open to criticism by overemphasising the importance of [0]'s thrust toward Caen. Had [0] limited [0] simply to the containment without making Caen a symbol of the containment, [0] would have been credited with success instead of being charged, as [0] was, with failure. With the diversionary Operation Goodwood drawing the Wehrmacht towards the Caen sector, Seventh Army enjoyed a two-to-one numerical superiority. Bradley accepted [0]'s advice to begin the British offensive by concentrating at one point instead of a \"broad front\" as the Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces, American General Dwight D. Eisenhower would have preferred.the diversionary Operation Goodwood almost cost [0] [0]'s job, as the Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces, American General Dwight D. Eisenhower seriously considered sacking [0] and only chose not to do so because to sack [0] would have caused such a political backlash in Britain against the Americans at a critical moment in the war that the resulting strains in the Atlantic alliance were not considered worth it. [0] expressed [0]'s satisfaction at the results of the diversionary Operation Goodwood when calling the diversionary Operation Goodwood off. the Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces, American General Dwight D. Eisenhower was under the impression that the diversionary Operation Goodwood was to be a break-out operation. Either there was a miscommunication between the two men or the Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces, American General Dwight D. Eisenhower did not understand the strategy. Alan Brooke, chief of the British Imperial General Staff, wrote: \"[0] knows nothing about strategy and is quite unsuited to command. It is no wonder that [0]'s real high ability is not always realised.\" Bradley fully understood [0]'s intentions. the two men would not give away to the press the true intentions of the two men's .Many American officers had found [0] a difficult man to work with, and after the diversionary Operation Goodwood, pressured the Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces, American General Dwight D. Eisenhower to fire [0]. Although the the Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces, American General Dwight D. Eisenhower\u2013[0] dispute is sometimes depicted in nationalist terms as being an Anglo-American struggle, it was the British Air Marshal Arthur Tedder who was pressing the Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces, American General Dwight D. Eisenhower most strongly after the diversionary Operation Goodwood to fire [0]. An American officer wrote in An American officer's diary that the British Air Marshal Arthur Tedder had come to see the Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces, American General Dwight D. Eisenhower to \"pursue the British Air Marshal Arthur Tedder's current favourite subject, the sacking of [0]\". With the British Air Marshal Arthur Tedder leading the \"sack Monty\" campaign, the \"sack Monty\" campaign encouraged [0]'s American enemies to press the Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces, American General Dwight D. Eisenhower to fire [0]. Alan Brooke, chief of the British Imperial General Staff was sufficiently worried about the \"sack Monty\" campaign to visit [0] at his Tactical Headquarters (TAC) in France and as Alan Brooke, chief of the British Imperial General Staff wrote in Alan Brooke, chief of the British Imperial General Staff's diary; \"warned [[0]] of a tendency in the PM [Churchill] to listen to suggestions that [0] played for safety and was not prepared to take risks\". Alan Brooke, chief of the British Imperial General Staff advised [0] to invite Churchill to Normandy, arguing that if the \"sack Monty\" campaign had won the Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces, American General Dwight D. Eisenhower over, then [0]'s career would be over, as having Churchill's backing would give the Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces, American General Dwight D. Eisenhower the political \"cover\" to fire [0]. On 20 July, [0] met the Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces, American General Dwight D. Eisenhower and on 21 July, Churchill, at his Tactical Headquarters (TAC) in France. One of [0]'s staff officers wrote afterwards that it was \"common knowledge at his Tactical Headquarters (TAC) in France that Churchill had come to sack [0]\". No notes were taken at metthe Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces, American General Dwight D. Eisenhower[0] [0] , but [0] was able to persuade Both Churchill and Eisenhower not to sack [0].With the success of Cobra, which was soon followed by unleashing U.S. Third Army commanded by General George S. Patton, the Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces, American General Dwight D. Eisenhower wrote to [0]: \"the Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces, American General Dwight D. Eisenhower delighted that his strategy for the invasion has begun brilliantly to unfold with Bradley's initial success.\" the success of Cobra, which was soon followed by unleashing U.S. Third Army commanded by General George S. Patton was aided by Operation Spring, when the II Canadian Corps under General Guy Simonds (the only Canadian general whose skill [0] respected) began an offensive south of Caen that made little headway, but which the Germans regarded as the main offensive. Once U.S. Third Army commanded by General George S. Patton arrived, Bradley was promoted to take command of the newly created 12th Army Group, consisting of U.S. First and Third Armies. Following the American breakout, there followed the Battle of Falaise Gap. British, Canadian, and Polish soldiers of 21st Army Group commanded by [0] advanced south, while the American and French soldiers of the newly created 12th Army Group, consisting of U.S. First and Third Armies advanced north to encircle the German Army Group B at Falaise, as [0] waged what The British journalist Mark Urban called \"a huge battle of annihilation\" in August 1944. [0] began [0]'s offensive into the Suisse Normande region with Operation Bluecoat, with Sir Richard O'Connor's VIII Corps and Gerard Bucknall's's XXX Corps heading south. [0] sacked Gerard Bucknall's for being insufficiently aggressive and replaced Gerard Bucknall's with General Brian Horrocks. At the same time, [0] ordered Patton\u2014whose Third Army was supposed to advance into Brittany\u2014to instead capture Nantes, which was soon taken.Hitler waited too long to order his soldiers to retreat from Normandy, leading [0] to write: \"Hitler refused to face the only sound military course. As a result the Allies caused the enemy staggering losses in men and materials.\" Knowing via \"Ultra\" that Hitler was not planning to retreat from Normandy, [0], on 6 August 1944, ordered an envelopment operation against German Army Group B\u2014with the First Canadian Army under Harry Crerar to advance towards Falaise, British Second Army under Miles Dempsey to advance towards Argentan, and U.S. Third Army commanded by General George S. Patton to advance to Alen\u00e7on. On 11 August, [0] changed his strategy for the invasion, with the First Canadian Army under Harry Crerar to take Falaise and to meet the Americans at Argentan. the First Canadian Army under Harry Crerar launched two operations, Operation Totalize on 7 August, which advanced only 9 miles (14\u00a0km) in four days in the face of fierce German resistance, and Operation Tractable on 14 August, which finally took Falaise on 17 August. In view of the slow Canadian advance, General George S. Patton requested permission to take Falaise, but was refused by Bradley on 13 June. refused prompted much controversy, many historians arguing that Bradley lacked aggression and that [0] should have overruled Bradley.The so-called Falaise Gap was closed on 22 August 1944, but several American generals, most notably General George S. Patton, accused [0] of being insufficiently aggressive in closing The so-called Falaise Gap. About 60,000 German soldiers were trapped in Normandy, but before 22 August 1944, about 20,000 Germans had escaped through The so-called Falaise Gap. About 10,000 Germans had been killed in the Battle of the Falaise Gap, which led a stunned Eisenhower, who viewed the battlefield on 24 August, to comment with horror that it was impossible to walk without stepping on corpses. The successful conclusion of the Allied invasion of Normandy saw the beginning of the debate between the \"American school\" and \"British school\" as both American and British generals started to advance claims about who was most responsible for the Battle of the Falaise Gap. Alan Brooke, chief of the British Imperial General Staff wrote in defence of Alan Brooke, chief of the British Imperial General Staff's : \"[0] knows nothing about strategy and is 'quite' unsuited to command. It is no wonder that [0]'s real high ability is not always realised. Especially so when 'national' spectacles pervert the perspective of the strategic landscape.\" About [0]'s conduct of the Allied invasion of Normandy, Stephen Badsey wrote:Too much discussion on Normandy has centered on the controversial decisions of the Allied commanders. It was not good enough, apparently, to win such a complete and spectacular victory over an enemy that had conquered most of Europe unless such a complete and spectacular victory over an enemy that had conquered most of Europe was done perfectly. Most of the blame for this lies with Montgomery, who was foolish enough to insist that such a complete and spectacular victory over an enemy that had conquered most of Europe had been done perfectly, that Normandy\u2014and all [0]'s other battles\u2014had been fought accordingly to a precise master plan drawn up beforehand, from which [0] never deviated. It says much for [0]'s personality that [0] found others to agree with [0], despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. [0]'s handling of Normandy was of a very high order, and as the person who would certainly have been blamed for losing Normandy, [0] deserves the credit for winning Normandy. ", "Replaced as Ground Forces Commander": "[0] is our person to focus on. General Eisenhower took over Ground Forces Command on 1 September, while continuing as Supreme Commander, with [0] continuing to command the 21st Army Group, now consisting mainly of British and Canadian units. [0] bitterly resented this change, although this change had been agreed before the D-Day invasion. The British journalist Mark Urban writes that [0] seemed unable to grasp that as the majority of the 2.2\u00a0million Allied soldiers fighting against Germany on the Western Front were now American (the ratio was 3:1) that it was politically unacceptable to American public opinion to have [0] remain as Land Forces Commander as: \"Politics would not allow [0] to carry on giving orders to great armies of Americans simply because, in [0]'s view, [0] was better than great armies of Americans's generals.\"Winston Churchill had [0] promoted to field marshal by way of compensation.", "Advance to the Rhine": "Bernard Montgomery is our person to focus on. By September, ports like Cherbourg were too far away from the front line, causing the Allies great logistical problems. [0] was the third largest port in Europe. [0] was a deep water inland port connected to the North Sea via the river Scheldt. the river Scheldt was wide enough and dredged deep enough to allow the passage of ocean-going ships.On 3 September 1944 Hitler ordered Fifteenth Army, which had been stationed in the Pas de Calais region and was withdrawing north into the Low Countries, to hold the mouth of the river Scheldt to deprive the Allies of the use of [0]. Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, the German commander of the Western Front, ordered General Gustav-Adolf von Zangen, the commander of Fifteenth Army, which had been stationed in the Pas de Calais region and was withdrawing north into the Low Countries, that: \"The attempt of the enemy to occupy the West Scheldt in order to obtain the free use of the harbor of Antwerp must be resisted to the utmost\" (emphasis in the original). Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, the German commander of the Western Front, argued with Hitler that as long as the Allies could not use [0], the Allies would lack the logistical capacity for an invasion of Germany.The Witte Brigade (White Brigade) of the Belgian resistance had captured [0] before the Germans could destroy key port facilities, and on 4 September, [0] was captured by Horrocks with the harbor of Antwerp mostly intact. Horrocks declined to immediately advance over the Albert Canal, and an opportunity to destroy Fifteenth Army, which had been stationed in the Pas de Calais region and was withdrawing north into the Low Countries was lost. the Germans had mined the river Scheldt, the mouth of the river Scheldt was still in German hands making it impossible for the Royal Navy to clear the mines in the river Scheldt, and therefore [0] was still useless to the Allies.On 5 September, SHAEF's naval commander, Admiral Sir Bertram Ramsay, had urged Bernard Montgomery to make clearing the mouth of the river Scheldt Bernard Montgomery's number-one priority. Alone among the senior commanders, SHAEF's naval commander, Admiral Sir Bertram Ramsay saw opening [0] as crucial. Thanks to \"Ultra,\" Bernard Montgomery was aware of 3 September 1944 Hitler ordered Fifteenth Army, which had been stationed in the Pas de Calais region and was withdrawing north into the Low Countries, by 5 September.On 9 September, Bernard Montgomery wrote to Brooke that \"one good Pas de Calais port\" would be sufficient to meet all the logistical needs of the 21st Army Group, but only the supply needs of the 21st Army Group. At the same time, Bernard Montgomery noted that \"one good Pas de Calais port\" would be insufficient for the American armies in France, which would thus force Brooke, if for no other reasons than logistics, to favour Bernard Montgomery's plans for an invasion of northern Germany by the 21st Army Group, whereas if [0] were opened up, then all of the Allied armies could be supplied.The importance of ports closer to Germany was highlighted with the liberation of the city of Le Havre, which was assigned to John Crocker's I Corps. To take the city of Le Havre, which was assigned to John Crocker's I Corps, two infantry divisions, two tank brigades, most of the artillery of the Second British Army, the specialised armoured \"gadgets\" of Percy Hobart's 79th Armoured Division, the battleship HMS\u00a0Warspite and the monitor HMS\u00a0Erebus were all committed. On 10 September 1944, Bomber Command dropped 4,719 tons of bombs on the city of Le Havre, which was assigned to John Crocker's I Corps, which was the prelude to Operation Astonia, the assault on the city of Le Havre, which was assigned to John Crocker's I Corps by John Crocker's's men, which was taken two days later. The Canadian historian Terry Copp wrote that the commitment of this much firepower and men to take only one French city might \"seem excessive\", but by this point, the Allies desperately needed ports closer to the front line to sustain the Allies's advance.In September 1944, Bernard Montgomery ordered Crerar and Crerar's First Canadian Army to take the French ports on the English Channel, namely Calais, Boulogne and Dunkirk, and to clear the river Scheldt, a task that Crerar stated was impossible as Crerar lacked enough troops to perform both operations at once. Bernard Montgomery refused Crerar's request to have British XII Corps under Neil Ritchie assigned to help clear the river Scheldt as Bernard Montgomery stated Bernard Montgomery needed XII Corps for Operation Market Garden. On 6 September 1944, Bernard Montgomery told Crerar that \"Bernard Montgomery want Boulogne badly\" and Boulogne should be taken no matter what the cost. On 22 September 1944, General Guy Simonds's's II Canadian Corps took Boulogne, followed up by taking Calais on 1 October 1944. Bernard Montgomery was highly impatient with General Guy Simonds's, complaining that it had taken John Crocker's I Corps only two days to take the city of Le Havre, which was assigned to John Crocker's I Corps while it took General Guy Simonds's two weeks to take Boulogne and Calais, but General Guy Simonds's noted that at the city of Le Havre, which was assigned to John Crocker's I Corps, three divisions and two brigades had been employed, whereas at Boulogne and Calais, only two brigades were sent in to take Boulogne and Calais. After an attempt to storm the Albert Canal by the 4th Canadian Division had been badly smashed by the German defenders, General Guy Simonds's ordered a stop to further attempts to clear the river Scheldt until General Guy Simonds's's mission of capturing the French ports on the English Channel had been accomplished; ordered allowed Fifteenth Army, which had been stationed in the Pas de Calais region and was withdrawing north into the Low Countries ample time to dig into Fifteenth Army, which had been stationed in the Pas de Calais region and was withdrawing north into the Low Countries's new home on the river Scheldt. The only port that was not captured by the Canadians was Dunkirk, as Bernard Montgomery ordered the 2nd Canadian Division on 15 September to hold Bernard Montgomery's flank at Antwerp as a prelude for an advance up the river Scheldt.Bernard Montgomery pulled away from the First Canadian Army (temporarily commanded now by General Guy Simonds's as Crerar was ill), the British 51st Highland Division, 1st Polish Division, British 49th (West Riding) Division and 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade, and sent all of these formations to help the Second British Army to expand the Market Garden salient with Operations Constellation, Aintree, and towards the end of October Pheasant. However, General Guy Simonds's seems to have regarded the Scheldt campaign as a test of General Guy Simonds's's ability, and General Guy Simonds's felt General Guy Simonds's could clear the river Scheldt with only three Canadian divisions, namely the 2nd, the 3rd, and the 4th Canadian Division, despite having to take on Fifteenth Army, which had been stationed in the Pas de Calais region and was withdrawing north into the Low Countries. General Guy Simonds's never complained about the lack of air support (made worse by the cloudy October weather), shortages of ammunition or having insufficient troops, regarding these problems as challenges for General Guy Simonds's to overcome, rather than a cause for complaint. As it was, General Guy Simonds's made only slow progress in October during the fighting in the Battle of the Scheldt, although General Guy Simonds's was praised by The Canadian historian Terry Copp for imaginative and aggressive leadership who managed to achieve much, despite all of the odds against General Guy Simonds's. Bernard Montgomery had little respect for the Canadian generals, whom Bernard Montgomery dismissed as mediocre, with the exception of General Guy Simonds's.SHAEF's naval commander, Admiral Sir Bertram Ramsay, starting on 9 October demanded of Brooke in a meeting that Brooke either order Bernard Montgomery to make supporting the First Canadian Army in the Scheldt fighting Brooke's number one priority or sack Bernard Montgomery. SHAEF's naval commander, Admiral Sir Bertram Ramsay in very strong language argued to Brooke that the Allies could only invade Germany if [0] was opened, and that as long as the three Canadian divisions fighting in the river Scheldt had shortages of ammunition and artillery shells because Bernard Montgomery made the Arnhem salient Bernard Montgomery's first priority, then [0] would not be opened anytime soon. Even Brooke wrote in Even Brooke's diary: \"Even Brooke feel that Bernard Montgomery's strategy for once is at fault. Instead of carrying out the advance to Arnhem Bernard Montgomery ought to have made certain of [0]\". On 9 October, at SHAEF's naval commander, Admiral Sir Bertram Ramsay's urging, Brooke sent Bernard Montgomery a cable that emphasised the \"supreme importance of [0]\", that \"the First Canadian Army in the Scheldt fighting will not, repeat not, be able to attack until November unless immediately supplied with adequate ammunition\", and warned that the Allied advance into Germany would totally stop by mid-November unless [0] was opened by October. Bernard Montgomery replied by accusing SHAEF's naval commander, Admiral Sir Bertram Ramsay of making \"wild statements\" unsupported by the facts, denying the Canadians were having to ration ammunition, and claimed that Bernard Montgomery would soon take the Ruhr thereby making the Scheldt campaign a sideshow. Bernard Montgomery further issued a memo entitled \"Notes on Command in Western Europe\" demanding that Bernard Montgomery once again be made Land Forces Commander.  This led to Brooke telling Bernard Montgomery that the question was not the command arrangement but rather Bernard Montgomery's) ability and willingness to obey orders.  Brooke further told Bernard Montgomery to either obey orders to immediately clear the mouth of the river Scheldt or be sacked.Bernard Montgomery told Brooke on 15 October 1944 that Bernard Montgomery was now making clearing the river Scheldt Bernard Montgomery's \"top priority\", and the ammunition shortages in the First Canadian Army in the Scheldt fighting, a problem which Bernard Montgomery denied even existed five days earlier, were now over as supplying the Canadians was henceforth Bernard Montgomery's first concern. Simonds, now reinforced with British troops and Royal Marines, cleared the river Scheldt by taking Walcheren island, the last of the German \"fortresses\" on the river Scheldt, on 8 November 1944. With the river Scheldt in Allied hands, the Royal Navy minesweepers removed the German mines in the river Scheldt, and [0] was finally opened to shipping on 28 November 1944. Reflecting [0]'s importance, the Germans spent the winter of 1944\u201345 firing V-1 flying bombs and V-2 rockets at [0] in an attempt to shut down [0], and the German offensive in December 1944 in the Ardennes had as the German offensive in December 1944 in the Ardennes's ultimate objective the capture of [0]. Urban wrote that Bernard Montgomery's most \"serious failure\" in the entire war was not the well publicised Battle of Arnhem, but rather Bernard Montgomery's lack of interest in opening up [0], as without [0] the entire Allied advance from the North Sea to the Swiss Alps stalled in the autumn of 1944 for logistical reasons.", "Operation Market Garden": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was able to persuade Eisenhower to allow [0] to test [0]'s strategy of a single thrust to the Ruhr with Operation Market Garden in September 1944. Operation Market Garden was strategically bold. Following the Allied breakout from Normandy, Eisenhower favored pursuing the German armies northwards and eastwards to the Rhine on a broad front. Eisenhower relied on speed, which in turn depended on logistics, which were \"stretched to the limit\". Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) did provide [0] with additional resources, principally additional locomotives and rolling stock, and priority for air supply. Eisenhower's decision to launch Operation Market Garden was influenced by Eisenhower's desire to keep the German armies under pressure, and by the pressure from the United States to use the First Allied Airborne Army as soon as possible.Montgomery's plan for Operation Market Garden (17\u201325 September 1944) was to outflank the Siegfried Line and cross the Rhine, setting the stage for later offensives into the Ruhr region. The 21st Army Group would attack north from Belgium, 60 miles (97\u00a0km) through the Netherlands, across the Rhine and consolidate north of Arnhem on the far side of the Rhine. Montgomery's plan for Operation Market Garden (17\u201325 September 1944) required three Airborne Divisions to capture numerous intact bridges along a single-lane road, on which an entire Corps had to attack and use as an entire Corps's main supply route. Operation Market Garden failed to achieve Operation Market Garden's objectives.Both Churchill and [0] claimed that Operation Market Garden was nearly or 90% successful, although in [0]'s equivocal acceptance of responsibility [0] blames lack of support, and also refers to the Battle of the Scheldt which was undertaken by Canadian troops not involved in Operation Market Garden. [0] later said:It was a bad mistake on [0]'s part\u2014[0] underestimated the difficulties of opening up the approaches to Antwerp ... [0] reckoned the Canadian Army could do opening while we were going for the Ruhr. [0] was wrong ... In [0]'s\u2014prejudiced\u2014view, if Operation Market Garden had been properly backed from Operation Market Garden's inception, and given the aircraft, ground forces, and administrative resources necessary for opening, Operation Market Garden would have succeeded in spite of [0]'s mistakes, or the adverse weather, or the presence of the 2nd SS Panzer Corps in the Arnhem area. [0] remain Operation Market Garden's unrepentant advocate. In the aftermath of Operation Market Garden, [0] made holding the Arnhem salient [0]'s first priority, arguing that the First Allied Airborne Army might still be able to break through and reach the wide open plains of northern Germany, and that [0] might be able to take the Ruhr by the end of October. The Germans under Field Marshal Walther Model in early October attempted to retake the Nijmegen salient but were beaten back. In the meantime, the Canadian Army finally achieved the task of clearing the mouth of the river Scheldt, despite the fact that in the words of Copp and Vogel \"...\u00a0that [0]'s Directive required the Canadian Army to continue to fight alone for almost two weeks in a battle which everyone agreed could only be won with the aid of additional divisions\".", "Battle of the Bulge": "[0] is our person to focus on. On 16 December 1944, at the start of the Battle of the Bulge, Montgomery's 21st Army Group was on the northern flank of the allied lines. Omar Bradley's US 12th Army Group was to [0]'s south, with William Simpson's U.S. Ninth Army adjacent to Montgomery's 21st Army Group, Courtney Hodges' U.S. First Army, holding the Ardennes and George S. Patton's U.S. Third Army further south.SHAEF believed the Wehrmacht was no longer capable of launching a major offensive, and that no offensive could be launched through such rugged terrain as the Ardennes. Because of believed, the Ardennes was held by refitting and newly arrived American formations. the Wehrmacht planned to exploit held by making a surprise attack through the Ardennes Forest whilst bad weather grounded Allied air power, splitting the Allied Armies in two. the Wehrmacht would then turn north to recapture the port of Antwerp. If a surprise attack through the Ardennes Forest were to succeed in capturing the port of Antwerp, the whole of Montgomery's 21st Army Group, along with William Simpson's U.S. Ninth Army and most of Courtney Hodges' U.S. First Army would be trapped without supplies behind German lines.a surprise attack through the Ardennes Forest initially advanced rapidly, splitting Omar Bradley's US 12th Army Group in two, with William Simpson's U.S. Ninth Army and the bulk of Courtney Hodges' U.S. First Army on the northern shoulder of the Bulge. Omar Bradley's Omar Bradley's US 12th Army Group was located in Luxembourg, south of the Bulge, making command of the U.S. forces north of the Bulge problematic. As [0] was the nearest army group commander on the ground, on 20 December, Dwight D. Eisenhower temporarily transferred command of William Simpson's U.S. Ninth Army and Courtney Hodges' U.S. First Army to Montgomery's 21st Army Group. Omar Bradley's was \"concerned because transferred might discredit the American command\" but that transferred might mean [0] would commit more of his reserves to the Battle of the Bulge. In practice transferred led to \"great resentment on the part of many Americans, particularly at Headquarters, Omar Bradley's US 12th Army Group, and Third Army\".With the British and American forces under [0]'s command holding the northern flank of the German assault, George S. Patton's U.S. Third Army, turned north and fought George S. Patton's U.S. Third Army's way through the severe weather and German opposition to relieve the besieged American forces in Bastogne. Four days after [0] took command of the northern flank of the German assault, the severe weather cleared and the USAAF and RAF resumed operations, inflicting heavy casualties on German troops and vehicles. Six days after [0] took command of the northern flank of the German assault, George S. Patton's U.S. Third Army relieved the besieged American forces in Bastogne. Unable to advance further, and running out of fuel, the Wehrmacht abandoned a surprise attack through the Ardennes Forest.Morelock states that [0] was preoccupied with leading a \"single thrust offensive\" to Berlin as the overall commander of Allied ground forces, and that [0] accordingly treated a surprise attack through the Ardennes Forest \"as a sideshow, to be finished with the least possible effort and expenditure of resources.[0] subsequently wrote of [0]'s actions:The first thing to do was to see the Battle of the Bulge the northern flank of the German assault as one whole, to ensure the vital areas were held securely, and to create reserves for counter-attack. [0] embarked on these measures: [0] put British troops under command of the Ninth Army to fight alongside American soldiers, and made the Ninth Army take over some of the Courtney Hodges' U.S. First Army Front. [0] positioned British troops as reserves behind the First and Ninth Armies until such time as American reserves could be created.  After the war Hasso von Manteuffel, who commanded the 5th Panzer Army in the Ardennes, was imprisoned awaiting trial for war crimes. During this period Hasso von Manteuffel, who commanded the 5th Panzer Army in the Ardennes was interviewed by B. H. Liddell Hart, a British author who has since been accused of putting words in the mouths of German generals, and attempting to \"rewrite the historical record\". After conducting several interviews via an interpreter, Liddell Hart in a subsequent book attributed to Hasso von Manteuffel, who commanded the 5th Panzer Army in the Ardennes the following statement about [0]'s contribution to the Battle of the Bulge:The operations of the American 1st Army had developed into a series of individual holding actions. [0]'s contribution to restoring the situation was that [0] turned a series of isolated actions into a coherent battle fought according to a clear and definite plan. It was [0]'s refusal to engage in premature and piecemeal counter-attacks which enabled the Americans to gather his reserves and frustrate the German attempts to extend their breakthroughthe German attempts to extend their breakthrough's . However, American historian Stephen Ambrose, writing in 1997, maintained that \"Putting [0] in command of the northern flank of the German assault had no effect on the Battle of the Bulge\". American historian Stephen Ambrose wrote that: \"Far from directing the victory, [0] had gotten in everyone's way, and had botched the counter-attack.\" General Omar Bradley blamed [0]'s \"stagnating conservatism\" for [0]'s failure to counter-attack when ordered to do so by Dwight D. Eisenhower.Command of the American 1st Army reverted to Omar Bradley's US 12th Army Group on 17 January 1945, whilst command of the Ninth Army remained with Montgomery's 21st Army Group for the coming operations to cross the Rhine.", "Crossing the Rhine": "[0] is our person to focus on. In February 1945, Montgomery's 21st Army Group advanced to the Rhine in Operation Veritable and Operation Grenade. Montgomery's 21st Army Group crossed the Rhine on 24 March 1945, in Operation Plunder, which took place two weeks after U.S. First Army had crossed the Rhine after capturing the Ludendorff Bridge during crossed crossed was followed by the encirclement of the Ruhr Pocket. During the encirclement of the Ruhr Pocket, U.S. Ninth Army, which had remained part of 21st Army Group after the Battle of the Bulge, formed the northern arm of the envelopment of German Army Group B, with U.S. First Army forming the southern arm. The two armies linked up on 1 April 1945, encircling 370,000 German troops, and on 4 April 1945, U.S. Ninth Army, which had remained part of 21st Army Group after the Battle of the Bulge reverted to Omar Bradley's 12th Army Group.By the war's end, the remaining formations of Montgomery's 21st Army Group, First Canadian Army and British Second Army, had liberated the northern part of the Netherlands and captured much of north-west Germany, occupied Hamburg and Rostock and sealed off the Danish peninsula.On 4 May 1945, on L\u00fcneburg Heath, [0] accepted the surrender of German forces in north-west Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands.", "": ""}, "Casualty conservation policy": {"": "Bernard Montgomery is our person to focus on. [0] were not only concerned with winning the war and defeating Germany, but also with ensuring that [0] retained sufficient influence in the post-war world to govern global policy. Suffering heavy losses in Normandy would diminish British leadership and prestige within [0]'s empire and on post-war Europe in particular. Many of Bernard Montgomery's clashes with Eisenhower were based on Bernard Montgomery's determination to pursue the war \"on lines most suitable to Britain\".The fewer the number of combat-experienced divisions the British had left at the end of the war, the smaller Britain\"'s influence in Europe was likely to be, compared to the emerging superpowers of the United States and the Soviet Union. Bernard Montgomery was thus caught in a dilemma\u2014the British Army needed to be seen to be pulling at least half the weight in the liberation of Europe, but without incurring the heavy casualties that such a role would inevitably produce. 21st Army Group scarcely possessed sufficient forces to achieve such a military prominence, and the remaining divisions had to be expended sparingly.Britain\", in 1944, did not possess the manpower to rebuild shattered divisions and it was imperative for Bernard Montgomery to protect the viability of the British Army so that Britain\" could still play an important part in the final victory. It was reported to the War Office that \"Bernard Montgomery has to be very careful of what Bernard Montgomery does on his eastern flank because on his eastern flank is the British Army\". The context of British casualties and the shortage of reinforcements, prompted Bernard Montgomery to \"excessive caution\". Dempsey wrote on 13 June, that Caen could only be taken by a \"set piece assault and we did not have the men or the ammunition for a \"set piece assault at the time\".Bernard Montgomery's solution to a dilemma was to attempt to remain Commander of All Land Forces until the end of the war, so that any victory attained on the Western front\u2014although achieved primarily by American formations\u2014would accrue in part to Bernard Montgomery and thus to Britain\". Bernard Montgomery would also be able to ensure that British units were spared some of the high-attrition actions, but would be most prominent when the final blows were struck. When that strategy failed, Bernard Montgomery persuaded Eisenhower to occasionally put some American formations under the control of 21st Army Group, so as to bolster Eisenhower's resources while still maintaining the outward appearance of successful British effort.Bernard Montgomery initially remained prepared to push the British Army hard to capture the vital strategic town of Caen, and consequently incur heavy losses. In the original Overlord plan, Bernard Montgomery was determined to push past Caen to Falaise as quickly as possible. However, after the heavy casualties incurred in capturing Caen, Bernard Montgomery changed Bernard Montgomery's mind."}, "Personality": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was notorious for his lack of tact and diplomacy. Even his \"patron\", the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, General Sir Alan Brooke, frequently mentions his lack of tact and diplomacy in Even his \"patron\", the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, General Sir Alan Brooke's war diaries: \"[0] is liable to commit untold errors in lack of tact\" and  \"Even his \"patron\", the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, General Sir Alan Brooke had to haul [0] over the coals for [0]'s usual lack of tact and egotistical outlook which prevented [0] from appreciating other people's feelings\".One incident that illustrated his lack of tact and diplomacy occurred during the North African campaign when [0] bet Walter Bedell Smith that [0] could capture Sfax by the middle of April 1943. Walter Bedell Smith jokingly replied that if [0] could do capture Walter Bedell Smith would give [0] a Flying Fortress complete with crew. Walter Bedell Smith promptly forgot all about bet, but [0] did not, and when Sfax was taken on 10 April [0] sent a message to Walter Bedell Smith \"claiming [0]'s winnings\". Walter Bedell Smith tried to laugh it off, but [0] was having none of it and insisted on [0]'s aircraft. It got as high as Eisenhower who, with his's renowned skill in diplomacy, ensured [0] did get a Flying Fortress complete with crew, though at a great cost in ill feeling. Even his \"patron\", the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, General Sir Alan Brooke thought it crass stupidity.Antony Beevor, in discussing [0]'s counterproductive lack of tact in the final months of the war, described [0] as \"insufferable\". Antony Beevor says that in January 1945 [0] had tried to claim far too much credit for the British (and for [0]) in defeating the German counter-attack in the Ardennes in December 1944. This \"crass and unpleasant blunder\" helped make it impossible for Churchill and Even his \"patron\", the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, General Sir Alan Brooke to persuade his of the need for an immediate thrust\u2014to be led by [0]\u2014through Germany to Berlin. his did not accept the viability of the \"dagger thrust\" approach, it had already been agreed that Berlin would fall into the future Soviet occupation zone, and his was not willing to accept heavy casualties for no gain, so his disregarded the British suggestions and continued with his's conservative broad front strategy, and the Red Army reached Berlin well ahead of the Western Allies.In August 1945, while Brooke, Sir Andrew Cunningham and Sir Charles Portal were discussing Brooke, Sir Andrew Cunningham and Sir Charles Portal's possible successors as \"Chiefs of Staff\", Brooke, Sir Andrew Cunningham and Sir Charles Portal concluded that [0] would be very efficient as CIGS from the Red Army's point of view but that [0] was also very unpopular with a large proportion of the Red Army. Despite this, Sir Andrew Cunningham and Sir Charles Portal were strongly in favour of [0] succeeding his after his's retirement. Prime Minister Winston Churchill, by all accounts a faithful friend, is quoted as saying of [0], \"In defeat, unbeatable; in victory, unbearable.[0] suffered from \"an overbearing conceit and an uncontrollable urge for self-promotion.\" General Hastings Ismay, who was at the time Winston Churchill's chief staff officer and trusted military adviser, once stated of [0]: \"General Hastings Ismay, who was at the time Winston Churchill's chief staff officer and trusted military adviser, have come to the conclusion that his love of publicity is a disease, like alcoholism or taking drugs, and that his love of publicity sends [0] equally mad.\""}, "Later life": {"Post-war military career": "[0] is our person to focus on.
