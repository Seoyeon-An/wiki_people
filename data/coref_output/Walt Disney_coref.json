Walter Elias Disney (/\u02c8d\u026azni/; December 5, 1901\u00a0\u2013\u00a0 December 15, 1966) was an American animator, film producer, and entrepreneur. A pioneer of the American animation industry, [0] introduced several developments in the production of cartoons. As a film producer, [0] holds the record for most Academy Awards earned and nominations by an individual. [0] was presented with two Golden Globe Special Achievement Awards and an Emmy Award, among other honors. Several of [0]'s films are included in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress and have also been named as some of the greatest films ever by the American Film Institute.Born in Chicago in 1901, [0] developed an early interest in drawing. [0] took art classes as a boy and took a job as a commercial illustrator at the age of 18. [0] moved to California in the early 1920s and set up the Disney Brothers Studio (now The Walt Disney Company) with [0]'s brother Roy. With Ub Iwerks, [0] developed the character Mickey Mouse in 1928, [0]'s first highly popular success; [0] also provided the voice for the character Mickey Mouse in the early years. As the Disney Brothers Studio (now The Walt Disney Company) grew, [0] became more adventurous, introducing synchronized sound, full-color three-strip Technicolor, feature-length cartoons and technical developments in cameras. The results, seen in features such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), Pinocchio, Fantasia (both 1940), Dumbo (1941), and Bambi (1942), furthered the development of animated film. New animated and live-action films followed after World War II, including the critically successful Cinderella (1950), Sleeping Beauty (1959) and Mary Poppins (1964), the last of which received five Academy Awards.In the 1950s, [0] expanded into the amusement park industry, and in July 1955 [0] opened Disneyland in Anaheim, California. To fund the project [0] diversified into television programs, such as [0]'s Disneyland and The Mickey Mouse Club. [0] was also involved in planning the 1959 Moscow Fair, the 1960 Winter Olympics, and the 1964 New York World's Fair. In 1965, [0] began development of another theme park, Disney World, the heart of which was to be a new type of city, the \"Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow\" (EPCOT). [0] was a heavy smoker throughout [0]'s life and died of lung cancer in December 1966 before either the park or the EPCOT project were completed.[0] was a shy, self-deprecating and insecure man in private but adopted a warm and outgoing public persona. [0] had high standards and high expectations of those with whom [0] worked. Although there have been accusations that he was racist or antisemitic, accusations that he was racist or antisemitic have been contradicted by many who knew [0]. Historiography of [0] has taken a variety of perspectives, ranging from views of [0] as a purveyor of homely patriotic values to being a representative of American imperialism. Widely considered to be one of the most influential cultural figures of the 20th century, [0] remains an important presence in the history of animation and in the cultural history of the United States, where [0] is acknowledged as a national cultural icon. [0]'s film work continues to be shown and adapted, the [0] theme parks have grown in size and number to attract visitors in several countries and [0]'s company has grown to become one of the world's largest mass media and entertainment conglomerates."}, "Early life": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was born on December 5, 1901, at 1249 Tripp Avenue, in Chicago's's Hermosa neighborhood. [0] was the fourth son of Elias Disney\u200d\u2014\u200cborn in the Province of Canada, to Irish parents\u200d\u2014\u200cand Flora (n\u00e9e Call), an American of German and English descent. Aside from [0], Elias Disney\u200d\u2014\u200cborn in the Province of Canada, to Irish parents\u200d\u2014\u200cand's sons were Herbert, Raymond and Roy; and Elias Disney\u200d\u2014\u200cborn in the Province of Canada, to Irish parents\u200d\u2014\u200cand had a fifth child, Ruth, in December 1903. In 1906, when [0] was four, the family moved to a farm in Marceline, Missouri, where [0]'s uncle Robert had just purchased land. In Marceline, Missouri, [0] developed [0]'s interest in drawing when [0] was paid to draw the horse of a retired neighborhood doctor. Elias Disney\u200d\u2014\u200cborn in the Province of Canada, to Irish parents\u200d\u2014\u200cand was a subscriber to the Appeal to Reason newspaper, and [0] practiced drawing by copying the front-page cartoons of Ryan Walker. [0] also began to develop an ability to work with watercolors and crayons. [0] lived near the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway line and became enamored with trains. [0] and a fifth child, Ruth started school at the same time at the Park School in Marceline, Missouri in late 1909. the family were active members of a Congregational church.In 1911, the family moved to Kansas City, Missouri. There, [0] attended the Benton Grammar School, where [0] met fellow-student Walter Pfeiffer, who came from a family of theatre fans and introduced him to the world of vaudeville and motion pictures. Before long, [0] was spending more time at fellow-student Walter Pfeiffer, who came from a family of theatre fans and introduced him to the world of vaudeville and motion pictures's house than at home. Elias Disney\u200d\u2014\u200cborn in the Province of Canada, to Irish parents\u200d\u2014\u200cand had purchased a newspaper delivery route for The Kansas City Star and Kansas City Times. [0] and [0]'s woke up at 4:30 every morning to deliver Kansas City Times before school and repeated the round for the evening Star after school. The schedule was exhausting, and [0] often received poor grades after falling asleep in class, but [0] continued a newspaper delivery route for The Kansas City Star and Kansas City Times for more than six years. [0] attended Saturday courses at the Kansas City Art Institute and also took a correspondence course in cartooning.In 1917, Elias Disney\u200d\u2014\u200cborn in the Province of Canada, to Irish parents\u200d\u2014\u200cand bought stock in a Chicago's jelly producer, the O-Zell Company, and moved back to Kansas City, Missouri with Elias Disney\u200d\u2014\u200cborn in the Province of Canada, to Irish parents\u200d\u2014\u200cand's . [0] enrolled at McKinley High School and became the cartoonist of the school newspaper, drawing patriotic pictures about World War I; [0] also took night courses at the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts. In mid-1918, [0] attempted to join the United States Army to fight the Germans, but [0] was rejected as too young. After forging the date of birth on [0]'s birth certificate, [0] joined the Red Cross in September 1918 as an ambulance driver. [0] was shipped to France but arrived in November, after the armistice. [0] drew cartoons on the side of [0]'s ambulance for decoration and had some of [0]'s work published in the army newspaper Stars and Stripes. [0] returned to Kansas City, Missouri in October 1919, where [0] worked as an apprentice artist at the Pesmen-Rubin Commercial Art Studio, where [0] drew commercial illustrations for advertising, theater programs and catalogs, and befriended fellow artist Ub Iwerks."}, "Career": {"Early career: 1920\u20131928": "Walt Disney is our person to focus on. In January 1920, as Pesmen-Rubin's revenue declined after Christmas, [0] were laid off. [0] started [0]'s own business, the short-lived Iwerks-Disney Commercial Artists. Failing to attract many customers, [0] agreed that Walt Disney should leave temporarily to earn money at the Kansas City Film Ad Company, run by A.\u00a0V. Cauger; the following month Iwerks [0]'s also joined. the Kansas City Film Ad Company, run by A.\u00a0V. Cauger produced commercials using the cutout animation technique. Walt Disney became interested in animation, although Walt Disney preferred drawn cartoons such as Mutt and Jeff and Max Fleischer's Out of the Inkwell. With the assistance of a borrowed book on animation and a camera, Walt Disney began experimenting at home. Walt Disney came to the conclusion that cel animation was more promising than the cutout animation technique. Unable to persuade A.\u00a0V. Cauger to try cel animation at the Kansas City Film Ad Company, run by A.\u00a0V. Cauger, Walt Disney opened a new business with a co-worker from the Film Ad Co, Fred Harmanthe Kansas City Film Ad Company, run by A.\u00a0V. Cauger. Their's main client was the local Newman Theater, and the short cartoons they produced were sold as \"Newman's Laugh-O-Grams\". Walt Disney studied Paul Terry's Aesop's Fables as a model, and \"Newman's Laugh-O-Grams\" were modernized fairy tales.In May 1921, the success of the short cartoons they produced led to the establishment of Laugh-O-Gram Studio, for which Walt Disney hired more animators, including a co-worker from the Film Ad Co, Fred Harman's brother Hugh, Rudolf Ising and Iwerks. the short cartoons they produced did not provide enough income to keep a new business solvent, so Walt Disney started production of Alice's Wonderland\u200d\u2014\u200cbased on Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\u200d\u2014\u200cwhich combined live action with animation; Walt Disney cast Virginia Davis in the title role. The result, a 12\u00bd-minute, one-reel film, was completed too late to save Laugh-O-Gram Studio, which went into bankruptcy in Walt Disney moved to Hollywood in July 1923 at 21 years old. Although New York was the center of the cartoon industry, Walt Disney was attracted to Los Angeles because his brother Roy was convalescing from tuberculosis there, and Walt Disney hoped to become a live-action film director. Walt Disney's efforts to sell Alice's Wonderland\u200d\u2014\u200cbased on Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\u200d\u2014\u200cwhich combined live action with animation were in vain until Walt Disney heard from New York film distributor Margaret J. Winkler. New York film distributor Margaret J. Winkler was losing the rights to both the Out of the Inkwell and Felix the Cat cartoons, and needed a new series. In October, they signed a contract for six Alice comedies, with an option for two further series of six episodes each. Walt Disney his brother Roy formed the Disney Brothers Studio\u200d\u2014\u200cwhich later became The Walt Disney Company\u200d\u2014\u200cto produce six Alice comedies; they persuaded Virginia Davis and Virginia Davis's family to relocate to Hollywood to continue production, with Virginia Davis on contract at $100 a month. In July 1924, Walt Disney also hired Iwerks, persuading Iwerks to relocate to Hollywood from Kansas City. In 1926, the first official Walt Disney Studio was established at 2725 Hyperion Avenue; 2725 Hyperion Avenue was demolished in 1940.By 1926, New York film distributor Margaret J. Winkler's role in the distribution of the short cartoons they produced had been handed over to her husband, the film producer Charles Mintz, although the relationship between her husband, the film producer Charles Mintz and Walt Disney was sometimes strained. the short cartoons they produced ran until July 1927, by which time Walt Disney had begun to tire of the short cartoons they produced and wanted to move away from the mixed format to all animation. After her husband, the film producer Charles Mintz requested new material to distribute through Universal Pictures, [0] created Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, a character Disney wanted to be \"peppy, alert, saucy and venturesome, keeping him also neat and trim\"Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, a character Disney wanted to be \"peppy, alert, saucy and venturesome, keeping him also neat and trim\" .In February 1928, Walt Disney hoped to negotiate a larger fee for producing the Oswald series, but found her husband, the film producer Charles Mintz wanting to reduce the payments. her husband, the film producer Charles Mintz had also persuaded many of the artists involved to work directly for her husband, the film producer Charles Mintz, including Harman, Ising, Carman Maxwell and Friz Freleng. Walt Disney also found out that Universal Pictures owned the intellectual property rights to Oswald. her husband, the film producer Charles Mintz threatened to start her husband, the film producer Charles Mintz's own studio and produce the Oswald series her husband, the film producer Charles Mintz if Walt Disney refused to accept reduce. Walt Disney declined her husband, the film producer Charles Mintz's ultimatum and lost most of Walt Disney's animation staff, except Iwerks, who chose to remain with Walt Disney.", "Creation of Mickey Mouse and early successes: 1928\u20131934": "[0] is our person to focus on. To replace Oswald, Disney and Iwerks developed Mickey Mouse, possibly inspired by a pet mouse that Disney had adopted while working in his Laugh-O-Gram studio, although the origins of Mickey Mouse, possibly inspired by a pet mouse that Disney had adopted while working in his Laugh-O-Gram studio are unclear. [0]'s original choice of name was Mortimer Mouse, but his wife Lillian thought Mortimer Mouse too pompous, and suggested Mickey Mouse, possibly inspired by a pet mouse that Disney had adopted while working in his Laugh-O-Gram studio instead. Iwerks revised [0]'s provisional sketches to make Mickey Mouse, possibly inspired by a pet mouse that Disney had adopted while working in his Laugh-O-Gram studio easier to animate. Disney, who had begun to distance [0] from the animation process, provided Mickey Mouse, possibly inspired by a pet mouse that Disney had adopted while working in his Laugh-O-Gram studio's voice until 1947. In the words of one [0] employee, \"Ub designed Mickey Mouse, possibly inspired by a pet mouse that Disney had adopted while working in his Laugh-O-Gram studio's physical appearance, but [0] gave Mickey Mouse, possibly inspired by a pet mouse that Disney had adopted while working in his Laugh-O-Gram studio Mickey Mouse, possibly inspired by a pet mouse that Disney had adopted while working in his Laugh-O-Gram studio's soul.Mickey Mouse, possibly inspired by a pet mouse that Disney had adopted while working in his Laugh-O-Gram studio first appeared in May 1928 as a single test screening of the short Plane Crazy, but the short Plane Crazy, and the second feature, The Gallopin' Gaucho, failed to find a distributor. Following the 1927 sensation The Jazz Singer, [0] used synchronized sound on the third short, Steamboat Willie, to create the first post-produced sound cartoon. After the animation was complete, [0] signed a contract with the former executive of Universal Pictures, Pat Powers, to use the \"Powers Cinephone\" recording system; Cinephone became the new distributor for [0]'s early sound cartoons, which soon became popular.To improve the quality of the music, [0] hired the professional composer and arranger Carl Stalling, on whose suggestion the Silly Symphony series was developed, providing stories through the use of music; the first in the Silly Symphony series, The Skeleton Dance (1929), was drawn and animated entirely by Iwerks. Also hired at this time were several artists, both local and from New York. Both the Mickey Mouse, possibly inspired by a pet mouse that Disney had adopted while working in his Laugh-O-Gram studio and the Silly Symphony series series were successful, but Disney and his brother felt Disney and his brother were not receiving Disney and his brother's rightful share of profits from the former executive of Universal Pictures, Pat Powers. In 1930, [0] tried to trim costs from the process by urging Iwerks to abandon the practice of animating every separate cel in favor of the more efficient technique of drawing key poses and letting assistants sketch the inbetween poses. [0] asked the former executive of Universal Pictures, Pat Powers for an increase in payments for the cartoons. the former executive of Universal Pictures, Pat Powers refused and signed Iwerks to work for the former executive of Universal Pictures, Pat Powers; the professional composer and arranger Carl Stalling, on whose suggestion the Silly Symphony series was developed, providing stories through the use of music resigned shortly afterwards, thinking that without Iwerks, the [0] Studio would close. [0] had a nervous breakdown in October 1931\u200d\u2014\u200cwhich [0] blamed on the machinations of Powers and [0]'s own overwork\u200d\u2014\u200cso Disney and Iwerks his wife Lillian took an extended holiday to Cuba and a cruise to Panama to recover.With the loss of Powers as distributor, Disney studios signed a contract with Columbia Pictures to distribute the Mickey Mouse, possibly inspired by a pet mouse that Disney had adopted while working in his Laugh-O-Gram studio cartoons, which became increasingly popular, including internationally. [0] and [0]'s crew also introduced new cartoon stars like Pluto in 1930, Goofy in 1932 and Donald Duck in 1934. Always keen to embrace new technology and encouraged by [0]'s new contract with United Artists, [0] filmed Flowers and Trees (1932) in full-color three-strip Technicolor; [0] was also able to negotiate a deal giving [0] the sole right to use full-color three-strip Technicolor until August 31, 1935. All subsequent Silly Symphony cartoons were in color. Flowers and Trees (1932) was popular with audiences and won the inaugural Academy Award for best Short Subject (Cartoon) at the 1932 ceremony. [0] had been nominated for another film in best Short Subject (Cartoon), Mickey's Orphans, and received an Honorary Award \"for the creation of Mickey Mouse, possibly inspired by a pet mouse that Disney had adopted while working in his Laugh-O-Gram studio.In 1933, [0] produced The Three Little Pigs, a film described by the media historian Adrian Danks as \"the most successful short animation of all time\". The Three Little Pigs, a film described by the media historian Adrian Danks as \"the most successful short animation of all time\" won [0] another Academy Award in the Short Subject (Cartoon) category. The Three Little Pigs, a film described by the media historian Adrian Danks as \"the most successful short animation of all time\"'s success led to a further increase in Disney studios's staff, which numbered nearly 200 by the end of 1933. [0] realized the importance of telling emotionally gripping stories that would interest the audience, and [0] invested in a \"story department\" separate from the animators, with storyboard artists who would detail the plots of [0]'s films.", "Golden age of animation: 1934\u20131941": "[0] is our person to focus on. By 1934, [0] had become dissatisfied with producing formulaic cartoon shorts, and believed a feature-length cartoon would be more profitable. The studio began the four-year production of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, based on the fairy tale. When news leaked out about the four-year production of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, based on the fairy tale, many in the film industry predicted the four-year production of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, based on the fairy tale would bankrupt The studio; industry insiders nicknamed the four-year production of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, based on the fairy tale \"[0]'s Folly\". Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, based on the fairy tale cost $1.5\u00a0million to produce\u200d\u2014\u200cthree times over budget. To ensure the animation was as realistic as possible, [0] sent his animators on courses at the Chouinard Art Institute; [0] brought animals into The studio and hired actors so that his animators could study realistic movement. To portray the changing perspective of the background as a camera moved through a scene, his animators developed a multiplane camera which allowed drawings on pieces of glass to be set at various distances from the camera, creating an illusion of depth. pieces of glass could be moved to create the impression of a camera passing through a scene. The first work created on the camera\u200d\u2014\u200ca Silly Symphony called The Old Mill (1937)\u200d\u2014\u200cwon the Academy Award for Animated Short Film because of The first work created on the camera\u200d\u2014\u200ca Silly Symphony called The Old Mill (1937)\u200d\u2014\u200cwon's impressive visual power. Although Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, based on the fairy tale had been largely finished by the time a multiplane camera which allowed drawings on pieces of glass to be set at various distances from the camera, creating an illusion of depth had been completed, [0] ordered some scenes be re-drawn to use the new effects.Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, based on the fairy tale premiered in December 1937 to high praise from critics and audiences. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, based on the fairy tale became the most successful motion picture of 1938 and by May 1939 Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, based on the fairy tale's total gross of $6.5\u00a0million made Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, based on the fairy tale the most successful sound film made to that date. [0] won another Honorary Academy Award, which consisted of one full-sized and seven miniature Oscar statuettes. The success of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, based on the fairy tale heralded one of the most productive eras for The studio; the Walt Disney Family Museum calls the following years \"the 'Golden Age of Animation'\u202f\". With work on Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, based on the fairy tale finished, The studio began producing Pinocchio in early 1938 and Fantasia in November of 1938. Both films were released in 1940, and neither performed well at the box office\u200d\u2014\u200cpartly because revenues from Europe had dropped following the start of World War II in 1939. The studio incurred a loss on Both films and was deeply in debt by the end of February 1941.In response to the financial crisis, [0] and [0]'s brother Roy started The studio's first public stock offering in 1940, and implemented heavy salary cuts. implemented, and [0]'s sometimes high-handed and insensitive manner of dealing with staff, led to a 1941 animators' strike which lasted five weeks. While a federal mediator from the National Labor Relations Board negotiated with the two sides, [0] accepted an offer from the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs to make a goodwill trip to South America, ensuring [0] was absent during a resolution [0] knew would be unfavorable to The studio. Due to the strike\u200d\u2014\u200cand the financial state of the company\u200d\u2014\u200cseveral animators left The studio, and [0]'s relationship with other members of staff was permanently strained as a result. a 1941 animators' strike which lasted five weeks temporarily interrupted The studio's next production, Dumbo (1941), which [0] produced in a simple and inexpensive manner; Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, based on the fairy tale received a positive reaction from audiences and critics alike.", "World War II and beyond: 1941\u20131950": "[0] is our person to focus on. Shortly after the release of Dumbo in October 1941, the U.S. entered World War\u00a0II. [0] formed the Walt Disney Training Films Unit within [0] to produce instruction films for the military such as Four Methods of Flush Riveting and Aircraft Production Methods. [0] also met with Henry Morgenthau Jr., the Secretary of the Treasury, and agreed to produce short Donald Duck cartoons to promote war bonds. [0] also produced several propaganda productions, including shorts such as Der Fuehrer's Face\u200d\u2014\u200cwhich won an Academy Award\u200d\u2014\u200cand the 1943 feature film Victory Through Air Power.several propaganda productions, including shorts such as Der Fuehrer's Face\u200d\u2014\u200cwhich won an Academy Award\u200d\u2014\u200cand the 1943 feature film Victory Through Air Power generated only enough revenue to cover costs, and the feature film Bambi\u200d\u2014\u200cwhich had been in production since 1937\u200d\u2014\u200cunderperformed on the feature film Bambi\u200d\u2014\u200cwhich had been in production since 1937\u200d\u2014\u200cunderperformed's release in April 1942, and lost $200,000 at the box office. On top of the low earnings from Dumbo and Fantasia, [0] had debts of $4\u00a0million with the Bank of America in 1944. At a meeting with the Bank of America executives to discuss the future of [0], the bank's chairman and founder, Amadeo Giannini, told the bank's chairman and founder, Amadeo Giannini,'s executives, \"the bank's chairman and founder, Amadeo Giannini,'ve been watching [0]'s pictures quite closely because the bank's chairman and founder, Amadeo Giannini, knew the Bank of America were lending [0] money far above the financial risk.\u00a0... [0]'re good this year, [0]'re good next year, and [0]'re good the year after.\u00a0... You have to relax and give [0] time to market [0]'s product.\" [0]'s production of short films decreased in the late 1940s, coinciding with increasing competition in the animation market from Warner Bros. and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Roy Disney, for financial reasons, suggested more combined animation and live-action productions. In 1948, [0] initiated a series of popular live-action nature films, titled True-Life Adventures, with Seal Island the first; Seal Island won the Academy Award in the Best Short Subject (Two-Reel) category.", "Theme parks, television and other interests: 1950\u20131966": "[0] is our person to focus on. In early 1950, [0] produced Cinderella, his studio's first animated feature in eight years. Cinderella, his studio's first animated feature in eight years was popular with critics and theater audiences. Costing $2.2\u00a0million to produce, Cinderella, his studio's first animated feature in eight years earned nearly $8\u00a0million in Cinderella, his studio's first animated feature in eight years's first year. [0] was less involved than [0] had been with previous pictures because of [0]'s involvement in [0]'s first entirely live-action feature, Treasure Island (1950), which was shot in Britain, as was The Story of Robin Hood and Robin Hood's Merrie Men (1952). Other all-live-action features followed, many of which had patriotic themes. [0] continued to produce full-length animated features too, including Alice in Wonderland (1951) and Peter Pan (1953). From the early to mid-1950s, [0] began to devote less attention to the animation department, entrusting most of the animation department's operations to [0]'s key animators, the Nine Old Men, although [0] was always present at story meetings. Instead, [0] started concentrating on other ventures. Around the same time, [0]  established [0]'s own film distribution division Buena Vista, replacing [0]'s most recent distributor RKO Pictures.For several years [0] had been considering building a theme park. When [0] visited Griffith Park in Los Angeles with [0]'s daughters, [0] wanted to be in a clean, unspoiled park, where both children and both children's parents could have fun. [0] visited the Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen, Denmark, and was heavily influenced by the cleanliness and layout of Griffith Park in Los Angeles. In March 1952 [0] received zoning permission to build a theme park in Burbank, near the his studio's studios. This site proved too small, and a larger plot in Anaheim, 35 miles (56\u00a0km) south of his studio's, was purchased. To distance the project from the studio\u200d\u2014\u200cwhich might attract the criticism of [0] formed WED Enterprises (now Walt Disney Imagineering) and used [0]'s own money to fund a group of designers and animators to work on the plans; a group of designers and animators to work on the plans became known as \"Imagineers\". After obtaining bank funding [0] invited other stockholders, American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres\u200d\u2014\u200cpart of American Broadcasting Company (ABC)\u200d\u2014\u200cand Western Printing and Lithographing Company. In mid-1954, [0] sent a group of designers and animators to work on the plans to every amusement park in the U.S. to analyze what worked and what pitfalls or problems there were in the various locations and incorporated their findings into [0]'s design. Construction work started in July 1954, and Disneyland opened in July 1955; the opening ceremony was broadcast on ABC, which reached 70\u00a0million viewers. Disneyland was designed as a series of themed lands, linked by the central Main Street, U.S.A.\u200d\u2014\u200ca replica of the main street in [0]'s hometown of Marceline. The connected themed areas were Adventureland, Frontierland, Fantasyland and Tomorrowland. Disneyland also contained the narrow gauge Disneyland Railroad that linked The connected themed areas; around the outside of Disneyland was a high berm to separate Disneyland from the outside world. An editorial in The New York Times considered that [0] had \"tastefully combined some of the pleasant things of yesterday with fantasy and dreams of tomorrow\". Although there were early minor problems with Disneyland, Disneyland was a success, and after a month's operation, Disneyland was receiving over 20,000 visitors a day; by the end of Disneyland's first year, Disneyland attracted 3.6\u00a0million guests.The money from ABC ABC, which reached 70\u00a0million viewers was contingent on his studio's television programs. his studio's had been involved in a successful television special on Christmas Day 1950 about the making of Alice in Wonderland. [0] believed a successful television special on Christmas Day 1950 about the making of Alice in Wonderland added millions to the box office takings. In a March 1951 letter to shareholders, [0] wrote that \"television can be a most powerful selling aid for his studio's, as well as a source of revenue. It will probably be on this premise that his studio's enter television when his studio's do\". In 1954, after The money from ABC had been agreed, ABC, which reached 70\u00a0million viewers broadcast Walt Disney's Disneyland, an anthology consisting of animated cartoons, live-action features and other material from the studio's library. Walt Disney's Disneyland, an anthology consisting of animated cartoons, live-action features and other material from the studio's library was successful in terms of ratings and profits, earning an audience share of over 50%. In April 1955, Newsweek called Walt Disney's Disneyland, an anthology consisting of animated cartoons, live-action features and other material from the studio's library an \"American institution\". ABC, which reached 70\u00a0million viewers was pleased with the ratings, leading to Disney's first daily television program, The Mickey Mouse Club, a variety show catering specifically to children. Disney's first daily television program, The Mickey Mouse Club, a variety show catering specifically to children was accompanied by merchandising through various companies (Western Printing and Lithographing Company, for example, had been producing coloring books and comics for over 20 years, and produced several items connected to Walt Disney's Disneyland, an anthology consisting of animated cartoons, live-action features and other material from the studio's library). One of the segments of Disneyland consisted of the five-part miniseries Davy Crockett which, according to [0] biographer Neal Gabler, \"became an overnight sensation\". Walt Disney's Disneyland, an anthology consisting of animated cartoons, live-action features and other material from the studio's library's theme song, \"The Ballad of Davy Crockett\", became internationally popular, and ten million records were sold. As a result, [0] formed [0]'s own record production and distribution entity, Disneyland Records.As well as the construction of Disneyland, [0] worked on other projects away from his studio's. [0] was consultant to the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow; his studio's's contribution was America the Beautiful, a 19-minute film in the 360-degree Circarama theater that was one of the most popular attractions. The following year [0] acted as the chairman of the Pageantry Committee for the 1960 Winter Olympics in Squaw Valley, California, where [0] designed the opening, closing and medal ceremonies. [0] was one of twelve investors in the Celebrity Sports Center, which opened in 1960 in Glendale, Colorado; [0] and [0] bought out the others in 1962, making his studio's the sole owner.Despite the demands wrought by non-studio projects, [0] continued to work on film and television projects. In 1955, [0] was involved in \"Man in Space\", an episode of the Disneyland series, which was made in collaboration with NASA rocket designer Wernher von Braun. [0] also oversaw aspects of the full-length features Lady and the Tramp (the first animated film in CinemaScope) in 1955, Sleeping Beauty (the first animated film in Technirama 70 mm film) in 1959, One Hundred and One Dalmatians (the first animated feature film to use Xerox cels) in 1961, and The Sword in the Stone in 1963.In 1964, [0] produced Mary Poppins, based on the book series by P. L. Travers; [0] had been trying to acquire the rights to the story the book series by P. L. Travers since the 1940s. Mary Poppins, based on the book series by P. L. Travers became the most successful his studio's film of the 1960s, although P. L. Travers disliked Mary Poppins, based on the book series by P. L. Travers intensely and regretted having sold the rights to the story. 1964 [0] also became involved in plans to expand the California Institute of the Arts (colloquially called CalArts), and had an architect draw up blueprints for a new building.[0] provided four exhibits for the 1964 New York World's Fair, for which [0] obtained funding from selected corporate sponsors. For PepsiCo, who planned a tribute to UNICEF, [0] developed It's a Small World, a boat ride with audio-animatronic dolls depicting children of the world; Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln contained an animatronic Abraham Lincoln giving excerpts from Mr. Lincoln's speeches; Carousel of Progress promoted the importance of electricity; and Ford's Magic Skyway portrayed the progress of mankind. Elements of all four exhibits\u200d\u2014\u200cprincipally concepts and technology\u200d\u2014\u200cwere re-installed in Disneyland, although It's a Small World, a boat ride with audio-animatronic dolls depicting children of the world is the ride that most closely resembles UNICEF.During the early to mid-1960s, [0] developed plans for a ski resort in Mineral King, a glacial valley in California's Sierra Nevada. [0] hired experts such as the renowned Olympic ski coach and ski-area designer Willy Schaeffler. With income from Disneyland accounting for an increasing proportion of his studio's's income, [0] continued to look for venues for other attractions. In 1963 [0] presented a project to create a theme park in downtown St. Louis, Missouri; [0] initially reached an agreement with the Civic Center Redevelopment Corp, which controlled the land, but the deal later collapsed over funding. In late 1965, [0] announced plans to develop another theme park to be called \"Disney World\" (now Walt Disney World), a few miles southwest of Orlando, Florida. another theme park to be called \"Disney World\" (now Walt Disney World) was to include the \"Magic Kingdom\"\u200d\u2014\u200ca larger and more elaborate version of Disneyland golf courses and resort hotels. The heart of another theme park to be called \"Disney World\" (now Walt Disney World) was to be the \"Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow\" (EPCOT), which [0] described as:an experimental prototype community of tomorrow that will take its cue from the new ideas and new technologies that are now emerging from the creative centers of American industryan experimental prototype community of tomorrow that will take its cue from the new ideas and new technologies that are now emerging from the creative centers of American industry's . an experimental prototype community of tomorrow that will take its cue from the new ideas and new technologies that are now emerging from the creative centers of American industry will be a community of tomorrow that will never be completed, but will always be introducing and testing and demonstrating new materials and systems. And an experimental prototype community of tomorrow that will take its cue from the new ideas and new technologies that are now emerging from the creative centers of American industry will always be a showcase to the world for the ingenuity and imagination of American free enterprise. During 1966, [0] cultivated businesses willing to sponsor an experimental prototype community of tomorrow that will take its cue from the new ideas and new technologies that are now emerging from the creative centers of American industry. [0] received a story credit in the 1966 film Lt. Robin Crusoe, U.S.N. as Retlaw Yensid, [0]'s name spelt backwards. [0] increased [0]'s involvement in his studio's's films, and was heavily involved in the story development of The Jungle Book, the live-action musical feature The Happiest Millionaire (both 1967) and the animated short Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day (1968).", "": ""}, "Illness, death and aftermath": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] had been a heavy smoker since World War\u00a0I. [0] did not use cigarettes with filters and had smoked a pipe as a young man. In early November 1966, [0] was diagnosed with lung cancer and was treated with cobalt therapy. On November 30, [0] felt unwell and was taken by ambulance from [0]'s home to St. Joseph Hospital where, on December 15, 1966, aged 65, [0] died of circulatory collapse caused by lung cancer. [0]'s remains were cremated two days later and [0]'s ashes interred at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.The release of The Jungle Book and The Happiest Millionaire in 1967 raised the total number of feature films that [0] had been involved in to 81. When Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day was released in 1968, Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day earned [0] an Academy Award in the Short Subject (Cartoon) category, awarded posthumously. After [0]'s , his studios continued to produce live-action films prolifically but largely abandoned animation until the late 1980s, after which there was what The New York Times describes as the \"[0] Renaissance\" that began with The Little Mermaid (1989). his studios continue to produce successful film, television and stage entertainment.[0]'s plans for the futuristic city of EPCOT did not come to fruition. After [0]'s , his brother Roy deferred his brother Roy's retirement to take full control of his studios. his brother Roy changed the focus of the futuristic city of EPCOT from a town to an attraction. At the inauguration in 1971, his brother Roy dedicated the futuristic city of EPCOT to his brother Roy's . the futuristic city of EPCOT expanded with the opening of Epcot Center in 1982; [0]'s vision of a functional city was replaced by a park more akin to a permanent world's fair. In 2009, the Walt Disney Family Museum, designed by Disney's daughter Diane and Disney's daughter Diane's son Walter E. D. Miller, opened in the Presidio of San Francisco. Thousands of artifacts from [0]'s life and career are on display, including numerous awards that [0] received. In 2014, the [0] theme parks around the world hosted approximately 134\u00a0million visitors."}, "Personal life and character": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. Early in 1925, [0] hired an ink artist, Lillian Bounds. They married in July of 1925, at an ink artist, Lillian Bounds's brother's house in an ink artist, Lillian Bounds's home town of Lewiston, Idaho. married was generally happy, according to an ink artist, Lillian Bounds, although according to [0]'s biographer Neal Gabler an ink artist, Lillian Bounds did not \"accept [0]'s decisions meekly or [0]'s status unquestionably, and an ink artist, Lillian Bounds admitted that [0] was always telling people 'how henpecked [0] is'.\" an ink artist, Lillian Bounds had little interest in films or the Hollywood social scene and an ink artist, Lillian Bounds was, in the words of the historian Steven Watts, \"content with household management and providing support for an ink artist, Lillian Bounds's \". They's produced two daughters, Diane (born December 1933) and Sharon (adopted in December 1936, born six weeks previously). Within the family, neither [0] nor an ink artist, Lillian Bounds hid the fact Sharon had been adoptedSharon (adopted in December 1936, born six weeks previously) , although two daughters, Diane (born December 1933) and Sharon (adopted in December 1936, born six weeks previously) became annoyed if people outside the family raised the fact Sharon had been adopted. the family were careful to keep two daughters, Diane (born December 1933) and Sharon (adopted in December 1936, born six weeks previously) out of the public eye as much as possible, particularly in the light of the Lindbergh kidnapping; [0] took steps to ensure two daughters, Diane (born December 1933) and Sharon (adopted in December 1936, born six weeks previously) were not photographed by the press.In 1949, [0] and the family moved to a new home in the Holmby Hills district of Los Angeles. With the help of [0]'s friends Ward and Betty Kimball, who already had Ward and Betty Kimball's own backyard railroad, [0] developed blueprints and immediately set to work on creating a miniature live steam railroad for [0]'s back yard. The name of a miniature live steam railroad, Carolwood Pacific Railroad, came from [0]'s home's location on Carolwood Drive. a miniature live steam railroad was built by Disney Studios engineer Roger E. Broggie, and [0] named a miniature live steam railroad Lilly Belle after an ink artist, Lillian Bounds; after three years [0] ordered a miniature live steam railroad into storage due to a series of accidents involving [0]'s guests.[0] grew more politically conservative as [0] got older. A Democratic Party supporter until the 1940 presidential election, when [0] switched allegiance to the Republican Party, [0] became a generous donor to Thomas\u00a0E.\u00a0Dewey's 1944 bid for the presidency. In 1946, [0] was a founding member of the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals, an organization who stated the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals \"believ[ed] in, and like, the American Way of Life\u00a0... we find we in sharp revolt against a rising tide of Communism, Fascism and kindred beliefs, that seek by subversive means to undermine and change the American Way of Life\". In 1947, during the Second Red Scare, [0] testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), where [0] branded Herbert Sorrell, David Hilberman and William Pomerance, former animators and labor union organizers, as communist agitators; [0] stated that the 1941 strike led by Herbert Sorrell, David Hilberman and William Pomerance, former animators and labor union organizers was part of an organized communist effort to gain influence in Hollywood.It was alleged by The New York Times in 1993 that [0] had been an FBI informant passing secret information to J. Edgar Hoover about communist activities in Hollywood. However, while [0] was made a \"Special Agent in Charge Contact\" in 1954, FBI officials claim a \"Special Agent in Charge Contact\" was largely an honorary title regularly awarded to members of a community who might be of use to FBI. FBI declassified and released [0]'s file on FBI's website, and revealed that much of [0]'s correspondence with FBI (via studio personel) was in relation to the production of educational films; such as a certain installment of the \"Career Day\" newsreel segments on The Mickey Mouse Club focusing on FBI (which aired in January 1958), as well as an unmade 1961 educational short warning children about the dangers of child molestation.[0]'s public persona was very different from [0]'s actual personality. Playwright Robert E. Sherwood described [0] as \"almost painfully shy\u00a0... diffident\" and self-deprecating. According to [0]'s biographer Richard Schickel, [0] hid [0]'s shy and insecure personality behind [0]'s public identity. Kimball argues that [0] \"played the role of a bashful tycoon who was embarrassed in public\" and knew that [0] was doing so. [0] acknowledged the fa\u00e7ade and told a friend that \"[0]'m not [0]. [0] do a lot of things [0] would not do. [0] does not smoke. [0] smoke. [0] does not drink. [0] drink.\" Critic Otis Ferguson, in The New Republic, called [0]: \"common and everyday, not inaccessible, not in a foreign language, not suppressed or sponsored or anything. Just Disney.\" Many of those with whom [0] worked commented that [0] gave [0]'s staff little encouragement due to [0]'s exceptionally high expectations. Norman recalls that when [0] said \"That'll work\", said was an indication of high praise. Instead of direct approval, [0] gave high-performing staff financial bonuses, or recommended certain individuals to others, expecting that [0]'s praise would be passed on."}, "Reputation": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. Views of [0] and his work have changed over the decades, and there have been polarized opinions. Mark Langer, in the American Dictionary of National Biography, writes that \"Earlier evaluations of [0] hailed [0] as a patriot, folk artist, and popularizer of culture. More recently, [0] has been regarded as a paradigm of American imperialism and intolerance, as well as a debaser of culture.\" Steven Watts wrote that some denounce [0] \"as a cynical manipulator of cultural and commercial formulas\", while PBS records that critics have censured his work because of his work's \"smooth fa\u00e7ade of sentimentality and stubborn optimism, his work's feel-good re-write of American history\".[0] has been accused of antisemitism for having given Nazi propagandist Leni Riefenstahl a tour of his studio a month after Kristallnacht. [0] disavowed a tour of his studio three months later, saying [0] was unaware who Nazi propagandist Leni Riefenstahl was when [0] received the invitation. None of [0]'s employees\u2014including the animator Art Babbitt, who disliked [0] intensely\u2014ever accused [0] of making antisemitic slurs or taunts. The Walt Disney Family Museum acknowledges that ethnic stereotypes common to films of the 1930s were included in some early cartoons[aa] but also points out that [0] donated regularly to Jewish charities, was named \"1955 Man of the Year\" by the B'nai B'rith chapter in Beverly Hills, and his studio employed a number of Jews, some of whom were in influential positions.[ab] Gabler, the first writer to gain unrestricted access to the Disney archives, concludes that the available evidence does not support accusations of antisemitism and that [0] was \"not [anti-Semitic] in the conventional sense that we think of someone as being an anti-Semite\". positions.[ab] Gabler, the first writer to gain unrestricted access to the Disney archives, concludes that \"though [0], in positions.[ab] Gabler, the first writer to gain unrestricted access to the Disney archives,'s estimation, was not anti-Semitic, nevertheless, [0] willingly allied [0] with people who were anti-Semitic [meaning some members of the MPAPAI], and that reputation stuck. [0] was never really able to expunge that reputation throughout [0]'s life.\" [0] distanced [0] from the Motion Picture Alliance in the 1950s. According to Disney's daughter Diane Disney-Miller, Disney's daughter Diane Disney-Miller's dated a Jewish boyfriend for a period of time, to which Disney's daughter Diane Disney-Miller's raised no objections and even reportedly said \"her sister Sharon, [0] think it's wonderful how these Jewish families have accepted her sister Sharon.[0] has also been accused of other forms of racism because some of [0]'s productions released between the 1930s and the 1950s contain racially insensitive material.[ac] The feature film Song of the South was criticized by contemporary film critics, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and others for The feature film Song of the South's perpetuation of black stereotypes, but [0] later campaigned successfully for an Honorary Academy Award for an Honorary Academy Award's star, James Baskett, the first black actor so honored.[ad] Gabler argues that \"[0] was no racist. [0] never, either publicly or privately, made disparaging remarks about blacks or asserted white superiority. Like most white Americans of [0]'s generation, however, [0] was racially insensitive.\" Floyd Norman, the studio's first black animator who worked closely with Disney during the 1950s and 1960s, said, \"Not once did Floyd Norman, the studio's first black animator who worked closely with Disney during the 1950s and 1960s, observe a hint of the racist behavior [0] was often accused of after his death. [0]'s treatment of people\u200d\u2014\u200cand by this Floyd Norman, the studio's first black animator who worked closely with Disney during the 1950s and 1960s, mean all people\u200d\u2014\u200ccan only be called exemplary.\"Watts argues that many of Disney's post-World War II films \"legislated a kind of cultural Marshall Plan. many of Disney's post-World War II films nourished a genial cultural imperialism that magically overran the rest of the globe with the values, expectations, and goods of a prosperous middle-class United States.\" Film historian Jay P. Telotte acknowledges that many see his studio as an \"agent of manipulation and repression\", although Film historian Jay P. Telotte observes that his studio has \"labored throughout his studio's history to link his studio's name with notions of fun, family, and fantasy\". John Tomlinson, in John Tomlinson's study Cultural Imperialism, examines the work of Ariel Dorfman and Armand Mattelart, whose 1971 book Para leer al Pato Donald (transl. How to Read Donald Duck) identifies that there are \"imperialist\u00a0... values 'concealed' behind the innocent, wholesome fa\u00e7ade of the world of Walt Disney\"; \"imperialist\u00a0... values 'concealed' behind the innocent, wholesome fa\u00e7ade of the world of Walt Disney, they argue, is a powerful tool as \"\"imperialist\u00a0... values 'concealed' behind the innocent, wholesome fa\u00e7ade of the world of Walt Disney presents \"imperialist\u00a0... values 'concealed' behind the innocent, wholesome fa\u00e7ade of the world of Walt Disney as harmless fun for consumption by children.\" John Tomlinson views they's argument as flawed, as \"they simply assume that reading American comics, seeing adverts, watching pictures of the affluent\u00a0... ['Yankee'] lifestyle has a direct pedagogic effect\".[0] has been portrayed numerous times in fictional works. H. G. Wells references [0] in H. G. Wells's 1938 novel The Holy Terror, in which World Dictator Rud fears that Donald Duck is meant to lampoon World Dictator Rud. [0] was portrayed by Len Cariou in the 1995 made-for-TV film A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes: The Annette Funicello Story, and by Tom Hanks in the 2013 film Saving Mr. Banks. In 2001, the German author Peter Stephan Jungk published Der K\u00f6nig von Amerika (trans: The King of America), a fictional work of [0]'s later years that re-imagines [0] as a power-hungry racist. The composer Philip Glass later adapted Der K\u00f6nig von Amerika (trans: The King of America) into the opera The Perfect American (2013).Several commentators have described [0] as a cultural icon. On his death, journalism professor Ralph S. Izard comments that the values in Disney's films are those \"considered valuable in American Christian society\", which include \"individualism, decency,\u00a0... love for our fellow man, fair play and toleration\". [0]'s obituary in The Times calls Disney's films \"wholesome, warm-hearted and entertaining\u00a0... of incomparable artistry and of touching beauty\". Journalist Bosley Crowther argues that [0]'s \"achievement as a creator of entertainment for an almost unlimited public and as a highly ingenious merchandiser of [0]'s wares can rightly be compared to the most successful industrialists in history.\" Correspondent Alistair Cooke calls [0] a \"folk-hero\u00a0... the Pied Piper of Hollywood\", while positions.[ab] Gabler, the first writer to gain unrestricted access to the Disney archives, considers [0] \"reshaped the culture and the American consciousness\". In the American Dictionary of National Biography, Langer writes:[0] remains the central figure in the history of animation. Through technological innovations and alliances with governments and corporations, [0] transformed a minor studio in a marginal form of communication into a multinational leisure industry giant. Despite [0]'s critics, [0]'s vision of a modern, corporate utopia as an extension of traditional American values has possibly gained greater currency in the years after his death.
