The Economist describes [0] as \"inventing the modern tabloid\", as [0] developed a pattern for [0]'s newspapers, increasing sports and scandal coverage and adopting eye-catching headlines.[0]'s first foray outside Australia involved the purchase of a controlling interest in the New Zealand daily The Dominion. In January 1964, while touring New Zealand with friends in a rented Morris Minor after sailing across the Tasman, [0] read of a takeover bid for the New Zealand daily The Dominion by the British-based Canadian newspaper magnate Lord Thomson of Fleet.
