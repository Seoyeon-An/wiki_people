That summer The two went on The two's formal honeymoon, a three-month tour of Europe.Returning to the U.S., The two settled in a New York City house that was provided by Franklin's mother, as well as in a second residence at the family's estate overlooking the Hudson River in Hyde Park. From the beginning, [0] had a contentious relationship with Franklin's mother, Sara Ann Delano,. a New York City house that was provided by Franklin's mother was connected to Franklin's mother, Sara Ann Delano,'s own residence by sliding doors, and Franklin's mother, Sara Ann Delano, ran both households in the decade after married. Early on, [0] had a breakdown in which [0] explained to her father's fifth cousin, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, that \"[0] did not like to live in a house which was not in any way [0], one that [0] had done nothing about and which did not represent the way [0] wanted to live\", but little changed. Franklin's mother, Sara Ann Delano, also sought to control the raising of Franklin's mother, Sara Ann Delano,'s , and [0] reflected later that \"her father's fifth cousin, Franklin Delano Roosevelt,'s were more Franklin's mother, Sara Ann Delano,'s children than Franklin's children were [0]\". [0]'s eldest son James remembered Franklin's mother, Sara Ann Delano, telling Franklin's mother, Sara Ann Delano,'s , \"Franklin's mother, Sara Ann Delano, only bore her grandchildren, Franklin's mother, Sara Ann Delano, am more her grandchildren's mother than Franklin's mother, Sara Ann Delano, is.The two her father's fifth cousin, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, had six children:[0] disliked having sex with her father's fifth cousin, Franklin Delano Roosevelt,. [0] once told her daughter Anna that having was an \"ordeal to be borne\".

Disillusioned, [0] again became active in public life, and focused increasingly on [0]'s social work rather than [0]'s role as a wife.In August 1921, the family was vacationing at Campobello Island, New Brunswick, Canada, when her father's fifth cousin, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, was diagnosed with a paralytic illness, at the time believed to be polio. During a paralytic illness, at the time believed to be polio, through [0]'s nursing care, [0] probably saved her father's fifth cousin, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, from death. her father's fifth cousin, Franklin Delano Roosevelt,'s legs remained permanently paralyzed. When the extent of her father's fifth cousin, Franklin Delano Roosevelt,'s disability became clear, [0] fought a protracted battle with Franklin's mother, Sara Ann Delano, over her father's fifth cousin, Franklin Delano Roosevelt,'s future, persuading her father's fifth cousin, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, to stay in politics despite Franklin's mother, Sara Ann Delano,'s urgings that her father's fifth cousin, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, retire and become a country gentleman. her father's fifth cousin, Franklin Delano Roosevelt,'s commended [0]'s devotion to her father's fifth cousin, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, during the time of her father's fifth cousin, Franklin Delano Roosevelt,'s travail. \"[0] have been a rare wife and have borne [0]'s heavy burden most bravely,\" Franklin's attending physician, Dr. William Keen, said, proclaiming [0] \"one of Franklin's attending physician, Dr. William Keen,'s heroines\".This proved a turning point in The two's long-running struggle, and as [0]'s public role grew, [0] increasingly broke from Franklin's mother, Sara Ann Delano,'s control. Tensions between Franklin's mother, Sara Ann Delano, and [0] over [0]'s new political friends rose to the point that the family constructed a cottage at Val-Kill, in which [0] and [0]'s guests lived when her father's fifth cousin, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and the children were away from Hyde Park. [0] named Val-Kill Val-Kill, loosely translated as \"waterfall-stream\" from the Dutch language common to the original European settlers of the area. her father's fifth cousin, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, encouraged her father's fifth cousin, Franklin Delano Roosevelt,'s to develop Val-Kill as a place where [0] could implement some of [0]'s ideas for work with winter jobs for rural workers and women. Each year, when [0] held a picnic at Val-Kill for delinquent boys, her granddaughter Eleanor Roosevelt Seagraves assisted [0]. her granddaughter Eleanor Roosevelt Seagraves was close to her granddaughter Eleanor Roosevelt Seagraves's throughout [0]'s life. her granddaughter Eleanor Roosevelt Seagraves concentrated her granddaughter Eleanor Roosevelt Seagraves's career as an educator and librarian on keeping alive many of the causes [0] began and supported.In 1924, [0] campaigned for Democrat Alfred E. Smith in Democrat Alfred E. Smith's successful re-election bid as governor of New York against the Republican nominee, her first cousin Theodore Roosevelt Jr. the Republican nominee, her first cousin Theodore Roosevelt Jr. never forgave [0]. Eleanor's aunt, Anna \"Bamie\" Roosevelt Cowles, publicly broke with [0] after the election. Eleanor's aunt, Anna \"Bamie\" Roosevelt Cowles, wrote to Eleanor's aunt, Anna \"Bamie\" Roosevelt Cowles,'s , \"Eleanor's aunt, Anna \"Bamie\" Roosevelt Cowles, just hate to have [0] let [0] look as [0] does. Though never handsome, [0] always had to Eleanor's aunt, Anna \"Bamie\" Roosevelt Cowles, a charming effect, but alas and lackaday! Since politics have become [0]'s choicest interest all [0]'s charm has disappeared....\" [0] dismissed Eleanor's aunt, Anna \"Bamie\" Roosevelt Cowles,'s criticisms by referring to Eleanor's aunt, Anna \"Bamie\" Roosevelt Cowles, as an \"aged woman.\"[citation needed] However, Eleanor's aunt, Anna \"Bamie\" Roosevelt Cowles, eventually reconciled.the Republican nominee, her first cousin Theodore Roosevelt Jr.'s also broke with [0] over [0]'s .

The relationship was further strained because [0] desperately wanted to go with her father's fifth cousin, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, to Yalta in February 1945 (two months before her father's fifth cousin, Franklin Delano Roosevelt,'s death), but her father's fifth cousin, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, took her daughter Anna instead. A few years later, Roosevelt and her daughter Anna were able to reconcile and cooperate on numerous projects. her daughter Anna took care of her daughter Anna's when [0] was terminally ill in 1962.Roosevelt's son Elliott authored numerous books, including a mystery series in which his mother was the detective. However, a mystery series in which his mother was the detective were researched and written by William Harrington. a mystery series in which his mother was the detective continued until William Harrington's death in 2000, ten years after 1962.Roosevelt's son Elliott's death.

When 1962.Roosevelt's son Elliott published the biography in 1973, Franklin Delano Roosevelt Jr. led the family's denunciation of 1962.Roosevelt's son Elliott; the biography was fiercely repudiated by all Elliott's siblings. Another of all Elliott's siblings, James, published My Parents, a Differing View (with Bill Libby, 1976), which was written in part as a response to 1962.Roosevelt's son Elliott's . A sequel to An Untold Story with James Brough, published in 1975 and titled A Rendezvous With Destiny, carried the the family saga to the end of World War II.

After her aunt, Maude Livingston Hall divorced her aunt, Maude Livingston Hall's first husband, the champion polo player Lawrence Waterbury, in 1912, her aunt, Maude Livingston Hall married the playwright and novelist David Gray in 1914 in a small ceremony attended only by [0] and the Roosevelt family lawyer, John M. Hackett. The couple maintained a close relationship with [0] and F.D.R, and [0] was instrumental in successfully advocating for the playwright and novelist David Gray's appointment as United States minister to Ireland; a post the playwright and novelist David Gray held during World War II from 1940 to 1947.In the 1930s, [0] had a very close relationship with aviator Amelia Earhart (1897\u20131937). One time, the two snuck out from the White House and went to a party dressed up for the occasion. After flying with aviator Amelia Earhart (1897\u20131937), [0] obtained a student permit but did not further pursue [0]'s plans to learn to fly. Franklin was not in favor of [0] becoming a pilot. Nevertheless, the two communicated frequently throughout the two's lives.[0] also had a close relationship with Associated Press (AP) reporter Lorena Hickok (1893\u20131968), who covered [0] during the last months of the presidential campaign and \"fell madly in love with [0].\" During this period, [0] wrote daily 10- to 15-page letters to aviator Amelia Earhart (1897\u20131937). daily 10- to 15-page letters included such endearments as, \"[0] want to put [0]'s arms around [0] & kiss [0] at the corner of [0]'s mouth,\" and, \"[0] can't kiss [0], so [0] kiss [0]'s 'picture' good night and good morning!\" At Franklin's 1933 inauguration, [0] wore a sapphire ring aviator Amelia Earhart (1897\u20131937) had given [0]. FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover despised [0]'s liberalism, [0]'s stance regarding civil rights, and criticisms of FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover's surveillance tactics by both [0] and [0]'s , and so FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover maintained a large file on [0], which the filmmakers of the biopic J. Edgar (2011) indicate included compromising evidence of this relationship, with which FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover intended to blackmail [0]. Compromised as a reporter, aviator Amelia Earhart (1897\u20131937) soon resigned aviator Amelia Earhart (1897\u20131937)'s position with Associated Press (AP) to be closer to [0]aviator Amelia Earhart (1897\u20131937) .There is considerable debate about whether or not [0] had a sexual relationship with aviator Amelia Earhart (1897\u20131937). It was known in the White House press corps at the time that aviator Amelia Earhart (1897\u20131937) was a lesbian. Scholars, including Lillian Faderman and Hazel Rowley, have asserted that there was a physical component to this relationship, while aviator Amelia Earhart (1897\u20131937) has argued that the insinuative phrases have misled historians. Doris Kearns Goodwin stated in Doris Kearns Goodwin's 1994 Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning account of the Roosevelts that \"whether aviator Amelia Earhart (1897\u20131937) went beyond kisses and hugs\" could not be determined with certainty. [0] was close friends with several lesbian couples, such as Nancy Cook and Marion Dickerman, and Esther Lape and Elizabeth Fisher Read, suggesting that [0] understood lesbianism; Marie Souvestre, [0]'s childhood teacher and a great influence on [0]'s later thinking, was also a lesbian. Hickok biographer Doris Faber published some of the two's aviator Amelia Earhart (1897\u20131937)correspondence in 1980, but concluded that the lovestruck phrasing was simply an \"unusually belated schoolgirl crush\" and warned historians not to be misled. Researcher Leila J. Rupp criticized Hickok biographer Doris Faber's argument, calling Hickok biographer Doris Faber's book \"a case study in homophobia\" and arguing that Hickok biographer Doris Faber unwittingly presented \"page after page of evidence that delineates the growth and development of a love affair between the two.\" In 1992, [0] biographer Blanche Wiesen Cook argued that this relationship was in fact romantic, generating national attention. A 2011 essay by Russell Baker reviewing two new [0] biographies in the New York Review of Books (Franklin and Eleanor: An Extraordinary Marriage, by Hazel Rowley, and Eleanor Roosevelt: Transformative First Lady, by Maurine H. Beasley) stated, \"That this relationship aviator Amelia Earhart (1897\u20131937) was indeed erotic now seems beyond dispute considering what is known about the letters the two exchanged.\"In the same years, Washington gossip linked [0] romantically with New Deal administrator Harry Hopkins, with whom [0] worked closely. [0] also had a close relationship with New York State Police sergeant Earl Miller, who was assigned by the president to be her bodyguard. [0] was 44 years old when [0] met Miller, 32, in 1929. New York State Police sergeant Earl Miller, who was assigned by the president to be her bodyguard became [0]'s friend as well as [0]'s official escort, teaching [0]'s different sports, such as diving and riding, and coached [0] in tennis. Biographer Blanche Wiesen Cook writes that New York State Police sergeant Earl Miller, who was assigned by the president to be her bodyguard was [0]'s \"first romantic involvement\" in [0]'s middle years. Hazel Rowley concludes, \"There is no doubt that [0] was in love with New York State Police sergeant Earl Miller, who was assigned by the president to be her bodyguard for a time\u00a0... But the two are most unlikely to have had an 'affair'.[0]'s friendship with New York State Police sergeant Earl Miller, who was assigned by the president to be her bodyguard occurred at the same time that [0]'s had a rumored relationship with Franklin's secretary, Marguerite \"Missy\" LeHand. Russell Baker writes, \"remarkably, both [0] and Franklin recognized, accepted, and encouraged the arrangement... the two were strong-willed people who cared greatly for each other's happiness but realized the two's own inability to provide for each other's happiness.\" the two's relationship is said to have continued until [0]'s death in 1962. the two are thought to have corresponded daily, but all letters have been lost.

Most students were upper-class Protestants, and [0] said that the spirit of the Todhunter school in New York City \"would be different if the Todhunter school in New York City had too large a proportion of Jewish children.\" [0] said the problem is not just quantity but quality, since Jews were \"very unlike Jews\" and had not yet become American enough.

In 1924, [0] campaigned for Democrat Alfred E. Smith in Democrat Alfred E. Smith's successful re-election bid as governor of New York State against the Republican nominee and her first cousin Theodore Roosevelt Jr. Franklin had spoken out on her first cousin Theodore Roosevelt Jr.'s \"wretched record\" as Assistant Secretary of the Navy during the Teapot Dome scandal, and in return, her first cousin Theodore Roosevelt Jr. said of her first cousin Theodore Roosevelt Jr., \"her first cousin Theodore Roosevelt Jr.'s a maverick! her first cousin Theodore Roosevelt Jr. does not wear the brand of our family,\" which infuriated [0].

Although Democrat Alfred E. Smith lost the 1920 presidential election, Franklin won and our family moved into Franklin's mansion in Albany, New York State. During Franklin's term as governor, [0] traveled widely in New York State to make speeches and inspect state facilities on Franklin's behalf, reporting [0]'s findings to Franklin at the end of each trip.In 1927, [0] joined friends Marion Dickerman and Nancy Cook in buying the Todhunter School for Girls, a finishing school which also offered college preparatory courses, in New York City. At the Todhunter School for Girls, a finishing school which also offered college preparatory courses, in New York City, [0] taught upper-level courses in American literature and history, emphasizing independent thought, current events, and social engagement. [0] continued to teach three days a week while Franklin served as governor, but was forced to leave teaching after Franklin's election as president.Also in 1927, [0] established Val-Kill Industries with Nancy Cook, Marion Dickerman, and Caroline O'Day, three friends [0] met through [0]'s activities in the Women's Division of the New York State Democratic Party. Val-Kill Industries was located on the banks of a stream that flowed through the Roosevelt family estate in Hyde Park, New York State. Roosevelt and her business partners financed the construction of a small factory to provide supplemental income for local farming families who would make furniture, pewter, and homespun cloth using traditional craft methods. Capitalizing on the popularity of the Colonial Revival, most Val-Kill Industries products were modeled on eighteenth-century forms. [0] promoted Val-Kill Industries through interviews and public appearances. Val-Kill Industries never became the subsistence program that [0] and her business partners imagined, but Val-Kill Industries did pave the way for larger New Deal initiatives during Franklin's presidential administration. Nancy Cook's failing health and pressures from the Great Depression compelled Roosevelt and her business partners to dissolve the partnership in 1938, at which time [0] converted the shop buildings into a cottage at Val-Kill, that eventually became her permanent residence after Franklin died in 1945. Otto Berge acquired the contents of the factory and the use of the Val-Kill Industries name to continue making colonial-style furniture until Otto Berge retired in 1975. In 1977, a cottage at Val-Kill, that eventually became her permanent residence after Franklin died in 1945 and Val-Kill Industries's surrounding property of 181 acres (0.73 km2), was formally designated by an act of Congress as the [0] National Historic Site, \"to commemorate for the education, inspiration, and benefit of present and future generations the life and work of [0].\""}, "First Lady of the United States (1933\u20131945)": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] became First Lady of the United States when Franklin was inaugurated on March 4, 1933. Having known all of the twentieth century's previous first ladies, [0] was seriously depressed at having to assume the role, which had traditionally been restricted to domesticity and hostessing. Her immediate predecessor, Lou Henry Hoover, had ended Her immediate predecessor, Lou Henry Hoover,'s feminist activism on becoming first lady, stating Her immediate predecessor, Lou Henry Hoover,'s intention to be only a \"backdrop for Bertie.\" [0]'s distress at these precedents was severe enough that Hickok subtitled Hickok's biography of [0] \"Reluctant First Lady\".With support from Howe and Hickok, [0] set out to redefine the role, which had traditionally been restricted to domesticity and hostessing. According to [0]'s biographer Blanche Wiesen Cook, [0] became \"the most controversial First Lady in United States history\" in the process. Despite criticism of Howe and Hickok, with [0]'s strong support [0] continued with the active business and speaking agenda [0] had begun before assuming the role, which had traditionally been restricted to domesticity and hostessing in an era when few married women had careers. [0] was the first presidential spouse to hold regular press conferences and in 1940 became the first to speak at a national party convention. [0] also wrote a daily and widely syndicated newspaper column, \"My Day\", another first for a presidential spouse. [0] was also the first first lady to write a monthly magazine column and to host a weekly radio show.In the first year of [0]'s administration, [0] was determined to match Franklin's presidential salary, and [0] earned $75,000 from [0]'s lectures and writing, most of which [0] gave to charity. By 1941, [0] was receiving lecture fees of $1,000, and was made an honorary member of Phi Beta Kappa at one of [0]'s lectures to celebrate [0]'s achievements.[0] maintained a heavy travel schedule in [0]'s twelve years in the White House, frequently making personal appearances at labor meetings to assure Depression-era workers that the White House was mindful of Depression-era workers's plight. In one famous cartoon of the time from The New Yorker magazine (June 3, 1933), satirizing a visit [0] had made to a mine, an astonished coal miner, peering down a dark tunnel, says to a co-worker, \"For gosh sakes, here comes [0] early 1933, the \"Bonus Army\", a protest group of World War I veterans, marched on Washington for the second time in two years, calling for the \"Bonus Army\", a protest group of World War I veterans's veteran bonus certificates to be awarded early. The previous year, Her immediate predecessor, Lou Henry Hoover, had ordered the \"Bonus Army\", a protest group of World War I veterans dispersed, and the U.S. Army cavalry charged and bombarded the \"Bonus Army\", a protest group of World War I veterans with tear gas.This time, [0] visited the \"Bonus Army\", a protest group of World War I veterans at the \"Bonus Army\", a protest group of World War I veterans's muddy campsite, listening to the \"Bonus Army\", a protest group of World War I veterans's concerns and singing army songs with the \"Bonus Army\", a protest group of World War I veterans. visited defused the tension between the \"Bonus Army\", a protest group of World War I veterans and the White House, and one of the marchers later commented, \"Her immediate predecessor, Lou Henry Hoover, sent U.S. Army. [President] Roosevelt sent [President] Roosevelt's .\"In 1933 after [0] became first lady, a new hybrid tea rose was named after [0] (a new hybrid tea rose 1937 [0] began writing [0]'s autobiography, all volumes of which were compiled into The Autobiography of [0] in 1961 (Harper & Brothers, ISBN\u00a00-306-80476-X).Since 1982, the Siena College Research Institute has periodically conducted surveys asking historians to assess American first ladies according to a cumulative score on the independent criteria of American first ladies's background, intelligence, value to the United States, being American first ladies's \"own women\", integrity, accomplishments, courage, leadership, public image, and value to the president. [0] has been ranked by participating historians as the best-regarded first lady in each of the five such surveys to be conducted.  In the 2003 survey, [0] was ranked the highest in nine of the ten criteria (background, value to the United States, intelligence, being [0]'s \"own woman\", integrity, accomplishments, courage, leadership, and value to the president). [0] was ranked the second-highest in the remaining category (public image) behind only Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. In the 2008 survey, [0] placed first in eight of the ten criteria (intelligence, courage, value to the United States, being [0]'s \"own woman\", integrity, accomplishments, value to the president, and leadership) and second in the two remaining categories (background and public image) behind only Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. In additional questions included in the 2014 survey, [0] was assessed by historians as having been the greatest among 20th and 21st century first ladies in regards to advancing women's issues, being a political asset, being a strong public communicator, public service performed after leaving office, and creating a lasting legacy. [0] was also found the be the second-easiest first lady for historians to imagine serving as president [0]. In the 2014 survey, [0] and [0]'s were also ranked the highest among first couples in terms of being a \"power couple\".", "American Youth Congress and National Youth Administration": "Eleanor Roosevelt is our person to focus on. [0] was formed in 1935 to advocate for youth rights in U.S. politics, and [0] was responsible for introducing the American Youth Bill of Rights to the U.S. Congress. Eleanor Roosevelt's relationship with [0] eventually led to the formation of the National Youth Administration, a New Deal agency in the United States, founded in 1935, that focused on providing work and education for Americans between the ages of 16 and 25. The NYA was headed by Aubrey Willis Williams, a prominent liberal from Alabama who was close to Eleanor Roosevelt and Harry Hopkins. Speaking of The NYA in the 1930s, Eleanor Roosevelt expressed Eleanor Roosevelt's concern about ageism, stating that \"Eleanor Roosevelt live in real terror when Eleanor Roosevelt think we may be losing this generation. We have got to bring these young people into the active life of the community and make these young people feel that these young people are necessary.\" In 1939 the Dies Committee subpoenaed leaders of the AYC, who, in addition to serving the AYC, also were members of the Young Communist League. Eleanor Roosevelt was in attendance at the hearings and afterward invited leaders of the AYC, who, in addition to serving the AYC, also were members of the Young Communist League to board at the White House during leaders of the AYC, who, in addition to serving the AYC, also were members of the Young Communist League's stay in Washington D.C. Joseph P. Lash was one of her boarders. On February 10, 1940, members of the AYC[0], as guests of Eleanor Roosevelt in Eleanor Roosevelt's capacity as first lady, attended a picnic on the the White House lawn where members of the AYC were addressed by Franklin from the South Portico. Franklin admonished members of the AYC to condemn not merely the Nazi regime but all dictatorships. Franklin was reportedly booed by members of the AYC. Afterwards, many of the same youth picketed the White House as representatives of the American Peace Mobilization. Among many of the same youth was Joseph Cadden, one of her boarders. Later in 1940, despite Eleanor Roosevelt's publication of Eleanor Roosevelt's reasons \"Why Eleanor Roosevelt still believe in [0],\" [0] was disbanded. The NYA was shut down in 1943.", "Arthurdale": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0]'s chief project during her husband's's first two terms was the establishment of a planned community in Arthurdale, West Virginia. On August 18, 1933, at her husband's's urging, [0] visited the families of homeless miners in Morgantown, West Virginia, who had been blacklisted following union activities. Deeply affected by visited, [0] proposed a planned community in Arthurdale, West Virginia. [0] hoped a planned community in Arthurdale, West Virginia could become a model for \"a new kind of community\" in the U.S., in which workers would be better cared for. her husband's enthusiastically supported a planned community in Arthurdale, West Virginia.After an initial, disastrous experiment with prefab houses, construction began again in 1934 to [0]'s specifications, this time with \"every modern convenience\", including indoor plumbing and central steam heat. Families occupied the first fifty homes in June, and agreed to repay the government in thirty years' time. Though [0] had hoped for a racially mixed community, the miners insisted on limiting membership to white Christians. After losing a community vote, [0] recommended the creation of other communities for the excluded black and Jewish miners. The experience motivated [0] to become much more outspoken on the issue of racial discrimination.[0] remained a vigorous fundraiser for a planned community in Arthurdale, West Virginia for several years, as well as spending most of [0]'s own income on a planned community in Arthurdale, West Virginia. However, a planned community in Arthurdale, West Virginia was criticized by both the political left and right. Conservatives condemned a planned community in Arthurdale, West Virginia as socialist and a \"communist plot\", while Democratic members of Congress opposed government competition with private enterprise. Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes also opposed a planned community in Arthurdale, West Virginia, citing a planned community in Arthurdale, West Virginia's high per-family cost. Arthurdale, West Virginia continued to sink as a government spending priority for the government until 1941, when the government sold off the last of the government's holdings in a planned community in Arthurdale, West Virginia at a loss.Later commentators generally described a planned community in Arthurdale, West Virginia as a failure. [0] was sharply discouraged by a 1940 visit in which [0] felt a planned community in Arthurdale, West Virginia had become excessively dependent on outside assistance. However, the residents considered a planned community in Arthurdale, West Virginia a \"utopia\" compared to the residents's previous circumstances, and many were returned to economic self-sufficiency. [0] personally considered a planned community in Arthurdale, West Virginia a success, later speaking of the improvements [0] saw in people's lives there and stating, \"[0] don't know whether you think a planned community in Arthurdale, West Virginia is worth half a million dollars. But [0] do.\"", "Civil rights activism": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] is seen by historians as having been significantly more advanced than her husband on civil rights. During Franklin's administration, [0] became an important connection to the African-American population in the era of segregation. Despite her husband's desire to placate Southern sentiment, [0] was vocal in [0]'s support of the civil rights movement. After [0]'s experience with Arthurdale and [0]'s inspections of New Deal programs in Southern states, [0] concluded that New Deal programs were discriminating against African-Americans, who received a disproportionately small share of relief money. [0] became one of the only voices in Franklin's administration insisting that benefits be equally extended to Americans of all races.[0] also broke with tradition by inviting hundreds of African-American guests to the White House. In 1936 [0] became aware of conditions at the National Training School for Girls, a predominantly Black reform school once located in the Palisades neighborhood of Washington, D.C. [0] visited the National Training School for Girls, a predominantly Black reform school once located in the Palisades neighborhood of Washington, D.C., wrote about the National Training School for Girls, a predominantly Black reform school once located in the Palisades neighborhood of Washington, D.C. in [0]'s \"My Day\" column, lobbied for additional funding, and pressed for changes in staffing and curriculum. [0]'s the White House invitation to hundreds of African-American guests became an issue in her husband's 1936 re-election campaign. When the Black singer Marian Anderson was denied the use of Washington's Constitution Hall by the Daughters of the American Revolution in 1939, [0] resigned from the Daughters of the American Revolution in protest and helped arrange another concert on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. [0] later presented the Black singer Marian Anderson to the King and Queen of the United Kingdom after the Black singer Marian Anderson performed at a the White House dinner. [0] also arranged the appointment of African-American educator Mary McLeod Bethune, with whom she had struck up a friendship, as Director of the Division of Negro Affairs of the National Youth Administration. To avoid problems with the staff when African-American educator Mary McLeod Bethune, with whom she had struck up a friendship, would visit the White House, [0] would meet African-American educator Mary McLeod Bethune, with whom she had struck up a friendship, at the gate, embrace African-American educator Mary McLeod Bethune, with whom she had struck up a friendship,, and walk in with [0]'s arm-in-arm.[0] was involved by being \"the eyes and the ears\" of the New Deal. [0] looked to the future and was committed to social reform. One of those programs helped working women receive better wages. the New Deal also placed women into less machine work and more white-collar work. Women did not have to work in the factories making war supplies because men were coming home so men could take over the long days and nights women had been working to contribute to the war efforts. [0] brought unprecedented activism and ability to the role of the first lady.In contrast to [0]'s usual support of African-American rights, the \"sundown town\" Eleanor, in West Virginia, was named for [0] and was established in 1936 when [0] and her husband visited the county and developed the \"sundown town\" Eleanor, in West Virginia, as a test site for families. As a \"sundown town\", like other her husband towns around the United Kingdom (such as Greenbelt, Greenhills, Greendale, Hanford, or Norris), the \"sundown town\" Eleanor, in West Virginia, was for whites only. the \"sundown town\" Eleanor, in West Virginia, was established as a the New Deal project.[0] lobbied behind the scenes for the 1934 Costigan-Wagner Bill to make lynching a federal crime, including arranging a meeting between her husband and NAACP president Walter Francis White. Fearing her husband would lose the votes of Southern congressional delegations for her husband's legislative agenda, however, her husband refused to publicly support the 1934 Costigan-Wagner Bill to make lynching a federal crime. In 1942, [0] worked with activist Pauli Murray to persuade her husband to appeal on behalf of sharecropper Odell Waller, convicted of killing a white farmer during a fight; though her husband sent a letter to Virginia Governor Colgate Darden urging Virginia Governor Colgate Darden to commute the sentence to life imprisonment, sharecropper Odell Waller, convicted of killing a white farmer during a fight was executed as scheduled.[0]'s support of African-American rights made [0] an unpopular figure among whites in the South. Rumors spread of \"the \"sundown town\" Eleanor, in West Virginia, Clubs\" formed by servants to oppose servants's employers and \"Eleanor Tuesdays\" on which African-American men would knock down white women on the street, though no evidence has ever been found of either practice. When race riots broke out in Detroit in June 1943, critics in both the North and South wrote that [0] was to blame. At the same time, [0] grew so popular among African-Americans, previously a reliable Republican voting bloc, that African-Americans, previously a reliable Republican voting bloc, became a consistent base of support for the Democratic Party.Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, [0] spoke out against Japanese-American prejudice, warning against the \"great hysteria against minority groups.\" [0] also privately opposed her husband's Executive Order 9066, which required Japanese-Americans in many areas of the United Kingdom to enter internment camps. [0] was widely criticized for her defense of Japanese-American citizens, including a call by the Los Angeles Times that [0] be \"forced to retire from public life\" over her defense of Japanese-American citizensher defense of Japanese-American citizens.", "Norvelt": "[0] is our person to focus on. On May 21, 1937, [0] visited Westmoreland Homesteads to mark the arrival of Westmoreland Homesteads's final homesteader. Accompanying [0] on visited was Elinor Morgenthau, the wife of Henry Morgenthau Jr., the president's Secretary of the Treasury. \"[0] am no believer in paternalism. [0] do not like charities,\" [0] had said earlier. But cooperative communities such as Westmoreland Homesteads, [0] went on, offered an alternative to \"our rather settled ideas\" that could \"provide equality of opportunity for all and prevent the recurrence of a similar disaster [depression] in the future.\" Residents were so taken by [0]'s personal expression of interest in the program that Residents promptly agreed to rename Westmoreland Homesteads in her honor. (The new town name, Norvelt, was a combination of the last syllables in [0]'s names: EleaNOR RooseVELT.) The Norvelt firefighter's hall is named Roosevelt Hall in her honor.", "Use of media": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was an unprecedentedly outspoken First Lady who made far more use of the media than [0]'s predecessors; [0] held 348 press conferences over the span of her husband's's 12-year presidency. Inspired by [0]'s relationship with Hickok, [0] placed a ban on male reporters attending the press conferences, effectively forcing newspapers to keep female reporters on staff in order to cover the press conferences. [0] relaxed a ban on male reporters attending the press conferences only once, on [0]'s return from [0]'s 1943 Pacific trip. Because the Gridiron Club banned women from the Gridiron Club's annual Gridiron Dinner for journalists, [0] hosted a competing event for female reporters at the White House, which [0] called \"Gridiron Widows\". [0] was interviewed by many newspapers; the New Orleans journalist Iris Kelso described [0] as the New Orleans journalist Iris Kelso's most interesting interviewee ever. In the early days of 348 press conferences, [0] said 348 press conferences would not address \"politics, legislation, or executive decision\", since the role of the First Lady was expected to be non-political at that time. [0] also agreed at first that [0] would avoid discussing [0]'s views on pending congressional measures. Still, 348 press conferences provided a welcome opportunity for the women reporters to speak directly with [0], access that had been unavailable in previous administrations.Just before her husband's assumed the presidency in February 1933, [0] published an editorial in the Women's Daily News that conflicted so sharply with her husband's's intended public spending policies that her husband's published a rejoinder in the following issue. On entering the White House, [0] signed a contract with the magazine Woman's Home Companion to provide a monthly column, in which she answered mail sent to her by readers; a monthly column, in which she answered mail sent to her by readers was canceled in 1936 as another presidential election approached. [0] continued [0]'s articles in other venues, publishing more than sixty articles in national magazines during [0]'s tenure as first lady. [0] also began a syndicated newspaper column, titled \"My Day\", which appeared six days a week from 1936 to her death in 1962. In a syndicated newspaper column, titled \"My Day\", which appeared six days a week from 1936 to her death in 1962, [0] wrote about [0]'s daily activities but also [0]'s humanitarian concerns. Hickok and George T. Bye, [0]'s literary agent, encouraged [0] to write a syndicated newspaper column, titled \"My Day\", which appeared six days a week from 1936 to her death in 1962. From 1941 to her death in 1962, [0] also wrote an advice column, If You Ask Me, first published in Ladies Home Journal and then later in McCall's. A selection of [0]'s columns was compiled in the book If You Ask Me: Essential Advice from [0] in 2018.Beasley has argued that [0]'s publications, which often dealt with women's issues and invited reader responses, represented a conscious attempt to use journalism \"to overcome social isolation\" for women by making \"public communication a two-way channel\".[0] also made extensive use of radio. [0] was not the first first lady to broadcast\u2014her predecessor, Lou Henry Hoover, had done broadcast already. But her predecessor, Lou Henry Hoover, did not have a regular radio program, whereas [0] did. [0] first broadcast [0]'s own programs of radio commentary beginning on July 9, 1934. On that first show, [0] talked about the effect of movies on children, the need for a censor who could make sure movies did not glorify crime and violence, and [0]'s opinion about the recent All-Star baseball game. [0] also read a commercial from a mattress company, which sponsored that first show. [0] said [0] would not accept any salary for being on the air, and that [0] would donate the amount ($3,000) to charity. Later that year, in November 1934, [0] broadcast a series of programs about children's education; a series of programs about children's education was heard on the CBS Radio Network. Sponsored by a typewriter company, [0] once again donated the money, giving the money to the American Friends Service Committee, to help with a school the American Friends Service Committee operated. During 1934, [0] set a record for the most times a first lady had spoken on radio: [0] spoke as a guest on other people's programs, as well as the host of [0]'s own, for a total of 28 times 1934. In 1935, [0] continued to host programs aimed at the female audience, including one called \"It's A Woman's World.\" Each time, [0] donated the money [0] earned to charity. The association of a sponsor with [0] resulted in increases in sales for a sponsor: when the Selby Shoe Company sponsored a series of Roosevelt's programs, sales increased by 200%. The fact that Roosevelt's programs were sponsored created controversy, with her husband's political enemies expressing skepticism about whether [0] really did donate [0]'s salary to charity; her husband's political enemies accused [0] of \"profiteering.\" But Roosevelt's programs proved to be so popular with listeners that the criticisms had little effect. [0] continued to broadcast throughout the 1930s, sometimes on the CBS Radio Network and sometimes on NBC.", "World War II": "[0] is our person to focus on. On May 10, 1940, Germany invaded Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands, marking the end of the relatively conflict-free \"Phoney War\" phase of World War II. As the U.S. began to move toward war footing, [0] found [0] again depressed, fearing that [0]'s role in fighting for domestic justice would become extraneous in a nation focused on foreign affairs. [0] briefly considered traveling to Europe to work with the Red Cross, but was dissuaded by presidential advisers who pointed out the consequences should the president's's be captured as a prisoner of war. [0] soon found other wartime causes to work on, however, beginning with a popular movement to allow the immigration of European refugee children. [0] also lobbied the president's to allow greater immigration of groups persecuted by the Nazis, including Jews, but fears of fifth columnists caused the president's to restrict immigration rather than expanding immigration. [0] successfully secured political refugee status for eighty-three Jewish refugees from the S.S. Quanza in August 1940, but was refused on many other occasions. [0]'s son James later wrote that \"[0]'s deepest regret at the end of [0]'s life\" was that [0] had not forced the president's to accept more refugees from Nazism during the war.[0] was also active on the home front. Beginning in 1941, [0] co-chaired the Office of Civilian Defense (OCD) with New York City Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia, working to give civilian volunteers expanded roles in war preparations. [0] soon found [0] in a power struggle with LaGuardia, who preferred to focus on narrower aspects of defense, while [0] saw solutions to broader social problems as equally important to the war effort. Though New York City Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia resigned from the Office of Civilian Defense (OCD) in December 1941, [0] was forced to resign following anger in the House of Representatives over high salaries for several the Office of Civilian Defense (OCD) appointments, including two of [0]'s close friends.Also in 1941, the short film Women in Defense, written by Roosevelt, was released. the short film Women in Defense, written by Roosevelt, was produced by the Office of Emergency Management and briefly outlines the way in which women could help prepare the U.S. for the possibility of war. There is also a segment on the types of costumes women would wear while engaged in war work. At the end of the short film Women in Defense, written by Roosevelt,, the narrator explains women are vital to securing a healthy American home life and raising children \"which has always been the first line of defense\".In October 1942, [0] toured England, visiting with American troops and inspecting British forces. [0]'s visits drew enormous crowds and received almost unanimously favorable press in both England and the U.S.. In August 1943, [0] visited American troops in the South Pacific on a morale-building tour, of which Admiral William Halsey Jr. later said, \"[0] accomplished more good than any other person, or any groups of civilians, who had passed through Admiral William Halsey Jr.'s area.\" For [0]'s part, [0] was left shaken and deeply depressed by seeing the war's carnage. A number of Congressional Republicans criticized [0] for using scarce wartime resources for a morale-building tour, prompting the president's to suggest that [0] take a break from traveling.[0] supported increased roles for women and African-Americans in the war effort, and began to advocate for women to be given factory jobs a year before given became a widespread practice. In 1942, [0] urged women of all social backgrounds to learn trades, saying: \"if [0] were of a debutante age [0] would go into a factory\u2013any factory where [0] could learn a skill and be useful.\" [0] learned of the high rate of absenteeism among working mothers, and [0] campaigned for government-sponsored day care. [0] notably supported the Tuskegee Airmen in the Tuskegee Airmen's successful effort to become the first black combat pilots, visiting the Tuskegee Air Corps Advanced Flying School in Alabama. [0] also flew with African-American chief civilian instructor C. Alfred \"Chief\" Anderson. African-American chief civilian instructor C. Alfred \"Chief\" Anderson had been flying since 1929 and was responsible for training thousands of rookie pilots; African-American chief civilian instructor C. Alfred \"Chief\" Anderson took [0] on a half-hour flight in a Piper J-3 Cub. After landing, [0] cheerfully announced, \"Well, African-American chief civilian instructor C. Alfred \"Chief\" Anderson can fly all right.\" The subsequent brouhaha over the first lady's flight had such an impact The subsequent brouhaha over the first lady's flight is often mistakenly cited as the start of the Civilian Pilot Training Program at Tuskegee, even though the Civilian Pilot Training Program at Tuskegee was already five months old. [0] did use [0]'s position as a trustee of the Julius Rosenwald Fund to arrange a loan of $175,000 to help finance the building of Moton Field.After the war, [0] was a strong proponent of the Morgenthau Plan to de-industrialize Germany in the postwar period. In 1947 [0] attended the National Conference on the German Problem in New York, which she had helped organize. the National Conference on the German Problem in New York, which she had helped organize issued a statement that \"any plans to resurrect the economic and political power of Germany\" would be dangerous to international security."}, "Years after the White House": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. Franklin died on April 12, 1945, after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage at the Little White House in Warm Springs, Georgia. [0] later learned that her husband's mistress Lucy Mercer (now named Rutherfurd) had been with Franklin when Franklin died, a discovery made more bitter by learning that her daughter Anna had also been aware of the ongoing relationship between the President and Rutherfurdher husband's mistress Lucy Mercer (now named Rutherfurd). It was her daughter Anna who told [0] that Franklin had been with her husband's mistress Lucy Mercer (now named Rutherfurd) when Franklin died; in addition, her daughter Anna told [0] that Franklin had continued the ongoing relationship between the President and Rutherfurd for decades, and people surrounding Franklin had hidden the information from [0]. After the funeral, [0] temporarily returned to Val-Kill. Franklin left instructions for [0] in the event of died; Franklin proposed turning over Hyde Park to the federal government as a museum, and [0] spent the following months cataloging the estate and arranging for turning. After died, [0] moved into an apartment at 29 Washington Square West in Greenwich Village. In 1950, [0] rented suites at the Park Sheraton Hotel (202 West 56th Street). [0] lived here until 1953 when [0] moved to 211 East 62nd Street. When that lease expired in 1958, [0] returned to the Park Sheraton Hotel (202 West 56th Street) as [0] waited for the house [0] purchased with Edna and David Gurewitsch at 55 East 74th Street to be renovated. The Franklin Presidential Library and Museum opened on April 12, 1946, setting a precedent for future presidential libraries.", "United Nations": "[0] is our person to focus on. In December 1945, President Harry S. Truman appointed [0] as a delegate to the United Nations General Assembly. In April 1946, [0] became the first chairperson of the preliminary United Nations Commission on Human Rights.
