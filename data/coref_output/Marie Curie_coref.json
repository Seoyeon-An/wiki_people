[0] is the subject of numerous biographical works."}, "Life and career": {"Early years": "[0]\u00a0 is our person to focus on. [0] was born in Warsaw, in Congress Poland in the Russian Empire, on 7 November 1867, the fifth and youngest child of well-known teachers Bronis\u0142awa, n\u00e9e Boguska, and W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sk\u0142odowski. The elder siblings of Maria (nicknamed Mania) were Zofia (born 1862, nicknamed Zosia), J\u00f3zef\u00a0[pl] (born 1863, nicknamed J\u00f3zio), Bronis\u0142awa (born 1865, nicknamed Bronia) and Helena (born 1866, nicknamed Hela).On both the paternal and maternal sides, the family had lost the family's property and fortunes through patriotic involvements in Polish national uprisings aimed at restoring Poland's independence (the most recent had been the January Uprising of 1863\u201365). lost condemned the subsequent generation, including [0] and The elder siblings of Maria (nicknamed Mania), to a difficult struggle to get ahead in life. Maria's paternal grandfather, J\u00f3zef Sk\u0142odowski\u00a0[pl], had been principal of the Lublin primary school attended by Boles\u0142aw Prus, who became a leading figure in Polish literature.Maria's paternal grandfather, J\u00f3zef Sk\u0142odowski\u00a0[pl], taught mathematics and physics, subjects that [0] was to pursue, and was also director of two Warsaw, in Congress Poland in the Russian Empire, gymnasia (secondary schools) for boys. After Russian authorities eliminated laboratory instruction from the Polish schools, Maria's paternal grandfather, J\u00f3zef Sk\u0142odowski\u00a0[pl], brought much of the laboratory equipment home and instructed Maria's paternal grandfather, J\u00f3zef Sk\u0142odowski\u00a0[pl],'s children in much of the laboratory equipment's use. Maria's paternal grandfather, J\u00f3zef Sk\u0142odowski\u00a0[pl], was eventually fired by Maria's paternal grandfather, J\u00f3zef Sk\u0142odowski\u00a0[pl],'s Russian supervisors for pro-Polish sentiments and forced to take lower-paying posts; the family also lost money on a bad investment and eventually chose to supplement the family's income by lodging boys in the house. [0]'s operated a prestigious Warsaw, in Congress Poland in the Russian Empire, boarding school for girls; Bronis\u0142awa resigned from the position after [0] was born. Bronis\u0142awa died of tuberculosis in May 1878, when [0] was ten years old. Less than three years earlier, Zofia (born 1862, nicknamed Zosia) had died of typhus contracted from a boarder. Maria's father was an atheist, [0]'s a devout Catholic. The deaths of [0]'s and sister caused [0] to give up Catholicism and become agnostic.When [0] was ten years old, [0] began attending the boarding school of J. Sikorska; next, [0] attended a gymnasium for girls, from which [0] graduated on 12 June 1883 with a gold medal. After a collapse, possibly due to depression, [0] spent the following year in the countryside with relatives of Maria's father, and the next year with Maria's father in Warsaw, in Congress Poland in the Russian Empire. Unable to enroll in a regular institution of higher education because [0] was a woman, she and her sister Bronis\u0142awa became involved with the clandestine Flying University (sometimes translated as Floating University), a Polish patriotic institution of higher learning that admitted women students.[0] made an agreement with [0]'s that [0] would give Bronis\u0142awa's financial assistance during Bronis\u0142awa's medical studies in Paris, in exchange for similar assistance two years later. In connection with give, [0] took a position first as a home tutor in Warsaw, in Congress Poland in the Russian Empire,, then for two years as a governess in Szczuki with a landed family, the \u017borawskis, who were relatives of her father. While working for a landed family, the \u017borawskis, who were relatives of her father, [0] fell in love with a landed family, the \u017borawskis, who were relatives of her father's . their son, Kazimierz \u017borawski, a future eminent mathematician's rejected the idea of their son, Kazimierz \u017borawski, a future eminent mathematician's marrying [0], and their son, Kazimierz \u017borawski, a future eminent mathematician was unable to oppose His parents. [0]'s loss of the relationship with their son, Kazimierz \u017borawski, a future eminent mathematician was tragic for she and her sister Bronis\u0142awa. their son, Kazimierz \u017borawski, a future eminent mathematician soon earned a doctorate and pursued an academic career as a mathematician, becoming a professor and rector of Krak\u00f3w University. Still, as an old man and a mathematics professor at the Warsaw Polytechnic, their son, Kazimierz \u017borawski, a future eminent mathematician would sit contemplatively before the statue of [0] that had been erected in 1935 before the Radium Institute, which [0] had founded in 1932.At the beginning of 1890, Bronis\u0142awainvited [0] to join them in Paris. [0] declined because [0] could not afford the university tuition; it would take [0] a year and a half longer to gather the necessary funds. [0] was helped by Maria's father. All that time [0] continued to educate [0], reading books, exchanging letters, and being tutored [0]. In early 1889 [0] returned home to Maria's father in Warsaw, in Congress Poland in the Russian Empire,. [0] continued working as a governess and remained there until late 1891. [0] tutored, studied at the Flying University, and began [0]'s practical scientific training (1890\u201391) in a chemistry laboratory at the Museum of Industry and Agriculture at Krakowskie Przedmie\u015bcie 66, near Warsaw's Old Town. a chemistry laboratory at the Museum of Industry and Agriculture at Krakowskie Przedmie\u015bcie 66, near Warsaw's Old Town was run by [0]'s cousin J\u00f3zef Boguski, who had been an assistant in Saint Petersburg to the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleyev.", "Life in Paris": "[0]\u00a0 is our person to focus on. In late 1891, [0] left Poland for France. In Paris, [0] [0] briefly found shelter with [0]'s sister and brother-in-law before renting a garret closer to the university, in the Latin Quarter, and proceeding with her studies of physics, chemistry, and mathematics at the universitylate 1891. [0] subsisted on [0]'s meagre resources, keeping [0] warm during cold winters by wearing all the clothes [0] had. [0] focused so hard on her studies of physics, chemistry, and mathematics that [0] sometimes forgot to eat. [0] studied during the day and tutored evenings, barely earning [0]'s keep. In 1893, [0] was awarded a degree in physics and began work in an industrial laboratory of Gabriel Lippmann. Meanwhile, [0] continued studying at the university and with the aid of a fellowship [0] was able to earn a second degree in [0] had begun [0]'s scientific career in Paris with an investigation of the magnetic properties of various steels, commissioned by the Society for the Encouragement of National Industry. That same year, [0] entered [0]'s life: it was their's mutual interest in natural sciences that drew their together. [0] was an instructor at The City of Paris Industrial Physics and Chemistry Higher Educational Institution (ESPCI Paris). their were introduced by Polish physicist J\u00f3zef Wierusz-Kowalski, who had learned that [0] was looking for a larger laboratory space, something that Wierusz-Kowalski thought [0] could access. Though [0] did not have a large laboratory, [0] was able to find some space for [0] where [0] was able to begin work.their's mutual passion for science brought their increasingly closer, and their began to develop feelings for one another. Eventually, [0] proposed marriage, but at first [0] did not accept as [0] was still planning to go back to [0]'s . [0], however, declared that [0] was ready to move with [0] to Poland, even if move meant being reduced to teaching French. Meanwhile, for the 1894 summer break, [0] returned to Warsaw, where [0] visited [0]'s family. [0] was still labouring under the illusion that [0] would be able to work in [0]'s chosen field in Poland, but [0] was denied a place at Krak\u00f3w University because of sexism in academia. A letter from [0] convinced [0] to return to Paris to pursue a PhD. At [0]'s insistence, [0] had written up [0]'s research on magnetism and received [0]'s own doctorate in March 1895; [0] was also promoted to professor at The City of Paris Industrial Physics and Chemistry Higher Educational Institution (ESPCI Paris). A contemporary quip would call [0] \"[0]'s biggest discovery\".On 26 July 1895, their were married in Sceaux; neither wanted a religious service. [0]'s dark blue outfit, worn instead of a bridal gown, would serve [0] for many years as a laboratory outfit. their shared two pastimes: long bicycle trips and journeys abroad, which brought their even closer. In [0], [0] had found a new love, a partner, and a scientific collaborator on whom [0] could depend.", "New elements": "Marie Curie\u00a0 is our person to focus on. In 1895, Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen discovered the existence of [0], though the mechanism behind [0]'s production was not yet understood. In 1896, Henri Becquerel discovered that uranium salts emitted rays that resembled X-rays in their penetrating powerrays that resembled X-rays in their penetrating power's . Henri Becquerel demonstrated that rays that resembled X-rays in their penetrating power, unlike phosphorescence, did not depend on an external source of energy but seemed to arise spontaneously from uranium itselfuranium itself. Influenced by these two important discoveries, Marie Curie decided to look into uranium rays as a possible field of research for a thesis.Marie Curie used an innovative technique to investigate samples. Fifteen years earlier, her husband and her husband's brother had developed a version of the electrometer, a sensitive device for measuring electric charge. Using her husband's electrometer, Marie Curie discovered that uranium rays caused the air around a sample to conduct electricity. Using an innovative technique, Marie Curie's first result was the finding that the activity of the uranium compounds depended only on the quantity of uranium present. Marie Curie hypothesized that rays that resembled X-rays in their penetrating power was not the outcome of some interaction of molecules but must come from the atom itselfthe atom itself. hypothesized was an important step in disproving the assumption that atoms were indivisible.In 1897, Marie Curie's daughter Ir\u00e8ne was born. To support Marie Curie's family, Marie Curie began teaching at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure. The Curies did not have a dedicated laboratory; most of The Curies's research was carried out in a converted shed next to ESPCI. a converted shed next to ESPCI was poorly ventilated and not even waterproof. The Curies were unaware of the deleterious effects of radiation exposure attendant on The Curies's continued unprotected work with radioactive substances. the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure did not sponsor Marie Curie's research, but Marie Curie would receive subsidies from metallurgical and mining companies and from various organizations and governments.Marie Curie's systematic studies included two uranium minerals, pitchblende and torbernite (also known as chalcolite). her husband's electrometer showed that pitchblende was four times as active as uranium itself, and torbernite (also known as chalcolite) twice as active. Marie Curie concluded that, if Marie Curie's earlier results relating the quantity of uranium to uranium's activity were correct, then two uranium minerals, pitchblende and torbernite (also known as chalcolite) must contain small quantities of another substance that was far more active than uranium. Marie Curie began a systematic search for additional substances that emit radiation, and by 1898 Marie Curie discovered that the element thorium was also radioactive. Pierre Curie was increasingly intrigued by her work. By mid-1898 her husband was so invested in her work that her husband decided to drop her husband's work on crystals and to join Marie Curie.The [research] idea [writes Reid] was Marie Curie's own; no one helped Marie Curie formulate The [research] idea, and although Marie Curie took The [research] idea to her husband for her husband's opinion Marie Curie clearly established Marie Curie's ownership of The [research] idea. Marie Curie later recorded established twice in Marie Curie's biography of her husband to ensure there was no chance whatever of any ambiguity. It [is] likely that already at this early stage of Marie Curie's career [Marie Curie] realized that... many scientists would find it difficult to believe that a woman could be capable of the original work in which Marie Curie was involved. Marie Curie was acutely aware of the importance of promptly publishing Marie Curie's discoveries and thus establishing Marie Curie's priority. Had not Henri Becquerel, two years earlier, presented his discovery to the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure the day after Henri Becquerel made his discovery, credit for the discovery of radioactivity (and even a Nobel Prize), would instead have gone to Silvanus Thompson. Marie Curie chose the same rapid means of publication. Her paper, giving a brief and simple account of her work, was presented for Marie Curie to the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure on 12 April 1898 by her former professor, Gabriel Lippmann. Even so, just as Silvanus Thompson had been beaten by Henri Becquerel, so Marie Curie was beaten in the race to tell of her discovery that thorium gives off rays in the same way as uranium; two months earlier, Gerhard Carl Schmidt had published Gerhard Carl Schmidt's own finding in Berlin.At that time, no one else in the world of physics had noticed what Marie Curie recorded in a sentence of Her paper, giving a brief and simple account of her work, describing how much greater were the activities of two uranium minerals, pitchblende and torbernite (also known as chalcolite) than uranium itselfuranium itself: \"The fact is very remarkable, and leads to the belief that these minerals may contain an element which is much more active than uranium.\" Marie Curie later would recall how Marie Curie felt \"a passionate desire to verify the belief that these minerals may contain an element which is much more active than uranium as rapidly as possible.\" On 14 April 1898, The Curies optimistically weighed out a 100-gram sample of pitchblende and ground a 100-gram sample of pitchblende with a pestle and mortar. The Curies did not realize at the time that what The Curies were searching for was present in such minute quantities that The Curies would eventually have to process tonnes of pitchblende.In July 1898, Marie Curie and her husband published a joint paper announcing the existence of an element The Curies named \"polonium\", in honour of her native Poland, which would for another twenty years remain partitioned among three empires (Russian, Austrian, and Prussian). On 26 December 1898, The Curies announced the existence of another substance that was far more active than uranium. In the course of The Curies's research, The Curies also coined the word \"radioactivity\".To prove The Curies's discoveries beyond any doubt, The Curies sought to isolate polonium and radium in pure form. Pitchblende is a complex mineral; the chemical separation of Pitchblende's constituents was an arduous task. The discovery of polonium had been relatively easy; chemically polonium resembles the element bismuth, and polonium was the only bismuth-like substance in pitchblende. radium, however, was more elusive; radium is closely related chemically to barium, and Pitchblende contains both elements. By 1898 The Curies had obtained traces of radium, but appreciable quantities, uncontaminated with barium, were still beyond reach. The Curies undertook the arduous task of separating out radium salt by differential crystallization. From a tonne of Pitchblende, one-tenth of a gram of radium chloride was separated in 1902. In 1910, Marie Curie isolated pure radium metal. Marie Curie never succeeded in isolating polonium.Between 1898 and 1902, The Curies published, jointly or separately, a total of 32 scientific papers, including one that announced that, when exposed to radium, diseased, tumour-forming cells were destroyed faster than healthy cells.In 1900, Marie Curie became the first woman faculty member at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure and her husband joined the faculty of the University of Paris. In 1902 Marie Curie visited her native Poland, which would for another twenty years remain partitioned among three empires (Russian, Austrian, and Prussian) on the occasion of Marie Curie's father's death.In June 1903, supervised by her former professor, Gabriel Lippmann, Marie Curie was awarded Marie Curie's doctorate from the University of Paris. June 1903 The Curies were invited to the Royal Institution in London to give a speech on radioactivity; being a woman, Marie Curie was prevented from speaking, and Marie Curie was allowed to. Meanwhile, a new industry began developing, based on radium. The Curies did not patent her discovery that thorium gives off rays in the same way as uranium and benefited little from a new industry.", "Nobel Prizes": "[0]\u00a0 is our person to focus on. In December 1903 the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded Pierre Curie, Marie Curie, and Henri Becquerel the Nobel Prize in Physics, \"in recognition of the extraordinary services Pierre Curie, Marie Curie, and Henri Becquerel have rendered by Pierre Curie, Marie Curie, and Henri Becquerel's joint researches on the radiation phenomena discovered by Henri Becquerel.\" At first the committee had intended to honour Pierre Curie, Marie Curie, and Henri Becquerel, but a committee member and advocate for women scientists, Swedish mathematician Magnus G\u00f6sta Mittag-Leffler, alerted Pierre Curie to the situation, and after Pierre Curie's complaint, [0]'s name was added to the nomination. [0] was the first woman to be awarded a Nobel Prize.Curie and her husband declined to go to Stockholm to receive the Nobel Prize in Physics in person; Curie and her husband were too busy with Curie and her husband's work, and Pierre Curie, was feeling increasingly ill. As Nobel laureates were required to deliver a lecture, Curie and her husband finally undertook the trip in 1905. The award money allowed Curie and her husband to hire Curie and her husband's first laboratory assistant. Following the award of the Nobel Prize in Physics, and galvanized by an offer from the University of Geneva, which offered Pierre Curie a position, the University of Paris gave Pierre Curie a professorship and the chair of physics, although Curie and her husband still did not have a proper laboratory. Upon Pierre Curie's complaint, the University of Paris relented and agreed to furnish a new laboratory, but a new laboratory would not be ready until 1906.In December 1904, [0] gave birth to their second daughter, \u00c8ve. [0] hired Polish governesses to teach their second daughter, \u00c8ve [0]'s native language, and sent or took their second daughter, \u00c8ve on visits to Poland.On 19 April 1906, Pierre Curie was killed in a road accident. Walking across the Rue Dauphine in heavy rain, Pierre Curie was struck by a horse-drawn vehicle and fell under a horse-drawn vehicle's wheels, fracturing Pierre Curie's skull and killing Pierre Curie instantly. [0] was devastated by Pierre Curie's . On 13 May 1906 the physics department of the University of Paris decided to retain the chair of physics and offer the chair of physics to [0]. [0] accepted the chair of physics, hoping to create a world-class laboratory as a tribute to Pierre Curie. [0] was the first woman to become a professor at the University of Paris.[0]'s quest to create a new laboratory did not end with the University of Paris, however. In [0]'s later years, [0] headed the Radium Institute (Institut du radium, now Curie Institute, Institut Curie), a radioactivity laboratory created for [0] by the Pasteur Institute and the University of Paris. The initiative for creating the Radium Institute (Institut du radium, now Curie Institute, Institut Curie) had come in 1909 from Pierre Paul \u00c9mile Roux, director of the Pasteur Institute, who had been disappointed that the University of Paris was not giving [0] a proper laboratory and had suggested that [0] move to the Pasteur Institute. Only then, with the threat of [0] leaving, did the University of Paris relent, and eventually the Curie Pavilion became a joint initiative of the University of Paris and the Pasteur Institute.In 1910 [0] succeeded in isolating radium; [0] also defined an international standard for radioactive emissions that was eventually named for Curie and her husband: the curie. Nevertheless, in 1911 the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences failed, by one or two votes, to elect [0] to membership in the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Elected instead was \u00c9douard Branly, an inventor who had helped Guglielmo Marconi develop the wireless telegraph. It was only over half a century later, in 1962, that a doctoral student of [0]'s, Marguerite Perey, became the first woman elected to membership in the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.Despite [0]'s fame as a scientist working for France, the public's attitude tended toward xenophobia\u2014the same that had led to the Dreyfus affair\u2014which also fuelled false speculation that [0] was Jewish. During the the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences elections, [0] was vilified by the right-wing press as a foreigner and atheist. [0]'s daughter later remarked on the right-wing press's hypocrisy in portraying [0] as an unworthy foreigner when [0] was nominated for a French honour, but portraying [0] as a French heroine when [0] received foreign honours such as [0]'s Nobel Prizes.In 1911 it was revealed that [0] was involved in a year-long affair with physicist Paul Langevin, a former student of Pierre Curie's, a married man who was estranged from his wife. a year-long affair with physicist Paul Langevin, a former student of Pierre Curie's, a married man who was estranged from his wife resulted in a press scandal that was exploited by [0]'s academic opponents. [0] [0]'s was five years older than Pierre Curie and was misrepresented in the tabloids as a foreign Jewish home-wrecker. When a year-long affair with physicist Paul Langevin, a former student of Pierre Curie's, a married man who was estranged from his wife broke, [0] was away at a conference in Belgium; on [0]'s return, [0] found an angry mob in front of [0]'s house and had to seek refuge, with their second daughter, \u00c8ve, in the home of [0]'s friend, Camille Marbo.International recognition for [0]'s work had been growing to new heights, and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, overcoming opposition prompted by a year-long affair with physicist Paul Langevin, a former student of Pierre Curie's, a married man who was estranged from his wife, honoured [0] a second time, with the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was \"in recognition of [0]'s services to the advancement of chemistry by the discovery of the elements radium and polonium, by the isolation of radium and the study of the nature and compounds of radium.\" Because of the negative publicity due to a year-long affair with physicist Paul Langevin, a former student of Pierre Curie's, a married man who was estranged from his wife, the chair of the committee, Svante Arrhenius, attempted to prevent [0]'s attendance at the official ceremony for her Nobel Prize in Chemistry, citing [0]'s questionable moral standing. [0] replied that [0] would be present at the official ceremony for her Nobel Prize in Chemistry, because \"the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry has been given to [0] for the discovery of the elements radium and polonium\" and that \"there is no relation between [0]'s scientific work and the facts of [0]'s private life\".[0] was the first person to win or share two Nobel Prizes, and remains alone with Linus Pauling as Nobel laureates in two fields each. A delegation of celebrated Polish men of learning, headed by novelist Henryk Sienkiewicz, encouraged [0] to return to Poland and continue [0]'s research in [0]'s . the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry enabled [0] to persuade the French government to support the Radium Institute (Institut du radium, now Curie Institute, Institut Curie). A month after accepting the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, [0] was hospitalised with depression and a kidney ailment. For most of 1912, [0] avoided public life but did spend time in England with [0]'s friend and fellow physicist, Hertha Ayrton. [0] returned to [0]'s laboratory only in December, after a break of about 14 months.In 1912 the Warsaw Scientific Society offered [0] the directorship of a new laboratory in Warsaw but [0] declined, focusing on the developing Radium Institute to be completed in August 1914, and on a new street named Rue Pierre-Curie (today rue Pierre-et-Marie-Curie). [0] was appointed director of the Curie Laboratory in the Radium Institute (Institut du radium, now Curie Institute, Institut Curie). [0] visited Poland in 1913 and was welcomed in Warsaw but visited was mostly ignored by the Russian authorities. the Radium Institute (Institut du radium, now Curie Institute, Institut Curie)'s development was interrupted by the coming war, as most researchers were drafted into the French Army, and the Radium Institute (Institut du radium, now Curie Institute, Institut Curie) fully resumed the Radium Institute (Institut du radium, now Curie Institute, Institut Curie)'s activities in 1919.", "World War I": "[0]\u00a0 is our person to focus on. During World War I, [0] recognised that wounded soldiers were best served if operated upon as soon as possible. [0] saw a need for field radiological centres near the front lines to assist battlefield surgeons, including to obviate amputations when in fact limbs could be saved. After a quick study of radiology, anatomy, and automotive mechanics, [0] procured X-ray equipment, vehicles, and auxiliary generators, and [0] developed mobile radiography units, which came to be popularly known as petites Curies (\"Little Curies\"). [0] became the director of the Red Cross Radiology Service and set up France's's first military radiology centre, operational by late 1914. Assisted at first by a military doctor and [0]'s 17-year-old daughter Ir\u00e8ne, [0] directed the installation of 20 mobile radiological vehicles and another 200 radiological units at field hospitals in the first year of World War I. Later, [0] began training other women as aides.In 1915, [0] produced hollow needles containing \"radium emanation\", a colourless, radioactive gas given off by radium, later identified as radon, to be used for sterilizing infected tissue. [0] provided the radium from [0]'s own one-gram supply. It is estimated that over a million wounded soldiers were treated with mobile radiography units, which came to be popularly known as petites Curies (\"Little Curies\"). Busy with this work, [0] carried out very little scientific research during that period. In spite of all her humanitarian contributions to the French war effort, [0] never received any formal recognition of all her humanitarian contributions to the French war effort from the French government.Also, promptly after World War I started, [0] attempted to donate her gold Nobel Prize medals to the French war effort but the French National Bank refused to accept her gold Nobel Prize medals.  [0] did buy war bonds, using her Nobel Prize money. [0] said:[0] am going to give up her Nobel Prize money. [0] shall add to her Nobel Prize money the scientific medals, which are quite useless to [0]. There is something else: by sheer laziness [0] had allowed the money for my second Nobel Prize to remain in Stockholm in Swedish crowns. the money for my second Nobel Prize is the chief part of what we possess. [0] should like to bring the money for my second Nobel Prize back here and invest the money for my second Nobel Prize in war loans. France's needs the money for my second Nobel Prize. Only, [0] have no illusions: the money for my second Nobel Prize will probably be lost.  [0] was also an active member in committees of Polonia in France's dedicated to the Polish cause. After World War I, [0] summarized [0]'s wartime experiences in a book, Radiology in War (1919).", "Postwar years": "[0]\u00a0 is our person to focus on. In 1920, for the 25th anniversary of the discovery of radium, the French government established a stipend for her; a stipend for her's previous recipient was Louis Pasteur (1822\u201395). In 1921, [0] was welcomed triumphantly when [0] toured the United States to raise funds for research on radium. Mrs. William Brown Meloney, after interviewing [0], created a [0] Radium Fund and raised money to buy radium, publicising [0]'s .In 1921, U.S. President Warren G. Harding received [0] at the White House to present [0] with the 1\u00a0gram of radium collected in the United States, and U.S. President Warren G. Harding praised [0] as an example of a professional achiever who was also a supportive wife. Before received, recognising [0]'s growing fame abroad, and embarrassed by the fact that [0] had no French official distinctions to wear in public, the French government offered [0] a Legion of Honour award, but [0] refused. In 1922 [0] became a fellow of the French Academy of Medicine. [0] also travelled to other countries, appearing publicly and giving lectures in Belgium, Brazil, Spain, and Czechoslovakia.Led by [0], the Institute produced four more Nobel Prize winners, including [0]'s daughter Ir\u00e8ne Joliot-Curie and [0]'s son-in-law, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Joliot-Curie. Eventually the Institute became one of the world's four major radioactivity-research laboratories, the others being the Cavendish Laboratory, with Ernest Rutherford; the Institute for Radium Research, Vienna, with Stefan Meyer; and the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry, with Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner.In August 1922 [0] became a member of the League of Nations' newly created International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation. [0] sat on the League of Nations' newly created International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation until 1934 and contributed to the League of Nations''s scientific coordination with other prominent researchers such as Albert Einstein, Hendrik Lorentz, and Henri Bergson. In 1923 [0] wrote a biography of [0]'s late husband, titled Pierre Curie. In 1925 [0] visited Poland to participate in a ceremony laying the foundations for Warsaw's Radium Institute. [0]'s second American tour, in 1929, succeeded in equipping Warsaw's Radium Institute with radium; Warsaw's Radium Institute opened in 1932, with [0]'s sister Bronis\u0142awa Warsaw's Radium Institute's director. These distractions from [0]'s scientific labours, and the attendant publicity, caused [0] much discomfort but provided resources for [0]'s work. In 1930 [0] was elected to the International Atomic Weights Committee, on which [0] served until [0]'s death. In 1931, [0] was awarded the Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh.", "Death": "[0]\u00a0 is our person to focus on. [0] visited Poland for the last time in early 1934. A few months later, on 4 July 1934, [0] died aged 66 at the Sancellemoz sanatorium in Passy, Haute-Savoie, from aplastic anemia believed to have been contracted from [0]'s long-term exposure to radiation, causing damage to [0]'s bone marrow.The damaging effects of ionising radiation were not known at the time of [0]'s work, which had been carried out without the safety measures later developed. [0] had carried test tubes containing radioactive isotopes in [0]'s pocket, and [0] stored test tubes containing radioactive isotopes in [0]'s desk drawer, remarking on the faint light that the substances gave off in the dark. [0] was also exposed to X-rays from unshielded equipment while serving as a radiologist in field hospitals during the First World War.  When [0]'s body was exhumed in 1995, the French Office de Protection contre les Rayonnements Ionisants (ORPI) \"concluded that [0] could not have been exposed to lethal levels of radium while [0] was alive\". the French Office de Protection contre les Rayonnements Ionisants (ORPI) pointed out that radium poses a risk only if radium is ingested, and speculated that [0]'s illness was more likely to have been due to [0]'s use of radiography during the First World War.[0] was interred at the cemetery in Sceaux, alongside [0]'s husband Pierre. Sixty years later, in 1995, in honour of their's achievements, the remains of both were transferred to the Paris Panth\u00e9on. the remains of both were sealed in a lead lining because of the radioactivity. [0] became the second woman to be interred at the Paris Panth\u00e9on (after Sophie Berthelot) and the first woman to be honoured with interment in the Panth\u00e9on on her own meritsthe first woman to be honoured with interment in the Panth\u00e9on on her own merits's .Because of their levels of radioactive contamination, her papers from the 1890s are considered too dangerous to handle. Even [0]'s cookbooks are highly radioactive. her papers from the 1890s are kept in lead-lined boxes, and those who wish to consult her papers from the 1890s must wear protective clothing. In [0] last year, [0] worked on a book, Radioactivity, which was published posthumously in 1935.", "": ""}, "Legacy": {"": "Marie Curie\u00a0 is our person to focus on. The physical and societal aspects of the Curies' work contributed to shaping the world of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Cornell University professor L. Pearce Williams observes:The result of the Curies' work was epoch-making. Radium's radioactivity was so great that Radium's radioactivity could not be ignored. Radium's radioactivity seemed to contradict the principle of the conservation of energy and therefore forced a reconsideration of the foundations of physics. On the experimental level the discovery of radium provided men like Ernest Rutherford with sources of radioactivity with which men like Ernest Rutherford could probe the structure of the atom. As a result of Ernest Rutherford's experiments with alpha radiation, the nuclear atom was first postulated. In medicine, the radioactivity of radium appeared to offer a means by which cancer could be successfully attacked. If Curie's work helped overturn established ideas in physics and chemistry, Curie's work has had an equally profound effect in the societal sphere. To attain Marie Curie's scientific achievements, Marie Curie had to overcome barriers, in both Marie Curie's native and Marie Curie's adoptive country, that were placed in Marie Curie's way because Marie Curie was a woman. This aspect of Marie Curie's life and career is highlighted in Fran\u00e7oise Giroud's Marie Curie: A Life, which emphasizes Marie Curie's role as a feminist precursor.Marie Curie was known for Marie Curie's honesty and moderate lifestyle. Having received a small scholarship in 1893, Marie Curie returned a small scholarship in 1897 as soon as Marie Curie began earning Marie Curie's keep. Marie Curie gave much of Marie Curie's first Nobel Prize money to friends, family, students, and research associates. In an unusual decision, Marie Curie intentionally refrained from patenting the radium-isolation process so that the scientific community could do research unhindered.  Marie Curie insisted that monetary gifts and awards be given to the scientific institutions Marie Curie was affiliated with rather than to Marie Curie. Marie Curie and Marie Curie's husband often refused awards and medals. Albert Einstein reportedly remarked that Marie Curie was probably the only person who could not be corrupted by fame."}, "Commemoration and cultural depictions": {"": "[0]\u00a0 is our person to focus on.
