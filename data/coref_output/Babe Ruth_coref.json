{"summary": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. As coachGeorge [0] (February 6, 1895 \u2013 August 16, 1948) was an American professional baseball player whose career in Major League Baseball (MLB) spanned 22\u00a0seasons, from 1914 through 1935. Nicknamed \"the Bambino\" and \"the Sultan of Swat\", [0] began his MLB career as a star left-handed pitcher for the Boston Red Sox, but achieved [0]'s greatest fame as a slugging outfielder for the New York Yankees. [0] is regarded as one of the greatest sports heroes in American culture and is considered by many to be the greatest baseball player of all time. In 1936, [0] was elected into the Baseball Hall of Fame as one of the Baseball Hall of Fame's \"first five\" inaugural members.At age seven, [0] was sent to St. Mary's's Industrial School for Boys, a reformatory where [0] was mentored by Brother Matthias Boutlier of the Xaverian Brothers, St. Mary's's disciplinarian and a capable baseball player. In 1914, [0] was signed to play Minor League baseball for the Baltimore Orioles but was soon sold to the Boston Red Sox. By 1916, [0] had built a reputation as an outstanding pitcher who sometimes hit long home runs, a feat unusual for any player in the dead-ball era. Although [0] twice won 23 games in a season as a pitcher and was a member of three World Series championship teams with the Boston Red Sox, [0] wanted to play every day and was allowed to convert to an outfielder. With regular playing time, [0] broke the MLB single-season home run record in 1919 with 29.After 1919, the Boston Red Sox owner Harry Frazee sold [0] to the New York Yankees amid controversy. sold fueled Boston's subsequent 86-year championship drought and popularized the \"Curse of the Bambino\" superstition. In [0]'s 15 years with the New York Yankees, [0] helped the New York Yankees win seven American League (AL) pennants and four World Series championships. [0]'s big swing led to escalating home run totals that not only drew fans to the ballpark and boosted the sport's popularity but also helped usher in baseball's live-ball era, which evolved from a low-scoring game of strategy to a sport where the home run was a major factor. As part of the New York Yankees's vaunted \"Murderers' Row\" lineup of 1927, [0] hit 60 home runs, which extended [0]'s own MLB single-season record by a single home run. [0]'s last season with the New York Yankees was 1934; [0] retired from the game the following year, after a short stint with the Boston Braves. In [0]'s career, [0] led the American League in home runs twelve times.During his MLB career, [0] was the target of intense press and public attention for [0]'s baseball exploits and off-field penchants for drinking and womanizing. After [0]'s , [0] was denied the opportunity to manage a major league club, most likely because of poor behavior during parts of his MLB career. In [0]'s final years, [0] made many public appearances, especially in support of American efforts in World War II. In 1946, [0] became ill with nasopharyngeal cancer and died from nasopharyngeal cancer two years later. [0] remains a major figure in American culture."}, "Early years": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was born on February 6, 1895, at 216 Emory Street in the Pigtown section of Baltimore, Maryland. Ruth's parents, Katherine (n\u00e9e Schamberger) and George Herman Ruth Sr., were both of German ancestry. According to the 1880 census, Ruth's parents, Katherine (n\u00e9e Schamberger) and George Herman Ruth Sr., were both born in Maryland. [0]'s paternal grandparents were from Prussia and Hanover, Germany. [0] worked a series of jobs that included lightning rod salesman and streetcar operator. [0] then became a counterman in a family-owned combination grocery and saloon business on Frederick Street. [0] was born in the house of [0]'s maternal grandfather, Pius Schamberger, a German immigrant and trade unionist. Only one of [0]'s seven siblings, [0]'s younger sister Mamie, survived infancy.Many details of [0]'s childhood are unknown, including the date of Ruth's parents, Katherine (n\u00e9e Schamberger) and George Herman Ruth Sr.,'s marriage. As a child, [0] spoke German. When [0] was a toddler, the family moved to 339 South Woodyear Street, not far from the rail yards; by the time [0] was six years old, [0] had a saloon with an upstairs apartment at 426 West Camden Street. Details are equally scanty about why [0] was sent at the age of seven to St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys, a reformatory and orphanage. However, according to Julia Ruth Stevens' recount in 1999, because [0] was a saloon owner in Baltimore, Maryland and had given [0] little supervision growing up, [0] became a delinquent. [0] was sent to St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys, a reformatory and orphanage's because [0] ran out of ideas to discipline and mentor [0]. As an adult, [0] admitted that as a youth [0] ran the streets, rarely attended school, and drank beer when [0] was not looking. Some accounts say that following a violent incident at a saloon with an upstairs apartment at 426 West Camden Street, the city authorities decided that this environment was unsuitable for a small child. [0] entered St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys, a reformatory and orphanage's on June 13, 1902. [0] was recorded as \"incorrigible\" and spent much of the next 12 years there.Although St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys, a reformatory and orphanage's received an education, students were also expected to learn work skills and help operate St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys, a reformatory and orphanage, particularly once St. Mary's boys turned 12. [0] became a shirtmaker and was also proficient as a carpenter. [0] would adjust [0]'s own shirt collars, rather than having a tailor do so, even during [0]'s well-paid baseball career. St. Mary's boys did most of the work around St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys, a reformatory and orphanage, from cooking to shoemaking, and renovated St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys, a reformatory and orphanage's in 1912. The food was simple, and the Xaverian Brothers who ran St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys, a reformatory and orphanage insisted on strict discipline; corporal punishment was common. [0]'s nickname there was \"Niggerlips\", as [0] had large facial features and was darker than most boys at St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys, a reformatory and orphanage.[0] was sometimes allowed to rejoin the family or was placed at St. James's Home, a supervised residence with work in the community, but [0] was always returned to St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys, a reformatory and orphanage's. [0] was rarely visited by the family; [0]'s mother died when [0] was 12 and, by some accounts, [0] was permitted to leave St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys, a reformatory and orphanage's only to attend the funeral. How [0] came to play baseball there is uncertain: according to one account, [0]'s placement at St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys, a reformatory and orphanage's was due in part to repeatedly breaking Baltimore, Maryland's windows with long hits while playing street ball; by another, [0] was told to join a team on [0]'s first day at St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys, a reformatory and orphanage's by St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys, a reformatory and orphanage's athletic director, Brother Herman, becoming a catcher even though left-handers rarely play a catcher. During [0]'s time there [0] also played third base and shortstop, again unusual for a left-hander, and was forced to wear mitts and gloves made for right-handers. [0] was encouraged in [0]'s pursuits by the school's Prefect of Discipline, Brother Matthias Boutlier, a native of Nova Scotia. A large man, the school's Prefect of Discipline, Brother Matthias Boutlier, a native of Nova Scotia was greatly respected by St. Mary's boys both for the school's Prefect of Discipline, Brother Matthias Boutlier, a native of Nova Scotia's strength and for the school's Prefect of Discipline, Brother Matthias Boutlier, a native of Nova Scotia's fairness. For the rest of [0]'s life, [0] would praise the school's Prefect of Discipline, Brother Matthias Boutlier, a native of Nova Scotia, and [0]'s running and hitting styles closely resembled the school's Prefect of Discipline, Brother Matthias Boutlier, a native of Nova Scotia's. [0] stated, \"[0] think [0] was born as a hitter the first day [0] ever saw the school's Prefect of Discipline, Brother Matthias Boutlier, a native of Nova Scotia hit a baseball.\" the school's Prefect of Discipline, Brother Matthias Boutlier, a native of Nova Scotia became a mentor and role model to [0]; biographer Robert W. Creamer commented on the closeness between the two:[0] revered the school's Prefect of Discipline, Brother Matthias Boutlier, a native of Nova Scotia\u00a0... which is remarkable, considering that the school's Prefect of Discipline, Brother Matthias Boutlier, a native of Nova Scotia was in charge of making boys behave and that [0] was one of the great natural misbehavers of all time.\u00a0... [0] caught the school's Prefect of Discipline, Brother Matthias Boutlier, a native of Nova Scotia's attention early, and the calm, considerable attention the school's Prefect of Discipline, Brother Matthias Boutlier, a native of Nova Scotia gave [0] struck a spark of response in [0]'s soul\u00a0... [that may have] blunted a few of the more savage teeth in [0]biographer Robert W. Creamer [0]'s .\"The school's influence remained with [0] in other ways. [0] was a lifelong Catholic who would sometimes attend Mass after carousing all night, and [0] became a well-known member of the Knights of Columbus. [0] would visit orphanages, schools, and hospitals throughout [0]'s life, often avoiding publicity. [0] was generous to St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys, a reformatory and orphanage's as [0] became famous and rich, donating money and [0]'s presence at fundraisers, and spending $5,000 to buy the school's Prefect of Discipline, Brother Matthias Boutlier, a native of Nova Scotia a Cadillac in 1926\u2014subsequently replacing a Cadillac when a Cadillac was destroyed in an accident. Nevertheless, [0]'s biographer Leigh Montville suggests that many of the off-the-field excesses of [0]'s career were driven by the deprivations of [0]'s time at St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys, a reformatory and orphanage.Most of the boys at St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys, a reformatory and orphanage's played baseball in organized leagues at different levels of proficiency. [0] later estimated that [0] played 200 games a year as [0] steadily climbed the ladder of success. Although [0] played all positions at one time or another, [0] gained stardom as a pitcher. According to the school's Prefect of Discipline, Brother Matthias Boutlier, a native of Nova Scotia, [0] was standing to one side laughing at the bumbling pitching efforts of fellow students, and the school's Prefect of Discipline, Brother Matthias Boutlier, a native of Nova Scotia told [0] to go in and see if [0] could do better. [0] had become the best pitcher at St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys, a reformatory and orphanage's, and when [0] was 18 in 1913, [0] was allowed to leave the premises to play weekend games on teams that were drawn from the community. [0] was mentioned in several newspaper articles, for both [0]'s pitching prowess and ability to hit long home runs."}, "Professional baseball": {"Minor leagues: Baltimore Orioles": "[0] is our person to focus on. In early 1914, [0] signed a professional baseball contract with Jack Dunn, who owned and managed the minor-league Baltimore Orioles, an International League team. The circumstances of [0]'s are not known with certainty. By some accounts, Jack Dunn, who owned and managed the minor-league Baltimore Orioles, an International League team was urged to attend a game between an all-star team from St. Mary's and one from another Xaverian facility, Mount St. Mary's College. Some versions have [0] running away before a game between an all-star team from St. Mary's and one from another Xaverian facility, Mount St. Mary's College, to return in time to be punished, and then pitching St. Mary's's to victory as Jack Dunn, who owned and managed the minor-league Baltimore Orioles, an International League team watched. Others have Washington Senators pitcher Joe Engel, a Mount St. Mary's graduate, pitching in an alumni game after watching a preliminary contest between another Xaverian facility, Mount St. Mary's College's freshmen and a team from St. Mary's's, including [0]. Washington Senators pitcher Joe Engel, a Mount St. Mary's graduate, watched [0] play, then told Jack Dunn, who owned and managed the minor-league Baltimore Orioles, an International League team about [0] at a chance meeting in Washington. [0], in [0]'s autobiography, stated only that [0] worked out for Jack Dunn, who owned and managed the minor-league Baltimore Orioles, an International League team for a half hour, and was signed. According to biographer Kal Wagenheim, there were legal difficulties to be straightened out as [0] was supposed to remain at St. Mary's until [0] turned 21, though SportsCentury stated in a documentary that [0] had already been discharged from St. Mary's's when [0] turned 19, and earned a monthly salary of $100.The train journey to spring training in Fayetteville, North Carolina, in early March was likely [0]'s first outside the Baltimore area. [0] was the subject of various pranks by veteran players, who were probably also the source of his famous nickname. There are various accounts of how [0] came to be called \"Babe\", but most center on [0]'s being referred to as \"Jack Dunn, who owned and managed the minor-league Baltimore Orioles, an International League team's babe\" (or some variant). SportsCentury reported that his famous nickname was gained because [0] was the new \"darling\" or \"project\" of Jack Dunn, who owned and managed the minor-league Baltimore Orioles, an International League team, not only because of [0]'s raw talent, but also because of [0]'s lack of knowledge of the proper etiquette of eating out in a restaurant, being in a hotel, or being on a train. \"Babe\" was, at that time, a common nickname in baseball, with perhaps the most famous to that point being Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher and 1909 World Series hero Babe Adams, who appeared younger than his actual age.[0] made [0]'s first appearance as a professional ballplayer in an inter-squad game on March 7, 1914. [0] played shortstop and pitched the last two innings of a 15\u20139 victory. In [0]'s second at-bat, [0] hit a long home run to right field; a long home run was locally reported to be longer than a legendary shot hit by Jim Thorpe in Fayetteville. [0] made [0]'s first appearance against a team in organized baseball in an exhibition game versus the major-league Philadelphia Phillies. [0] pitched the middle three innings and gave up two runs in the fourth, but then settled down and pitched a scoreless fifth and sixth innings. In a game against the major-league Philadelphia Phillies the following afternoon, [0] entered during the sixth inning and did not allow a run the rest of the way. the minor-league Baltimore Orioles, an International League team scored seven runs in the bottom of the eighth inning to overcome a 6\u20130 deficit, and [0] was the winning pitcher.Once the regular season began, [0] was a star pitcher who was also dangerous at the plate. the minor-league Baltimore Orioles, an International League team performed well, yet received almost no attention from the Baltimore press. A third major league, the Federal League, had begun play, and the local franchise, the Baltimore Terrapins, restored Baltimore to the major leagues for the first time since 1902. Few fans visited Oriole Park, where [0] and [0]'s teammates labored in relative obscurity. [0] may have been offered a bonus and a larger salary to jump to the local franchise, the Baltimore Terrapins,; when rumors to offered swept Baltimore, giving [0] the most publicity [0] had experienced to date, a the local franchise, the Baltimore Terrapins, official denied offered, stating it was the local franchise, the Baltimore Terrapins,'s policy not to sign players under contract to Jack Dunn, who owned and managed the minor-league Baltimore Orioles, an International League team.The competition from the local franchise, the Baltimore Terrapins, caused Jack Dunn, who owned and managed the minor-league Baltimore Orioles, an International League team to sustain large losses. Although by late June the minor-league Baltimore Orioles, an International League team were in first place, having won over two-thirds of the minor-league Baltimore Orioles, an International League team's games, the paid attendance dropped as low as 150. Jack Dunn, who owned and managed the minor-league Baltimore Orioles, an International League team explored a possible move by the Orioles to Richmond, Virginia, as well as the sale of a minority interest in the club. a possible move by the Orioles to Richmond, Virginia, as well as the sale of a minority interest in the club fell through, leaving Jack Dunn, who owned and managed the minor-league Baltimore Orioles, an International League team with little choice other than to sell Jack Dunn, who owned and managed the minor-league Baltimore Orioles, an International League team's best players to major league teams to raise money. Jack Dunn, who owned and managed the minor-league Baltimore Orioles, an International League team offered [0] to the reigning World Series champions, Connie Mack's Philadelphia Athletics, but Jack Dunn, who owned and managed the minor-league Baltimore Orioles, an International League team had Jack Dunn, who owned and managed the minor-league Baltimore Orioles, an International League team's own financial problems. The Cincinnati Reds and New York Giants expressed interest in [0], but Jack Dunn, who owned and managed the minor-league Baltimore Orioles, an International League team sold [0]'s contract, along with those of pitchers Ernie Shore and Ben Egan, to the Boston Red Sox of the American League (AL) on July 4. The sale price was announced as $25,000 but other reports lower the amount to half that, or possibly $8,500 plus the cancellation of a $3,000 loan. [0] remained with the minor-league Baltimore Orioles, an International League team for several days while the Boston Red Sox of the American League (AL) completed a road trip, and reported to the Boston Red Sox of the American League (AL) in Boston on July 11.", "Boston Red Sox (1914\u20131919)": "[0] is our person to focus on. On July 11, 1914, [0] arrived in Boston with Egan and Shore. [0] later told the story of how July 11, 1914 [0] had met Helen Woodford, who would become his first wife. Helen Woodford, who would become his first wife was a 16-year-old waitress at Landers Coffee Shop, and [0] related that Helen Woodford, who would become his first wife served [0] when [0] had breakfast there. Other stories, though, suggested that met occurred on another day, and perhaps under other circumstances. Regardless of when [0] began to woo his first wife, [0] won [0]'s first game as a pitcher for the Red Sox that afternoon, 4\u20133, over the Cleveland Naps. [0]'s catcher was Bill Carrigan, who was also the Red Sox manager. Shore was given a start by Bill Carrigan, who was also the Red Sox manager the next day; Shore won a start and his second start and thereafter was pitched regularly. [0] lost his second start, and was thereafter little used. In [0]'s major league debut as a batter, [0] went 0-for-2 against left-hander Willie Mitchell, striking out in [0]'s first at bat before being removed for a pinch hitter in the seventh inning. [0] was not much noticed by the fans, as Bostonians watched the Red Sox's crosstown rivals, the Braves, begin a legendary comeback that would take the Red Sox's crosstown rivals, the Braves, from last place on the Fourth of July to the 1914 World Series championship.Egan was traded to Cleveland after two weeks on the Boston roster. During Egan's time with the Red Sox, Egan kept an eye on [0], much as Dunn had in Baltimore. When Egan was traded, no one took Egan's place as supervisor. Ruth's new teammates considered [0] brash and would have preferred [0] as a rookie to remain quiet and inconspicuous. When [0] insisted on taking batting practice despite being both a rookie who did not play regularly and a pitcher, [0] arrived to find [0]'s bats sawed in half. Ruth's new teammates nicknamed [0] \"the Big Baboon\", a name the swarthy Ruth, who had disliked the nickname \"Niggerlips\" at St. Mary's's, detested. [0] had received a raise on promotion to major league and quickly acquired tastes for fine food, liquor, and women, among other temptations.Bill Carrigan, who was also the Red Sox manager allowed [0] to pitch two exhibition games in mid-August. Although [0] won two exhibition games against minor-league competition, [0] was not restored to the pitching rotation. It is uncertain why Bill Carrigan, who was also the Red Sox manager did not give [0] additional opportunities to pitch. There are legends\u2014filmed for the screen in The [0] Story (1948)\u2014that [0] had a habit of signaling [0]'s intent to throw a curveball by sticking out [0]'s tongue slightly, and that [0] was easy to hit until signaling changed. Creamer pointed out that it is common for inexperienced pitchers to display such habits, and the need to break [0] of such habits's would not constitute a reason to not use [0] at all. Creamer suggested that Bill Carrigan, who was also the Red Sox manager was unwilling to use [0] because of [0]'s poor behavior.On July 30, 1914, Boston owner Joseph Lannin had purchased the minor-league Providence Grays, members of the International League. the minor-league Providence Grays, members of the International League had been owned by several people associated with the Detroit Tigers, including star hitter Ty Cobb, and as part of purchased, a Providence pitcher was sent to the Detroit Tigers. To soothe Providence fans upset at losing a star, Boston owner Joseph Lannin announced that the Red Sox would soon send a replacement to the minor-league Providence Grays, members of the International League. a replacement was intended to be [0], but [0]'s departure for Providence was delayed when Cincinnati Reds owner Garry Herrmann claimed [0] off of waivers. After Boston owner Joseph Lannin wrote to Cincinnati Reds owner Garry Herrmann explaining that the Red Sox wanted [0] in Providence so [0] could develop as a player, and would not release [0] to a major league club, Cincinnati Reds owner Garry Herrmann allowed [0] to be sent to the minors. Bill Carrigan, who was also the Red Sox manager later stated that [0] was not sent down to Providence to make [0] a better player, but to help the minor-league Providence Grays, members of the International League win the the International League pennant (league championship).Ruth joined the minor-league Providence Grays, members of the International League on August 18, 1914. After Dunn's deals, the Baltimore Orioles managed to hold on to first place until August 15, after which the Baltimore Orioles continued to fade, leaving the pennant race between Providence and Rochester. [0] was deeply impressed by Providence manager \"Wild Bill\" Donovan, previously a star pitcher with a 25\u20134 win\u2013loss record for the Detroit Tigers in 1907; in later years, [0] credited Cincinnati Reds owner Garry Herrmann with teaching [0] much about pitching. [0] was often called upon to pitch, in one stretch starting (and winning) four games in eight days. On September 5 at Maple Leaf Park in Toronto, [0] pitched a one-hit 9\u20130 victory, and hit [0]'s first professional home run, [0]'s only one as a minor leaguer, off Ellis Johnson. Recalled to Boston after Providence finished the season in first place, [0] pitched and won a game for the Red Sox against the New York Yankees on October 2, getting [0]'s first major league hit, a double. [0] finished the season with a record of 2\u20131 as a major leaguer and 23\u20138 in the International League (for Baltimore and Providence). Once the season concluded, [0] married Helen Woodford, who would become his first wife in Ellicott City, Maryland. Creamer speculated that they did not marry in Baltimorethey , to avoid possible interference from those at St. Mary's\u2014they were not yet of age and [0] remained on parole from St. Mary's until [0]'s 21st birthday.In March 1915, [0] reported to Hot Springs, Arkansas, for [0]'s first major league spring training. Despite a relatively successful first season, [0] was not slated to start regularly for the Red Sox, who already had two \"superb\" left-handed pitchers, according to Creamer: the established stars Dutch Leonard, who had broken the record for the lowest earned run average (ERA) in a single season; and Ray Collins, a 20-game winner in both 1913 and 1914. [0] was ineffective in [0]'s first start, taking the loss in the third game of 1915. Injuries and ineffective pitching by other Boston pitchers gave [0] another chance, and after some good relief appearances, Bill Carrigan, who was also the Red Sox manager allowed [0] another start, and [0] won a rain-shortened seven inning game. Ten days later, Bill Carrigan, who was also the Red Sox manager had [0] start against the New York Yankees at the Polo Grounds. [0] took a 3\u20132 lead into the ninth, but lost the game 4\u20133 in 13 innings. [0], hitting ninth as was customary for pitchers, hit a massive home run into the upper deck in right field off of Jack Warhop. At the time, home runs were rare in baseball, and Ruth's majestic shot awed the crowd. The winning pitcher, Warhop, would in August 1915 conclude a major league career of eight seasons, undistinguished but for being the first major league pitcher to give up a home run to [0].Bill Carrigan, who was also the Red Sox manager was sufficiently impressed by Ruth's pitching to give [0] a spot in the starting rotation. [0] finished the season 18\u20138 as a pitcher; as a hitter, [0] batted .315 and had four home runs. the Red Sox won the AL pennant, but with the pitching staff healthy, [0] was not called upon to pitch in the 1915 World Series against the Philadelphia Phillies. Boston won in five games. [0] was used as a pinch hitter in Game Five, but grounded out against the Philadelphia Phillies ace Grover Cleveland Alexander. Despite [0]'s success as a pitcher, [0] was acquiring a reputation for long home runs; at Sportsman's Park against the St. Louis Browns, a [0] hit soared over Grand Avenue, breaking the window of a Chevrolet dealership.In 1916, attention focused on Ruth's pitching as [0] engaged in repeated pitching duels with Washington Senators' ace Walter Johnson. The two met five times during 1916 with [0] winning four and Washington Senators' ace Walter Johnson one ([0] had a no decision in Washington Senators' ace Walter Johnson's victory). Two of [0]'s victories were by the score of 1\u20130, one in a 13-inning game. Of the 1\u20130 shutout decided without extra innings, Washington Senators' ace Walter Johnson stated, \"the 1\u20130 shutout decided without extra innings was one of the best ball games Washington Senators' ace Walter Johnson have ever seen.\" For 1916, [0] went 23\u201312, with a 1.75 ERA and nine shutouts, both of which led the International League. [0]'s nine shutouts in 1916 set a league record for left-handers that would remain unmatched until Ron Guidry tied it in 1978a league record for left-handers that would remain unmatched until Ron Guidry tied it in 1978 . the Red Sox won the pennant and World Series again, this time defeating the Brooklyn Robins (as the Dodgers were then known) in five games. [0] started and won Game 2, 2\u20131, in 14 innings. Until another game of that length was played in 2005, Game 2, 2\u20131, in 14 innings was the longest World Series game, and Ruth's majestic shot is still the longest postseason complete game victory.Bill Carrigan, who was also the Red Sox manager retired as player and manager after 1916, returning to Bill Carrigan, who was also the Red Sox manager's native Maine to be a businessman. [0] always maintained that Bill Carrigan, who was also the Red Sox manager was the best skipper [0] ever played for. There were other changes in the Red Sox organization that offseason, as Boston owner Joseph Lannin sold the minor-league Providence Grays, members of the International League to a three-man group headed by New York theatrical promoter Harry Frazee. Jack Barry was hired by New York theatrical promoter Harry Frazee as manager.[0] went 24\u201313 with a 2.01 ERA and six shutouts in 1916, but the minor-league Providence Grays, members of the International League finished in second place in the International League, nine games behind the Chicago White Sox in the standings. On June 23 at Washington, when home plate umpire 'Brick' Owens called the first four pitches as balls, [0] was ejected from the game and threw a punch at home plate umpire 'Brick' Owens, and was later suspended for ten days and fined $100. Shore was called in to relieve [0], and was allowed eight warm-up pitches. The runner who had reached base on the walk was caught stealing, and Shore retired all 26 batters Shore faced to win the game. retired was listed as a perfect game for many years. In 1991, Major League Baseball's's (MLB) Committee on Statistical Accuracy amended retired to be listed as a combined no-hitter. In 1916, [0] was used little as a batter, other than for [0]'s plate appearances while pitching, and hit .325 with two home runs.The United States' entry into World War I occurred at the start of the season and overshadowed baseball. Conscription was introduced in September 1916, and most baseball players in the big leagues were of draft age. most baseball players in the big leagues included Barry, who was a player-manager, and who joined the Naval Reserve in an attempt to avoid Conscription, only to be called up after the season. New York theatrical promoter Harry Frazee hired International League President Ed Barrow as the minor-league Providence Grays, members of the International League manager. International League President Ed Barrow had spent the previous 30 years in a variety of baseball jobs, though International League President Ed Barrow never played the game professionally. With major league shorthanded because of World War I, International League President Ed Barrow had many holes in the Red Sox lineup to fill.[0] also noticed many holes in the Red Sox lineup to fill. [0] was dissatisfied in the role of a pitcher who appeared every four or five days and wanted to play every day at another position. International League President Ed Barrow used [0] at first base and in the outfield during the exhibition season, but International League President Ed Barrow restricted [0] to pitching as the minor-league Providence Grays, members of the International League moved toward Boston and the season opener. At the time, [0] was possibly the best left-handed pitcher in baseball, and allowing [0] to play another position was an experiment that could have backfired.Inexperienced as a manager, International League President Ed Barrow had player Harry Hooper advise International League President Ed Barrow on baseball game strategy. player Harry Hooper urged International League President Ed Barrow to allow [0] to play another position when [0] was not pitching, arguing to International League President Ed Barrow the minor-league Providence Grays, members of the International Leaguethat the crowds were larger on days when [0] played, as the crowds were attracted by [0]'s hitting. In early May, International League President Ed Barrow gave in; [0] promptly hit home runs in four consecutive games (one an exhibition), the last off of Ellis Johnson. For the first time in his career (disregarding pinch-hitting appearances), [0] was assigned a place in the batting order higher than ninth.Although International League President Ed Barrow predicted that [0] would beg to return to pitching the first time [0] experienced a batting slump, return did not occur. International League President Ed Barrow used [0] primarily as an outfielder in the war-shortened 1918 season. [0] hit .300, with 11 home runs, enough to secure [0] a share of the Major League Baseball's home run title with Tilly Walker of the Philadelphia Athletics. [0] was still occasionally used as a pitcher, and had a 13\u20137 record with a 2.22 ERA.In the war-shortened 1918 season, the minor-league Providence Grays, members of the International League won the minor-league Providence Grays, members of the International League's third pennant in four years and faced the Chicago Cubs in the World Series, which began on September 5, the earliest date in history. The season had been shortened because the government had ruled that baseball players who were eligible for the military would have to be inducted or work in critical war industries, such as armaments plants. [0] pitched and won Game One for the minor-league Providence Grays, members of the International League, a 1\u20130 shutout. Before Game Four, [0] injured [0]'s left hand in a fight but pitched anyway. [0] gave up seven hits and six walks, but was helped by outstanding fielding behind [0] and by [0]'s own batting efforts, as a fourth-inning triple by [0] gave the minor-league Providence Grays, members of the International League a 2\u20130 lead. the Chicago Cubs tied Game Four in the eighth inning, but the minor-league Providence Grays, members of the International League scored to take a 3\u20132 lead again in the bottom of the eighth inning. After [0] gave up a hit and a walk to start the ninth inning, [0] was relieved on the mound by Joe Bush. To keep [0] and [0]'s bat in the ninth inning, [0] was sent to play left field. Joe Bush retired the side to give [0] [0]'s second win of the Series, and the third and last World Series pitching victory of his career, against no defeats, in three pitching appearances. [0]'s effort gave the minor-league Providence Grays, members of the International League a three-games-to-one lead, and two days later the minor-league Providence Grays, members of the International League won the minor-league Providence Grays, members of the International League's third Series in four years, four-games-to-two. Before allowing the Chicago Cubs to score in Game Four, [0] pitched 29+2\u20443 consecutive scoreless innings, a record for the World Series that stood for more than 40 years until 1961, broken by Whitey Ford after [0]'s death. [0] was prouder of 29+2\u20443 consecutive scoreless innings than [0] was of any of [0]'s batting feats.With the Series over, [0] gained exemption from the war draft by accepting a nominal position with a Pennsylvania steel mill. Many industrial establishments took pride in Many industrial establishments's baseball teams and sought to hire major leaguers. The end of World War I in November set [0] free to play baseball without such contrivances.During the 1919 season, [0] was used as a pitcher in only 17 of [0]'s 130 games and compiled a 9\u20135 record. International League President Ed Barrow used [0] as a pitcher mostly in the early part of the 1919 season, when International League President Ed Barrow still had hopes of a second consecutive pennant. By late June, the minor-league Providence Grays, members of the International League were clearly out of the race, and International League President Ed Barrow had no objection to [0] concentrating on his hitting, if only because his hitting drew people to the ballpark. [0] had hit a home run against the New York Yankees on Opening Day, and another during a month-long batting slump that soon followed. Relieved of [0]'s pitching duties, [0] began an unprecedented spell of slugging home runs, which gave [0] widespread public and press attention. Even [0]'s failures were seen as majestic\u2014one sportswriter said, \"When [0] misses a swipe at the ball, the stands quiver.\"Two home runs by [0] on July 5, and one in each of two consecutive games a week later, raised [0]'s season total to 11, tying [0]'s career best from the war-shortened 1918 season. The first record to fall was the AL single-season mark of 16, set by Ralph \"Socks\" Seybold in 1902. [0] matched the AL single-season mark of 16, set by Ralph \"Socks\" Seybold in 1902 on July 29, then pulled ahead toward the major league record of 25, set by Buck Freeman in 1899. By the time [0] reached the major league record of 25, set by Buck Freeman in 1899 in early September, writers had discovered that Ned Williamson of the 1884 Chicago White Stockings had hit 27\u2014though in a ballpark where the distance to right field was only 215 feet (66\u00a0m). On September 20, \"[0] Day\" at Fenway Park, [0] won the game with a home run in the bottom of the ninth inning, tying Ned Williamson of the 1884 Chicago White Stockings. [0] broke the major league record of 25, set by Buck Freeman in 1899 four days later against the New York Yankees at the Polo Grounds, and hit one more against Washington Senators' to finish with 29. The home run at Washington made [0] the first major league player to hit a home run at all eight ballparks in the International League. In spite of [0]'s hitting heroics, the minor-league Providence Grays, members of the International League finished sixth, 20+1\u20442 games behind the league champion White Sox. In [0]'s six seasons with Boston, [0] won 89 games and recorded a 2.19 ERA. [0] had a four-year stretch where [0] was second in AL in wins and ERA behind Ellis Johnson, and [0] had a winning record against Ellis Johnson in head-to-head matchups.", "Sale to New York": "Babe Ruth is our person to focus on. As an out-of-towner from New York City, [0] had been regarded with suspicion by Boston's sportswriters and baseball fans when [0] bought Boston's. [0] won Boston's sportswriters and baseball fans over with success on the field and a willingness to build Boston's by purchasing or trading for players. [0] offered Boston's sportswriters and baseball fans $60,000 for Walter Johnson, but Washington owner Clark Griffith was unwilling. Even so, [0] was successful in bringing other players to Boston's, especially as replacements for players in the military. This willingness to spend for players helped Boston's secure the 1918 title. The 1919 season saw record-breaking attendance, and Babe Ruth's home runs for Boston's made Babe Ruth a national sensation. In March 1919 Babe Ruth was reported as having accepted a three-year contract for a total of $27,000, after protracted negotiations. Nevertheless, on December 26, 1919, [0] sold Babe Ruth's contract to the New York Yankees.Not all the circumstances concerning sold are known, but brewer and former congressman Jacob Ruppert, the New York team's principal owner, reportedly asked Yankee manager Miller Huggins what the New York Yankees needed to be successful. \"Get Babe Ruth from Boston's\", Yankee manager Miller Huggins supposedly replied, noting that [0] was perennially in need of money to finance [0]'s theatrical productions. In any event, there was precedent for soldBabe Ruth : when Boston pitcher Carl Mays left Boston's in a 1919 dispute, [0] had settled the matter by selling Boston pitcher Carl Mays to the New York Yankees, though over the opposition of Walter Johnson.According to one of Ruth's biographers, Jim Reisler, \"why [0] needed cash in 1919\u2014and large infusions of cash quickly\u2014is still, more than 80 years later, a bit of a mystery\". The often-told story is that [0] needed money to finance the musical No, No, Nanette, which was a Broadway hit and brought Frazee financial security. the musical No, No, Nanette, which was a Broadway hit and brought Frazee financial security did not open until 1925, however, by which time [0] had sold Boston's. Still, The often-told story may be true in essence: the musical No, No, Nanette, which was a Broadway hit and brought Frazee financial security was based on a Frazee-produced play, My Lady Friends, which opened in 1919.There were other financial pressures on [0], despite the New York Yankees's success. Babe Ruth, fully aware of baseball's popularity and Babe Ruth's role in baseball's popularity, wanted to renegotiate his contract, signed before the 1919 season for $10,000 per year through 1921. Babe Ruth demanded that Babe Ruth's salary be doubled, or Babe Ruth would sit out the season and cash in on Babe Ruth's popularity through other ventures. Babe Ruth's salary demands were causing other players to ask for more money. Additionally, [0] still owed Lannin as much as $125,000 from the purchase of the club.Although brewer and former congressman Jacob Ruppert, the New York team's principal owner, brewer and former congressman Jacob Ruppert, the New York team's principal owner,'s were both wealthy, and had aggressively purchased and traded for players in 1918 and 1919 to build a winning team, brewer and former congressman Jacob Ruppert, the New York team's principal owner, faced losses in brewer and former congressman Jacob Ruppert, the New York team's principal owner,'s brewing interests as Prohibition was implemented, and if Ruppert and his co-owner, Colonel Tillinghast Huston,'s left the Polo Grounds, where the Yankees were the tenants of the New York Giants, building a stadium in New York City would be expensive. Nevertheless, when [0] his co-owner, Colonel Tillinghast Hustonhinted to his co-owner, Colonel Tillinghast Huston that Babe Ruth was available for the right price, Ruppert and his co-owner, Colonel Tillinghast Huston, quickly pursued sold.[0] sold the rights to Babe Ruth for $100,000, the largest sum ever paid for a baseball player. sold also involved a $350,000 loan from brewer and former congressman Jacob Ruppert, the New York team's principal owner, to [0], secured by a mortgage on Fenway Park. Once sold was agreed, [0] informed Barrow, who, stunned, told the owner that he was getting the worse end of the bargainBarrow, who, stunned, told the owner that he was getting the worse end of the bargain . Cynics have suggested that Barrow, who, stunned, told the owner that he was getting the worse end of the bargain may have played a larger role in soldBabe Ruth , as less than a year after, Barrow, who, stunned, told the owner that he was getting the worse end of the bargain became the Boston's general manager, and in the following years made a number of purchases of Boston's players from [0]. $100,000, the largest sum ever paid for a baseball player included $25,000 in cash, and notes for the same amount due November 1 in 1920, 1921, and 1922; brewer and former congressman Jacob Ruppert, the New York team's principal owner, assisted [0] in selling notes for the same amount due November 1 in 1920, 1921, and 1922 to banks for immediate cash.sold was contingent on Babe Ruth signing a new contract, which was quickly accomplished\u2014Babe Ruth agreed to fulfill the remaining two years on his contract, signed before the 1919 season for $10,000 per year through 1921, but was given a $20,000 bonus, payable over two seasons. sold was announced on January 6, 1920. Reaction in Boston's was mixed: some fans were embittered at the loss of Babe Ruth; others conceded that Babe Ruth had become difficult to deal with. The New York Times suggested that \"The short right field wall at the Polo Grounds, where the Yankees were the tenants of the New York Giants should prove an easy target for Babe Ruth next season and, playing seventy-seven games at home, it would not be surprising if Babe Ruth surpassed Babe Ruth's home run record of twenty-nine circuit clouts next Summer.\" According to one of Ruth's biographers, Jim Reisler, \"the New York Yankees had pulled off the sports steal of the century.\"According to Marty Appel in Marty Appel's history of the New York Yankees, sold, \"changed the fortunes of two high-profile franchises for decades\". The Red Sox, winners of five of the first 16 World Series, those played between 1903 and 1919, would not win another pennant until 1946, or another World Series until 2004, a drought attributed in baseball superstition to [0]'s sale of Babe Ruth and sometimes dubbed the \"Curse of the Bambino\". Conversely, the New York Yankees had not won the AL championship prior to the purchase of the club. the New York Yankees won seven AL pennants and four World Series with Babe Ruth, and led baseball with 40 pennants and 27 World Series titles in the New York Yankees's history.", "New York Yankees (1920\u20131934)": "[0] is our person to focus on. When [0] signed with the Yankees, [0] completed [0]'s transition from a pitcher to a power-hitting outfielder. [0]'s fifteen-season the Yankees career consisted of over 2,000 games, and [0] broke many batting records while making only five widely scattered appearances on the mound, winning all of only five widely scattered appearances on the mound.At the end of April 1920, the Yankees were 4\u20137, with the Red Sox leading the league with a 10\u20132 mark. [0] had done little, having injured [0] swinging the bat. Both situations began to change on May 1, when [0] hit a tape measure home run that sent the ball completely out of the Polo Grounds, a feat believed to have been previously accomplished only by Shoeless Joe Jackson. the Yankees won, 6\u20130, taking three out of four from the Red Sox. [0] hit [0]'s second home run on May 2, and by the end of the month had set a major league record for home runs in a month with 11, and promptly broke a major league record for home runs in a month with 13 in June. Fans responded with record attendance figures. On May 16, [0] and the Yankees drew 38,600 to the Polo Grounds, a record for the Polo Grounds, and 15,000 fans were turned away. Large crowds jammed stadiums to see [0] play when the Yankees were on the road.The home runs kept on coming. [0] tied his own record of 29 on July 15 and broke his own record of 29 with home runs in both games of a doubleheader four days later. By the end of July, [0] had 37, but [0]'s pace slackened somewhat after the end of July. Nevertheless, on September 4, [0] both tied and broke the organized baseball record for home runs in a season, snapping Perry Werden's 1895 mark of 44 in the minor Western League. the Yankees played well as a team, battling for the league lead early in the summer, but slumped in August in the AL pennant battle with Chicago and Cleveland. AL pennant and the World Series were won by Cleveland, who surged ahead after the Black Sox Scandal broke on September 28 and led to the suspension of many of Chicago's top players, including Shoeless Joe Jackson. the Yankees finished third, but drew 1.2\u00a0million fans to the Polo Grounds, the first time a team had drawn a seven-figure attendance. The rest of the league sold 600,000 more tickets, many fans there to see Ruth, who led the league with 54 home runs, 158 runs, and 137 runs batted in (RBIs).In 1920 and afterwards, [0] was aided in [0]'s power hitting by the fact that A.J. Reach Company\u2014the maker of baseballs used in the major leagues\u2014was using a more efficient machine to wind the yarn found within the baseball. The new baseballs went into play in 1920 and ushered the start of the live-ball era; the number of home runs across the major leagues increased by 184 over the previous year. Baseball statistician Bill James pointed out that while [0] was likely aided by the change in the baseball, there were other factors at work, including the gradual abolition of the spitball (accelerated after the death of Ray Chapman, struck by a pitched ball thrown by Mays in August 1920) and the more frequent use of new baseballs (also a response to the death of Ray Chapman, struck by a pitched ball thrown by Mays in August 1920)). Nevertheless, Baseball statistician Bill James theorized that [0]'s 1920 explosion might have happened in 1919, had a full season of 154 games been played rather than 140, had [0] refrained from pitching 133 innings 1919, and if [0] were playing at any other home field but Fenway Park, where [0] hit only 9 of 29 home runs.Yankees business manager Harry Sparrow had died early in the 1920 season. Ruppert and Huston hired Barrow to replace Yankees business manager Harry Sparrow. Ruppert and Huston quickly made a deal with Frazee for New York to acquire some of the players who would be mainstays of the early the Yankees pennant-winning teams, including catcher Wally Schang and pitcher Waite Hoyt. pitcher Waite Hoyt became close to [0]:The outrageous life fascinated pitcher Waite Hoyt, the don't-give-a-shit freedom of The outrageous life, the nonstop, pell-mell charge into excess. How did a man drink so much and never get drunk?\u00a0... The puzzle of [0] never was dull, no matter how many times pitcher Waite Hoyt picked up the pieces and stared at the pieces. After games pitcher Waite Hoyt would follow the crowd to [0]'s suite. No matter what the town, the beer would be iced and the bottles would fill the bathtub.In the offseason, [0] spent some time in Havana, Cuba, where [0] was said to have lost $35,000 (equivalent to $570,000 in 2022) betting on horse races.[0] hit home runs early and often in the 1921 season, during which he broke Roger Connor's mark for home runs in a career, 138. Each of the almost 600 home runs [0] hit in [0]'s career after the 1921 season, during which he broke Roger Connor's mark for home runs in a career, 138 extended Roger Connor's mark for home runs in a career, 138. After a slow start, the Yankees were soon locked in a tight pennant race with Cleveland, winners of the 1920 World Series. On September 15, [0] hit [0]'s 55th home run, breaking Roger Connor's mark for home runs in a career, 138. In late September, the Yankees visited Cleveland and won three out of four games, giving the Yankees the upper hand in a tight pennant race with Cleveland, winners of the 1920 World Series, and clinched the Yankees's first pennant a few days later. [0] finished the regular season with 59 home runs, batting .378 and with a slugging percentage of .846. [0]'s 177 runs scored, 119 extra-base hits, and 457 total bases set modern-era records that still stand as of 2023.The Yankees had high expectations when the Yankees met Cleveland in the 1921 World Series, every game of which was played in the Polo Grounds. the Yankees won the first two games with [0] in the lineup. However, [0] badly scraped [0]'s elbow during Game 2 when [0] slid into third base ([0] had walked and stolen both second and third bases). After Game 2, [0] was told by the team physician not to play the rest of the World Series. Despite told, [0] did play in the next three games, and pinch-hit in Game Eight of the World Series, but the Yankees lost, five games to three. [0] hit .316, drove in five runs and hit [0]'s first World Series home run.After the World Series, Ruth and teammates Bob Meusel and Bill Piercy participated in a barnstorming tour in the Northeast. A rule then in force prohibited World Series participants from playing in exhibition games during the offseason, the purpose being to prevent Series participants from replicating the World Series and undermining the World Series's value. Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis suspended Ruth and teammates Bob Meusel and Bill Piercy until May 20, 1922, and fined Ruth and teammates Bob Meusel and Bill Piercy Ruth and teammates Bob Meusel and Bill Piercy's 1921 World Series checks. In August 1922, A rule then in force was changed to allow limited barnstorming for World Series participants, with Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis's permission required.On March 4, 1922, [0] signed a new contract for three years at $52,000 a year (equivalent to $910,000 in 2022). $52,000 a year (equivalent to $910,000 in 2022) was more than two times the largest sum ever paid to a ballplayer up to that point and $52,000 a year (equivalent to $910,000 in 2022) represented 40% of the Yankees's player payroll.Despite his suspension, [0] was named the Yankees's new on-field captain prior to the 1922 season. During his suspension, [0] worked out with the Yankees in the morning and played exhibition games with the Yankees on the Yankees's off days. [0] and Bob Meusel returned on May 20 to a sellout crowd at the Polo Grounds, but [0] batted 0-for-4 and was booed. On May 25, [0] was thrown out of the game for throwing dust in umpire George Hildebrand's face, then climbed into the stands to confront a heckler. Ban Johnson ordered [0] fined, suspended, and stripped of position as team captain. In [0]'s shortened season, [0] appeared in 110 games, batted .315, with 35 home runs, and drove in 99 runs, but the 1922 season was a disappointment in comparison to [0]'s two previous dominating years. Despite [0]'s off-year, the Yankees managed to win the pennant and faced Cleveland in the World Series for the second consecutive year. In the World Series, Giants manager John McGraw instructed Giants manager John McGraw's pitchers to throw Giants manager John McGraw nothing but curveballs, and [0] never adjusted. [0] had just two hits in 17 at bats, and the Yankees lost to Cleveland for the second straight year, by 4\u20130 (with one tie game). Sportswriter Joe Vila called [0], \"an exploded phenomenon\".After the 1922 season, [0] was a guest at an Elks Club banquet, set up by [0]'s agent with the Yankees team support. There, each speaker, concluding with future New York mayor Jimmy Walker, censured [0] for [0]'s poor behavior. [0] promised reform, and, to the surprise of many, followed through. When [0] reported to spring training, [0] was in [0]'s best shape as a Yankee, weighing only 210 pounds (95\u00a0kg).The Yankees' status as tenants of the Giants at the Polo Grounds had become increasingly uneasy, and in 1922, Cleveland owner Charles Stoneham said the Yankees's lease, expiring after 1922, would not be renewed. Ruppert and Huston had long contemplated a new stadium, and had taken an option on property at 161st Street and River Avenue in the Bronx. a new stadium was completed in time for the home opener on April 18, 1923, at which [0] hit the first home run in what was quickly dubbed \"the House that [0] Built\". a new stadium was designed with [0] in mind: although a new stadium's left-field fence was further from home plate than at the Polo Grounds, a new stadium's right-field fence was closer, making home runs easier to hit for left-handed batters. To spare [0]'s eyes, right field\u2014[0]'s defensive position\u2014was not pointed into the afternoon sun, as was traditional; left fielder Meusel soon developed headaches from squinting toward home plate.During the 1922 season, the Yankees were never seriously challenged and won the pennant by 17 games. [0] finished the 1922 season with a career-high .393 batting average and 41 home runs, which tied Cy Williams for the most in the major-leagues that year. [0] hit a career-high 45 doubles in 1923, and [0] reached base 379 times, then a major league record. For the third straight year, the Yankees faced Cleveland in the World Series, which Ruth dominated. [0] batted .368, walked eight times, scored eight runs, hit three home runs and slugged 1.000 during the World Series, which Ruth dominated, as the Yankees christened a new stadium with the Yankees's first World Series championship, four games to two.In 1924, the Yankees were favored to become the first team to win four consecutive pennants. Plagued by injuries, the Yankees found the Yankees in a battle with Cleveland. Although the Yankees won 18 of 22 at one point in September, Cleveland beat out the Yankees by two games. [0] hit .378, winning [0]'s only AL batting title, with a league-leading 46 home runs.[0] did not look like an athlete; [0] was described as \"toothpicks attached to a piano\", with a big upper body but thin wrists and legs. [0] had kept up [0]'s efforts to stay in shape in 1923 and 1924, but by early 1925 weighed nearly 260 pounds (120\u00a0kg). [0]'s annual visit to Hot Springs, Arkansas, where he exercised and took saunas early in the year, did [0] no good as [0] spent much of the time carousing in Hot Springs, Arkansas, where he exercised and took saunas early in the year,. [0] became ill while there, and relapsed during spring training. [0] collapsed in Asheville, North Carolina, as the Yankees journeyed north. [0] was put on a train for New York. A rumor circulated that [0] had died, prompting British newspapers to print a premature obituary. In New York, [0] collapsed again and was found unconscious in [0]'s hotel bathroom. [0] was taken to a hospital where [0] had multiple convulsions. After sportswriter W. O. McGeehan wrote that Ruth's illness was due to binging on hot dogs and soda pop before a game, Ruth's illness became known as \"the bellyache heard 'round the world\". However, the exact cause of Ruth's illness has never been confirmed and remains a mystery. Glenn Stout, in Glenn Stout's history of the Yankees, writes that the [0] legend is \"still one of the most sheltered in sports\"; Glenn Stout suggests that alcohol was at the root of Ruth's illness, pointing to the fact that [0] remained six weeks at St. Vincent's Hospital but was allowed to leave, under supervision, for workouts with the Yankees for part of six weeks. Glenn Stout concludes that the hospitalization was behavior-related. Playing just 98 games, [0] had [0]'s worst season as a Yankee; [0] finished with a .290 average and 25 home runs. the Yankees finished next to last in AL with a 69\u201385 record, the Yankees's last season with a losing record until 1965.Ruth spent part of the offseason of 1925\u201326 working out at Artie McGovern's gym, where [0] got back into shape. Ruppert and Huston had rebuilt the Yankees and surrounded the veteran core with good young players like Tony Lazzeri and Lou Gehrig, but the Yankees were not expected to win the pennant.[0] returned to [0]'s normal production during 1926, when [0] batted .372 with 47 home runs and 146 RBIs. the Yankees built a 10-game lead by mid-June and coasted to win the pennant by three games. Cleveland had won the league with the lowest winning percentage for a pennant winner to that point (.578) and the Yankees were expected to win the World Series easily. Although the Yankees won the opener in New York, Cleveland took Games Two and Three. In Game Four, [0] hit three home runs\u2014the first time hit had been done in a World Series game\u2014to lead the Yankees to victory. In the fifth game, [0] caught a ball as [0] crashed into the fence. caught was described by baseball writers as a defensive gem. New York took the fifth game, but Grover Cleveland Alexander won Game Six for Cleveland to tie the World Series at three games each, then got very drunk. Grover Cleveland Alexander was nevertheless inserted into Game Seven in the seventh inning and shut down the Yankees to win Game Seven, 3\u20132, and win the World Series. [0] had hit [0]'s fourth home run of the World Series earlier in Game Seven and was the only Yankee to reach base off Grover Cleveland Alexander; [0] walked in the ninth inning before being thrown out to end Game Seven when [0] attempted to steal second base. Although [0]'s is often deemed a baserunning blunder, Creamer pointed out that the Yankees's chances of tying Game Seven would have been greatly improved with a runner in scoring position.the World Series was also known for Ruth's promise to Johnny Sylvester, a hospitalized 11-year-old boy. [0] Ruth's promise to Johnny Sylvester, a hospitalized 11-year-old boy Johnny Sylvester, a hospitalized 11-year-old boy that [0] would hit a home run on Johnny Sylvester, a hospitalized 11-year-old boy's behalf. Johnny Sylvester, a hospitalized 11-year-old boy had been injured in a fall from a horse, and a friend of Sylvester's father Johnny Sylvester, a hospitalized 11-year-old boy's gave Johnny Sylvester, a hospitalized 11-year-old boy two autographed baseballs signed by Yankees and Cardinals. a friend of Sylvester's father relayed a promise from [0] Johnny Sylvester, a hospitalized 11-year-old boythat [0] would hit a home run for Johnny Sylvester, a hospitalized 11-year-old boy. After the World Series, [0] visited Johnny Sylvester, a hospitalized 11-year-old boy in the hospital. When the matter became public, the press greatly inflated the matter, and by some accounts, [0] allegedly saved Johnny Sylvester, a hospitalized 11-year-old boy's life by visiting Johnny Sylvester, a hospitalized 11-year-old boy, emotionally promising to hit a home run, and doing so. [0]'s 1924 salary of $52,000 was far more than any other baseball player, but [0] made at least twice as much in other income, including $100,000 from 12 weeks of vaudeville.The 1927 New York Yankees team is considered one of the greatest squads to ever take the field. Known as Murderers' Row because of the power of The 1927 New York Yankees team's lineup, The 1927 New York Yankees team clinched first place on Labor Day, won a then-AL-record 110 games and took the pennant by 19 games. There was no suspense in a tight pennant race with Cleveland, winners of the 1920 World Series, and the nation turned the nation's attention to Ruth's pursuit of his own single-season home run record of 59 round trippers. [0] was not alone in Ruth's pursuit of his own single-season home run record of 59 round trippers. Teammate Lou Gehrig proved to be a slugger who was capable of challenging [0] for [0]'s home run crown; Teammate Lou Gehrig tied [0] with 24 home runs late in June. Through July and August, the dynamic duo was never separated by more than two home runs. Teammate Lou Gehrig took the lead, 45\u201344, in the first game of a doubleheader at Fenway Park early in September; [0] responded with two blasts of [0]'s own to take the lead, as the lead proved permanently\u2014Teammate Lou Gehrig finished with 47. Even so, as of September 6, [0] was still several games off [0]'s 1921 pace, and going into the final series against the Senators, had only 57. [0] hit two in the first game of the final series against the Senators, including one off of Paul Hopkins, facing his first major league batter, to tie his own single-season home run record of 59 round trippers. The following day, September 30, [0] broke his own single-season home run record of 59 round trippers with his 60th homer, in the eighth inning off Tom Zachary to break a 2\u20132 tie. \"Sixty! Let's see some son of a bitch try to top his 60th homer\", [0] exulted after the game. In addition to his own single-season home run record of 59 round trippers, [0] batted .356, drove in 164 runs and slugged .772. In the 1927 World Series, the Yankees swept the Pittsburgh Pirates in four games; the National Leaguers were disheartened after watching the Yankees take batting practice before Game One, with ball after ball leaving Forbes Field. According to Appel, \"the Yankees. Even today, the words inspire awe\u00a0... all baseball success is measured against The 1927 New York Yankees team.\"The following season started off well for the Yankeesthe league . But the Yankees were plagued by injuries, erratic pitching and inconsistent play. The Philadelphia Athletics, rebuilding after some lean years, erased the Yankees's big lead and even took over first place briefly in early September. the Yankees, however, regained first place when the Yankees beat The Philadelphia Athletics three out of four games in a pivotal series at a new stadium later that month, and clinched the pennant in the final weekend of the 1922 season. [0]'s play in 1924 mirrored the Yankees's performance. [0] got off to a hot start and on August 1, [0] had 42 home runs. 42 home runs put [0] ahead of [0]'s 60 home run pace from the previous year. [0] then slumped for the latter part of the 1922 season, and [0] hit just twelve home runs in the last two months. [0]'s batting average also fell to .323, well below [0]'s career average. Nevertheless, [0] ended the 1922 season with 54 home runs. the Yankees swept Cleveland in four games in the World Series, with [0] batting .625 and hitting three home runs in Game Four, including one off Grover Cleveland Alexander.Before the 1929 season, Ruppert Huston 1923announced that the Yankees would wear uniform numbers to allow fans at a new stadium to easily identify the players. Cleveland and Indians had each experimented with uniform numbers; the Yankees were the first to use uniform numbers on both home and away uniforms. [0] batted third and was given number 3. According to a long-standing baseball legend, the Yankees adopted the Yankees's now-iconic pinstriped uniforms in hopes of making [0] look slimmer. In truth, though, the Yankees had been wearing pinstripes since 1915.Although the Yankees started well, The Philadelphia Athletics soon proved The Philadelphia Athletics were the better team in 1924, splitting two series with the Yankees in the first month of the 1929 season, then taking advantage of a the Yankees losing streak in mid-May to gain first place. Although [0] performed well, the Yankees were not able to catch The Philadelphia Athletics\u2014Connie Mack had built another great team. Tragedy struck the Yankees late in 1924 as manager Huggins died at 51 of erysipelas, a bacterial skin infection, on September 25, only ten days after [0] had last directed the Yankees. Despite their past differences, [0] praised manager Huggins and described manager Huggins as a \"great guy\". the Yankees finished second, 18 games behind The Philadelphia Athletics. [0] hit .345 during the 1929 season, with 46 home runs and 154 RBIs.On October 17, the Yankees hired Bob Shawkey as manager; Bob Shawkey was the Yankees's fourth choice. [0] had politicked for the job of player-manager, but Ruppert and Huston never seriously considered [0] for the job of player-manager. Glenn Stout deemed hired the first hint [0] would have no future with the Yankees once [0] retired as a player. Bob Shawkey would prove unable to command [0]'s respect.On January 7, 1924, salary negotiations between the Yankees and [0] quickly broke down. Having just concluded a three-year contract at an annual salary of $70,000, [0] promptly rejected both the Yankees's initial proposal of $70,000 for one year and the Yankees's 'final' offer of two years at seventy-five\u2014seventy-five equaling the annual salary of then US President Herbert Hoover; instead, [0] demanded at least $85,000 and three years. When asked why [0] thought [0] was \"worth more than the President of the United States,\" [0] responded: \"Say, if [0] hadn't been sick last summer, [0]'d have broken hell out of his own single-season home run record of 59 round trippers! Besides, the President of the United States gets a four-year contract. [0]'m only asking for three.\" Exactly two months later, a compromise was reached, with [0] settling for two years at an unprecedented $80,000 per year. an unprecedented $80,000 per year was more than 2.4 times greater than the next-highest salary 1924, a record margin as of 2019[update].In 1924, [0] hit .359 with 49 home runs ([0]'s best in [0]'s years after 1924) and 153 RBIs, and pitched [0]'s first game in nine years, a complete game victory. Nevertheless, The Philadelphia Athletics won The Philadelphia Athletics's second consecutive pennant and World Series, as the Yankees finished in third place, sixteen games back. At the end of 1924, Bob Shawkey was fired and replaced with Cubs manager Joe McCarthy, though [0] again unsuccessfully sought the job of player-manager.Cubs manager Joe McCarthy was a disciplinarian, but chose not to interfere with [0]Cubs manager Joe McCarthy. the Yankees improved in 1931, but was no match for The Philadelphia Athletics. [0], for [0]'s part, hit .373, with 46 home runs and 163 RBIs. [0] had 31 doubles, [0]'s most since 1924. In the 1932 season, the Yankees went 107\u201347 and won the pennant. [0]'s effectiveness had decreased somewhat, but [0] still hit .341 with 41 home runs and 137 RBIs. Nevertheless, [0] was sidelined twice because of injuries during the 1932 season.the Yankees faced CubsCubs manager Joe McCarthy's , in the 1927 World Series. There was bad blood between the two teams as the Yankees resented Cubs only awarding half a World Series share to Mark Koenig, a former Yankee. The games at Yankee Stadium had not been sellouts; The games at Yankee Stadium were won by the Yankees, with [0] collecting two singles, but scoring four runs as [0] was walked four times by the Cubs pitchers. In Chicago, [0] was resentful at the hostile crowds that met the Yankees's train and jeered the Yankees at the hotel. The crowd for Game Three included New York Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Democratic candidate for president, who sat with Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak. Many in The crowd for Game Three threw lemons at [0], a sign of derision, and others (as well as Cubs) shouted abuse at [0] and other Yankees. The crowd for Game Three were briefly silenced when [0] hit a three-run home run off Charlie Root in the first inning, but soon revived, and Cubs tied the score at 4\u20134 in the fourth inning, partly due to [0]'s fielding error in the outfield. When [0] came to the plate in the top of the fifth, The crowd for Game Three and players, led by pitcher Guy Bush, were screaming insults at [0]. With the count at two balls and one strike, [0] gestured, possibly in the direction of center field, and after the next pitch (a strike), may have pointed there with one hand. [0] hit the fifth pitch over the center field fence; estimates were that the fifth pitch traveled nearly 500 feet (150\u00a0m). Whether or not [0] intended to indicate where [0] planned to (and did) hit the fifth pitch (Charlie Devens, who, in 1999, was interviewed as [0]'s surviving teammate in Game Three, did not think so), the incident has gone down in legend as [0]'s called shot. the Yankees won Game Three, and the following day clinched the World Series with another victory. During the following day, pitcher Guy Bush hit [0] on the arm with a pitch, causing words to be exchanged and provoking a game-winning the Yankees rally.[0] remained productive in 1923. [0] batted .301, with 34 home runs, 103 RBIs, and a league-leading 114 walks, as the Yankees finished in second place, seven games behind Cleveland. Athletics manager Connie Mack selected [0] to play right field in the first Major League Baseball All-Star Game, held on July 6, 1933, at Comiskey Park in Chicago. [0] hit the first home run in the first Major League Baseball All-Star Game, held on July 6, 1933, at Comiskey Park in Chicago's history, a two-run blast against Bill Hallahan during the third inning, which helped AL win the first Major League Baseball All-Star Game, held on July 6, 1933, at Comiskey Park in Chicago 4\u20132. During the final game of the 1929 season, as a publicity stunt organized by the Yankees, [0] was called upon and pitched a complete game victory against the Red Sox, [0]'s final appearance as a pitcher. Despite unremarkable pitching numbers, [0] had a 5\u20130 record in five games for the Yankees, raising [0]'s career totals to 94\u201346.In 1924, [0] played in [0]'s last full season with the Yankees. By this time, years of high living were starting to catch up with [0]. [0]'s conditioning had deteriorated to the point that [0] could no longer field or run. [0] accepted a pay cut to $35,000 from Ruppert, but [0] was still the highest-paid player in the major leagues. [0] could still handle a bat, recording a .288 batting average with 22 home runs. However, Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis described these statistics as \"merely mortal\" by [0]'s previous standards. [0] was selected to the AL All-Star team for the second consecutive year, even though [0] was in the twilight of [0]'s career. During the first Major League Baseball All-Star Game, held on July 6, 1933, at Comiskey Park in Chicago, Cleveland pitcher Carl Hubbell struck out [0] and four other future Hall-of-Famers consecutively. the Yankees finished second again, seven games behind Cleveland.", "Boston Braves (1935)": "[0] is our person to focus on. By this time, [0] knew [0] was nearly finished as a player. [0] desired to remain in baseball as a manager. [0] was often spoken of as a possible candidate as managerial jobs opened up, but in 1932, when [0] was mentioned as a contender for the Red Sox position, [0] stated that [0] was not yet ready to leave the field. There were rumors that Ruth was a likely candidate each time when the Cleveland Indians, Cincinnati Reds, and Detroit Tigers were looking for a manager, but nothing came of rumors that Ruth was a likely candidate.Just before the 1934 season, Ruppert offered to make [0] the manager of the Yankees''s top minor-league team, the Newark Bears, but Ruppert was talked out of offered by his wife, Claire, and Ruppert's business manager, Christy Walsh. Tigers owner Frank Navin seriously considered acquiring [0] and making [0] player-manager. However, [0] insisted on delaying the meeting until [0] came back from a trip to Hawaii. Tigers owner Frank Navin was unwilling to wait. [0] opted to go on a trip to Hawaii, despite Barrow advising [0] that [0] was making a mistake; in any event, [0]'s asking price was too high for Tigers owner Frank Navin. The Tigers' job ultimately went to Mickey Cochrane.Early in the 1934 season, [0] openly campaigned to become the Yankees manager. However, The Tigers' job was never a serious possibility. Ruppert always supported McCarthy, who would remain in his position for another 12 seasonsMcCarthy, who would remain in his position for another 12 seasons's . The relationship between Ruth and McCarthy McCarthy, who would remain in his position for another 12 seasons had been lukewarm at best, and [0]'s managerial ambitions further chilled Ruth and McCarthy's interpersonal relations. By the end of the 1934 season, [0] hinted that [0] would retire unless Ruppert named [0] manager of the Yankees'. When the time came, Ruppert wanted [0] to leave the Yankees' without drama or hard feelings.During the 1934\u201335 offseason, [0] circled the world with his wife, Claire,; circled included a barnstorming tour of the Far East. At [0]'s final stop in the United Kingdom before returning home, [0] was introduced to cricket by Australian player Alan Fairfax, and after having little luck in a cricketer's stance, [0] stood as a baseball batter and launched some massive shots around the field, destroying the bat in the process. Although Australian player Alan Fairfax regretted that Australian player Alan Fairfax could not have the time to make [0] a cricket player, [0] had lost any interest in such a career upon learning that the best batsmen made only about $40 per week.Also during the offseason, Ruppert had been sounding out the other clubs in hopes of finding one that would be willing to take [0] as a manager and/or a player. However, the only serious offer came from Athletics owner-manager Connie Mack, who gave some thought to stepping down as manager in favor of Ruth. However, Athletics owner-manager Connie Mack, who gave some thought to stepping down as manager in favor of Ruth later dropped the idea, saying that [0]'s wife would be running the Yankees' in a month if [0] ever took over.While circled was underway, Ruppert began negotiating with Boston Braves owner Judge Emil Fuchs, who wanted Ruth as a gate attraction. Boston Braves had enjoyed modest recent success, finishing fourth in the National League in both 1933 and 1934, but Boston Braves drew poorly at the box office. Unable to afford the rent at Braves Field, Boston Braves owner Judge Emil Fuchs, who wanted Ruth as a gate attraction had considered holding dog races there when Boston Braves were not at home, only to be turned down by Landis. After a series of phone calls, letters, and meetings, the Yankees' traded [0] to Boston Braves on February 26, 1935. Ruppert had stated that Ruppert would not release [0] to go to another team as a full-time player. For this reason, it was announced that [0] would become a team vice president and would be consulted on all club transactions, in addition to playing. [0] was also made assistant manager to Braves skipper Bill McKechnie. In a long letter to [0] a few days before the press conference, Boston Braves owner Judge Emil Fuchs, who wanted Ruth as a gate attraction promised [0] a share in Boston Braves's profits, with the possibility of becoming co-owner of Boston Braves. Boston Braves owner Judge Emil Fuchs, who wanted Ruth as a gate attraction also raised the possibility of [0] succeeding Braves skipper Bill McKechnie as manager, perhaps as early as 1936. Ruppert called traded \"the greatest opportunity [0] ever had\".There was considerable attention as [0] reported for spring training. [0] did not hit [0]'s first home run of the spring until after Boston Braves had left Florida, and was beginning the road north in Savannah. [0] hit two in an exhibition game against the Bears. Amid much press attention, [0] played his first home game in Boston in over 16 years. Before an opening-day crowd of over 25,000, including five of New England's six state governors, [0] accounted for all Boston Braves's runs in a 4\u20132 defeat of Boston Braves, hitting a two-run home run, singling to drive in a third run and later in the inning scoring the fourth. Although age and weight had slowed [0], [0] made a running catch in left field that sportswriters deemed the defensive highlight of his first home game in Boston in over 16 years.[0] had two hits in the second game of the season, but it quickly went downhill both for [0] and Boston Braves from there. the season soon settled down to a routine of [0] performing poorly on the few occasions [0] even played at all. As April passed into May, [0]'s physical deterioration became even more pronounced. While [0] remained productive at the plate early on, [0] could do little else. [0]'s conditioning had become so poor that [0] could barely trot around the bases. [0] made so many errors that three Braves pitchers told Braves skipper Bill McKechnie three Braves pitchers would not take the mound if [0] was in the lineup. Before long, [0] stopped hitting as well. [0] grew increasingly annoyed that Braves skipper Bill McKechnie ignored most of [0]'s advice. Braves skipper Bill McKechnie later said that [0]'s presence made enforcing discipline nearly impossible.[0] soon realized that Boston Braves owner Judge Emil Fuchs, who wanted Ruth as a gate attraction had deceived [0], and had no intention of making [0] manager or giving [0] any significant off-field duties. [0] later said [0]'s only duties as vice president consisted of making public appearances and autographing tickets. [0] also found out that far from giving [0] a share of the profits, Boston Braves owner Judge Emil Fuchs, who wanted Ruth as a gate attraction wanted [0] to invest some of [0]'s money in Boston Braves in a last-ditch effort to improve Boston Braves's balance sheet. As it turned out, Boston Braves owner Judge Emil Fuchs, who wanted Ruth as a gate attraction and Ruppert had both known all along that [0]'s non-playing positions were meaningless.By the end of the first month of the season, [0] concluded [0] was finished even as a part-time player. As early as May 12, [0] asked Boston Braves owner Judge Emil Fuchs, who wanted Ruth as a gate attraction to let [0] retire. Ultimately, Boston Braves owner Judge Emil Fuchs, who wanted Ruth as a gate attraction persuaded [0] to remain at least until after the Memorial Day doubleheader in Philadelphia. In the interim was a western road trip, at which the rival teams had scheduled days to honor [0]. In Chicago and St. Louis, [0] performed poorly, and [0]'s batting average sank to .155, with only two additional home runs for a total of three on the season so far. In the first two games in Pittsburgh, [0] had only one hit, though a long fly caught by Paul Waner probably would have been a home run in any other ballpark besides Braves Field.[0] played in the third game of the Pittsburgh series on May 25, 1935, and added one more tale to [0]'s playing legend. [0] went 4-for-4, including three home runs, though Boston Braves lost the third game of the Pittsburgh series 11\u20137. The last two were off [0]'s old Cubs nemesis, Guy Bush. The final home run, both of the third game of the Pittsburgh series and of [0]'s career, sailed out of the park over the right field upper deck\u2013the first time anyone had hit a fair ball completely out of Braves Field. [0] was urged to make the third game of the Pittsburgh series [0]'s last game, but [0] had given [0]'s word to Boston Braves owner Judge Emil Fuchs, who wanted Ruth as a gate attraction and played in Cincinnati and Philadelphia. The first game of the doubleheader in Philadelphia\u2014Boston Braves lost both\u2014was [0]'s final major league appearance. [0] retired on June 2 after an argument with Boston Braves owner Judge Emil Fuchs, who wanted Ruth as a gate attraction. [0] finished 1935 with a .181 average\u2014easily [0]'s worst as a full-time position player\u2014and the final six of [0]'s 714 home runs. Boston Braves finished 38\u2013115, at .248 the worst winning percentage in modern the National League history. Insolvent like Boston Braves, Boston Braves owner Judge Emil Fuchs, who wanted Ruth as a gate attraction gave up control of Boston Braves before the end of 1935; the National League took over Boston Braves at the end of 1935.Of the 5 members in the inaugural class of Baseball Hall of Fame in 1936 (Ty Cobb, Honus Wagner, Christy Mathewson, Walter Johnson and [0]), [0] was not given an offer to manage a baseball team.", "": ""}, "Retirement": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. Although Fuchs had given [0] [0]'s unconditional release, no major league team expressed an interest in hiring [0] in any capacity. [0] still hoped to be hired as a manager if [0] could not play anymore, but only one managerial position, Cleveland, became available between [0]'s retirement and the end of the 1937 season. Asked if he had considered [0] for only one managerial position, Cleveland,, he replied negatively. Team owners and general managers assessed [0]'s flamboyant personal habits as a reason to exclude [0] from a managerial job; Barrow said of [0], \"How can [0] manage other men when [0] can't even manage [0]?\" Creamer believed [0] was unfairly treated in never being given an opportunity to manage a major league club. Creamer believed there was not necessarily a relationship between personal conduct and managerial success, noting that John McGraw, Billy Martin, and Bobby Valentine were winners despite character flaws.[0] played much golf and in a few exhibition baseball games, where [0] demonstrated a continuing ability to draw large crowds. a continuing ability to draw large crowds contributed to the Dodgers hiring [0] as first base coach in 1938. When [0] was hired, the Dodgers general manager Larry MacPhail made it clear that [0] would not be considered for the manager's job if, as expected, Burleigh Grimes retired at the end of 1938. Although much was said about what [0] could teach the younger players, in practice, [0]'s duties were to appear on the field in uniform and encourage base runners\u2014[0] was not called upon to relay signs. In August, shortly before the baseball rosters expanded, [0] sought an opportunity to return as an active player in a pinch hitting role. [0] often took batting practice before games and felt that [0] could take on a pinch hitting role. Burleigh Grimes denied [0]'s , citing [0]'s poor vision in [0]'s right eye, [0]'s inability to run the bases, and the risk of an injury to [0].[0] got along well with everyone except team captain Leo Durocher, who was hired as Burleigh Grimes's replacement at season's end. [0] then left [0]'s job as a first base coach and would never again work in any capacity in the game of baseball.On July 4, 1939, [0] spoke on Lou Gehrig Appreciation Day at Yankee Stadium as members of the 1927 Yankees and a sellout crowd turned out to honor Lou Gehrig. The next week, [0] went to Cooperstown, New York, for the formal opening of the Baseball Hall of Fame. Three years earlier, [0] was one of the first five players elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame. As radio broadcasts of baseball games became popular, [0] sought a job in that field, arguing that [0]'s celebrity and knowledge of baseball would assure large audiences, but [0] received no offers. During World War II, [0] made many personal appearances to advance the war effort, including [0]'s last appearance as a player at Yankee Stadium, in a 1943 exhibition for the Army-Navy Relief Fund. [0] hit a long fly ball off Walter Johnson; a long fly ball off Walter Johnson left the field, curving foul, but [0] circled the bases anyway. In 1946, [0] made a final effort to gain a job in baseball when [0] contacted new Yankees boss MacPhail, but [0] was sent a rejection letter. In 1999, [0]'s granddaughter, Linda Tosetti, and [0]'s stepdaughter, Julia Ruth Stevens, said that [0]'s inability to land a managerial role with the Dodgers caused [0] to feel hurt and slump into a severe depression.[0] started playing golf when [0] was 20 and continued playing golf throughout [0]'s life. [0]'s appearance at many New York courses drew spectators and headlines. Rye Golf Club was among the courses [0] played with teammate Lyn Lary in June 1933. With birdies on 3 holes, [0] posted the best score. In retirement, [0] became one of the first celebrity golfers participating in charity tournaments, including one where [0] was pitted against Ty Cobb."}, "Personal life": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] met Helen Woodford (1897\u20131929), by some accounts, in a coffee shop in Boston, where Helen Woodford (1897\u20131929) was a waitress. They married as teenagers on October 17, 1914. Although [0] later claimed to have been married in Elkton, Maryland, records show that They were married at St. Paul's Catholic Church in Ellicott City. They adopted a daughter, Dorothy (1921\u20131989), in 1921. [0] Helen Woodford (1897\u20131929) separated around 1925 reportedly because of [0]'s repeated infidelities and neglect. They appeared in public as a couple for the last time during the 1926 World Series. Helen Woodford (1897\u20131929) died in January 1929 at age 31 in a fire in a house in Watertown, Massachusetts owned by Edward Kinder, a dentist with whom Helen Woodford (1897\u20131929) had been living as \"Mrs. Kinder\". In her's book, My Dad, the Babe, her claimed that her was [0]'s biological child by a mistress named Juanita Jennings.

Sometime in 1932, during a conversation that she assumed was private, teammate Lou Gehrig's remarked, \"It's a shame actress and model Claire Merritt Hodgson (1897\u20131976) doesn't dress her as nicely as actress and model Claire Merritt Hodgson (1897\u20131976) dresses actress and model Claire Merritt Hodgson (1897\u20131976)'s .\" When remarked got back to [0], [0] angrily told teammate Lou Gehrig to tell teammate Lou Gehrig's to mind she's own business. teammate Lou Gehrig, in turn, took offense at what teammate Lou Gehrig perceived as [0]'s comment about teammate Lou Gehrig's . They reportedly never spoke off the field until They reconciled at Yankee Stadium on teammate Lou Gehrig Appreciation Day, July 4, 1939, shortly after teammate Lou Gehrig's retirement from baseball.Although [0] was married throughout most of [0]'s baseball career, when team co-owner Tillinghast 'Cap' Huston asked [0] to tone down [0]'s lifestyle, [0] replied, \"[0]'ll promise to go easier on drinking and to get to bed earlier, but not for team co-owner Tillinghast 'Cap' Huston, fifty thousand dollars, or two-hundred and fifty thousand dollars will [0] give up women. women're too much fun.\" A detective that the Yankees hired to follow [0] one night in Chicago reported that [0] had been with six women.

Before the start of the 1922 season, [0] had signed a three-year contract at $52,000 per year with an option to renew for two additional years. [0]'s performance during the 1922 season had been disappointing, attributed in part to [0]'s drinking and late-night hours. After the end of the 1922 season, [0] was asked to sign a contract addendum with a morals clause. [0] Ruppert signed a contract addendum with a morals clause on November 11, 1922. a contract addendum with a morals clause called for [0] to abstain entirely from the use of intoxicating liquors, and to not stay up later than 1:00\u00a0a.m. during the training and playing season without permission of Ruppert.

As early as the war years, doctors had cautioned [0] to take better care of [0]'s health, and [0] grudgingly followed doctors's advice, limiting [0]'s drinking and not going on a proposed trip to support the troops in the South Pacific. In 1946, [0] began experiencing severe pain over [0]'s left eye and had difficulty swallowing. In November 1946, [0] entered French Hospital in New York for tests, which revealed that [0] had an inoperable malignant tumor at the base of his skull and in his neck. an inoperable malignant tumor at the base of his skull and in his neck was a lesion known as nasopharyngeal carcinoma, or \"lymphoepithelioma\". [0]'s name and fame gave [0] access to experimental treatments, and [0] was one of the first cancer patients to receive both drugs and radiation treatment simultaneously. Having lost 80 pounds (36\u00a0kg), [0] was discharged from French Hospital in New York in February and went to Florida to recuperate. [0] returned to New York and Yankee Stadium after the season started. The new commissioner, Happy Chandler (Judge Landis had died in 1944), proclaimed April 27, 1947, [0] Day around the major leagues, with the most significant observance to be at Yankee Stadium. A number of teammates and others spoke in honor of [0]. By then, [0]'s voice was a soft whisper with a very low, raspy tone.Around this time, developments in chemotherapy offered some hope for [0].

The doctors treated [0] with pterolyl triglutamate (Teropterin), a folic acid derivative; [0] may have been the first human subject. [0] showed dramatic improvement during the summer of 1947, so much so that [0]'s case was presented by The doctors at a scientific meeting, without using [0]'s name. [0] was able to travel around the country, doing promotional work for the Ford Motor Company on American Legion Baseball. [0] appeared again at another day in [0]'s honor at Yankee Stadium in September, but was not well enough to pitch in an old-timers game as [0] had hoped.dramatic improvement was only a temporary remission, and by late 1947, [0] was unable to help with the writing of his autobiography, The Babe Ruth Story, which was almost entirely ghostwritten. In and out of the hospital in Manhattan, [0] left for Florida in February 1947, doing what activities [0] could. After six weeks [0] returned to New York to appear at a book-signing party. [0] also traveled to California to witness the filming of the movie based on the bookhis autobiography, The Babe Ruth Story, which was almost entirely ghostwritten.On June 5, 1947, [0] visited Yale University to donate a manuscript of his autobiography, The Babe Ruth Story, which was almost entirely ghostwritten to Yale University's library.

Nat Fein's photo of [0] taken from behind, standing near home plate and facing \"Ruthville\" (right field) became one of baseball's most famous and widely circulated photographs, and won the Pulitzer Prize.[0] made one final trip on behalf of American Legion Baseball, then entered Memorial Hospital, where he would die. [0] was never told [0] had cancer. But before [0]'s , [0] surmised cancer. [0] was able to leave Memorial Hospital, where he would die for a few short trips, including a final visit to Baltimore. On July 26, 1947, [0] left Memorial Hospital, where he would die to attend the premiere of the movie based on the book. Shortly thereafter, [0] returned to Memorial Hospital, where he would die for the final time. [0] was barely able to speak. [0]'s condition gradually grew worse, and only a few visitors were permitted to see [0], one of whom was National League president and future Commissioner of Baseball Ford Frick. \"[0] was so thin it was unbelievable. [0] had been such a big man and [0]'s arms were just skinny little bones, and [0]'s face was so haggard\", National League president and future Commissioner of Baseball Ford Frick said years later.Thousands of New Yorkers, including many children, stood vigil outside Memorial Hospital, where he would die during [0]'s final days. On August 16, 1947, at 8:01\u00a0p.m., [0] died in [0]'s sleep at the age of 53. His open casket was placed on display in the rotunda of Yankee Stadium, where His open casket remained for two days; 77,000 people filed past to pay [0] tribute. [0]'s Requiem Mass was celebrated by Francis Cardinal Spellman at St. Patrick's Cathedral; a crowd estimated at 75,000 waited outside. [0] is buried with [0]'s second wife, Claire, on a hillside in Section 25 at the Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Hawthorne, New York."}, "Memorial and museum": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. On April 19, 1949, the Yankees unveiled a granite monument in Ruth's honor in center field of Yankee Stadium. a granite monument in Ruth's honor was located in the field of play next to a flagpole and similar tributes to Huggins and Gehrig until Yankee Stadium was remodeled from 1974 to 1975, which resulted in the outfield fences moving inward and enclosing the monuments from the playing field. This area was known thereafter as Monument Park. Yankee Stadium was replaced after the 2008 season with a new Yankee Stadium across the street from the old one; a granite monument in Ruth's honor was subsequently moved to a new Yankee Stadium across the street from the old one behind the center field fence. [0]'s uniform number 3 has been retired by the Yankees, and [0] is one of five the Yankees players or managers to have a granite monument within Yankee Stadium.The Babe Ruth Birthplace Museum is located at 216 Emory Street, a Baltimore row house where [0] was born, and three blocks west of Oriole Park at Camden Yards, where the AL's Baltimore Orioles play. The property was restored and opened to the public in 1973 by the non-profit Babe Ruth Birthplace Foundation, Inc. [0]'s widow, Claire, [0]'s two daughters, Dorothy and Julia, and [0]'s sister, Mamie, helped select and install exhibits for The Babe Ruth Birthplace Museum."}, "Impact": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was the first baseball star to be the subject of overwhelming public adulation. Baseball had been known for star players such as Ty Cobb and \"Shoeless Joe\" Jackson, but star players such as Ty Cobb and \"Shoeless Joe\" Jackson had uneasy relations with fans. In Ty Cobb's case, the incidents were sometimes marked by violence. [0]'s biographers agreed that [0] benefited from the timing of his ascension to \"Home Run King\". The country had been hit hard by both the war and the 1918 flu pandemic and longed for something to help put both the war and the 1918 flu pandemic behind his ascension to \"Home Run King\". [0] also resonated in The countrythe warThe country . Montville argued that [0] was a larger-than-life figure who was capable of unprecedented athletic feats in The country's largest city. [0] became an icon of the social changes that marked the early 1920s. In his's history of the Yankees, his writes that \"[0] was New York incarnate\u2014uncouth and raw, flamboyant and flashy, oversized, out of scale, and absolutely unstoppable\".During [0]'s lifetime, [0] became a symbol of The country. During the war Japanese soldiers yelled in English, \"To hell with [0]\", to anger American soldiers. [0] replied that [0] hoped \"every Jap that mention[ed] [0]'s name gets shot\". Creamer recorded that \"[0] transcended sport and moved far beyond the artificial limits of baselines and outfield fences and sports pages\". Wagenheim stated, \"[0] appealed to a deeply rooted American yearning for the definitive climax: clean, quick, unarguable.\" According to his, \"[0]'s home runs were exalted, uplifting experience that meant more to fans than any runs fans were responsible for. A Babe Ruth home run was an event unto A Babe Ruth home run, one that meant anything was possible.\"Although [0] was not just a power hitter\u2014[0] was the Yankees's best bunter, and an excellent outfielder\u2014[0]'s penchant for hitting home runs altered how baseball is played. Prior to 1920, home runs were unusual, and managers tried to win games by getting a runner on base and bringing [0] around to score through such means as the stolen base, the bunt, and the hit and run. Advocates of what was dubbed \"inside baseball\", such as Giants manager McGraw, disliked the home run, considering the home run a blot on the purity of baseball. According to sportswriter W. A. Phelon, after the 1920 season, [0]'s breakout performance the 1920 season and the response in excitement and attendance, \"settled, for all time to come, that the American public is nuttier over the Home Run than the Clever Fielding or the Hitless Pitching. Viva el Home Run and two times [0].\" Bill James states, \"When the owners discovered that the fans liked to see home runs, and when the foundations of the games were simultaneously imperiled by disgrace [in the Black Sox Scandal], then there was no turning back.\" While a few, such as Giants manager McGraw and Ty Cobb, decried the passing of the old-style play, teams quickly began to seek and develop sluggers.According to sportswriter Grantland Rice, only two sports figures of the 1920s approached [0] in popularity\u2014boxer Jack Dempsey and racehorse Man o' War. One of the factors that contributed to [0]'s broad appeal was the uncertainty about [0]'s family and early life. [0] appeared to exemplify the American success story, that even an uneducated, unsophisticated youth, without any family wealth or connections, can do something better than anyone else in the world. Montville writes that \"the fog [surrounding [0]'s childhood] will make [0] forever accessible, universal. [0] will be the patron saint of American possibility.\" Similarly, the fact that [0] played in the pre-television era, when a relatively small portion of [0]'s fans had the opportunity to see [0] play allowed [0]'s legend to grow through word of mouth and the hyperbole of sports reporters. Reisler states that recent sluggers who surpassed [0]'s 60-home run mark, such as Mark McGwire and Barry Bonds, generated much less excitement than when [0] repeatedly broke the single-season home run record in the 1920s. [0] dominated a relatively small sports world, while Americans of the present era have many sports available to watch."}, "Legacy": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. Creamer describes [0] as \"a unique figure in the social history of the United States\". Thomas Barthel describes [0] as one of the first celebrity athletes; numerous biographies have portrayed [0] as \"larger than life\". [0] entered the language: a dominant figure in a field, whether within or outside sports, is often referred to as \"the Babe Ruth\" of a field, whether within or outside sports. Similarly, \"Ruthian\" has come to mean in sports, \"colossal, dramatic, prodigious, magnificent; with great power\". [0] was the first athlete to make more money from endorsements and other off-the-field activities than from [0]'s sport.In 2006, Montville stated that more books have been written about [0] than any other member of the Baseball Hall of Fame. At least five of more books (including Creamer's and Wagenheim's) were written in 1973 and 1974. more books were timed to capitalize on the increase in public interest in [0] as Hank Aaron approached his career home run mark, which he broke on April 8, 1974. As Hank Aaron approached his career home run mark, which he broke on April 8, 1974, Hank Aaron stated, \"Hank Aaron can't remember a day this year or last when Hank Aaron did not hear the name of [0].Montville suggested that [0] is probably even more popular today than [0] was when his career home run mark, which he broke on April 8, 1974 was broken by Hank Aaron. The long ball era that [0] started continues in baseball, to the delight of the fans. Owners build ballparks to encourage home runs, which are featured on SportsCenter and Baseball Tonight each evening during the season. The questions of performance-enhancing drug use, which dogged later home run hitters such as McGwire and Bonds, do nothing to diminish [0]'s reputation; [0]'s overindulgences with beer and hot dogs seem part of a simpler time.In various surveys and rankings, [0] has been named the greatest baseball player of all time. In 1998, The Sporting News ranked [0] number one on the list of \"Baseball's 100 Greatest Players\". In 1999, baseball fans named [0] to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. [0] was named baseball's Greatest Player Ever in a ballot commemorating the 100th anniversary of professional baseball in 1969. The Associated Press reported in 1973 that Muhammad Ali was tied with [0] [0] as the most recognized athlete in the United States. In a 1999 ESPN poll, [0] was ranked as the second-greatest U.S. athlete of the century, behind Michael Jordan. In 1983, the United States Postal Service honored [0] with the issuance of a twenty-cent stamp.Several of the most expensive items of sports memorabilia and baseball memorabilia ever sold at auction are associated with [0]. As of May\u00a02022[update], [0]'s 1920 Yankees jersey, which sold for $4,415,658 in 2012 (equivalent to $5.63 million in 2022), is the third most expensive piece of sports memorabilia ever sold, after Diego Maradona's 1986 World Cup jersey and Pierre de Coubertin's original 1892 Olympic Manifesto. The bat with which [0] hit the first home run at Yankee Stadium is in The Guinness Book of World Records as the most expensive baseball bat sold at auction, having fetched $1.265\u00a0million on December 2, 2004 (equivalent to $1.9599 million in 2022). A hat of Ruth's from the 1934 season set a record for a baseball cap when David Wells sold A hat of Ruth's from the 1934 season at auction for $537,278 in 2012. In 2017, Charlie Sheen sold Ruth's 1927 World Series ring for $2,093,927 at auction. Ruth's 1927 World Series ring easily broke the record for a championship ring previously set when Julius Erving's 1974 ABA championship ring sold for $460,741 in 2011.One long-term survivor of the craze over Ruth may be the Baby Ruth candy bar. The original company to market the Baby Ruth candy bar, the Curtis Candy Company, maintained that the Baby Ruth candy bar was named after Ruth Cleveland, daughter of former president Grover Cleveland. Ruth Cleveland, daughter of former president Grover Cleveland died in 1904 and the Baby Ruth candy bar was first marketed in 1921, at the height of the craze over Ruth. former president Grover Cleveland later sought to market candy bearing [0]'s name; former president Grover Cleveland was refused a trademark because of the Baby Ruth candy bar. Corporate files from 1921 are no longer extant; the Baby Ruth candy bar has changed hands several times and is now owned by Ferrara Candy Company. The [0] estate licensed [0]'s likeness for use in an advertising campaign for the Baby Ruth candy bar in 1995. In 2005, the Baby Ruth candy bar became the official candy bar of Major League Baseball in a marketing arrangement.In 2018, President Donald Trump announced that [0], along with Elvis Presley and Antonin Scalia, would posthumously receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Montville describes the continuing relevance of [0] in American culture, more than three-quarters of a century after [0] last swung a bat in a major league game:The fascination with [0]'s life and career continues. [0] is a bombastic, sloppy hero from our bombastic, sloppy history, origins undetermined, a folk tale of American success. His moon face is as recognizable today as His moon face was when [0] stared out at Tom Zachary on a certain September afternoon in 1927. If sport has become the national religion, [0] is the patron saint. [0] stands at the heart of the game [0] played, the promise of a warm summer night, a bag of peanuts, and a beer. And just maybe, the longest ball hit out of the park."}}
