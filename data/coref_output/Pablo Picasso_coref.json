{"summary": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] (25 October 1881 \u2013 8 April 1973) was a Spanish painter, sculptor, printmaker, ceramicist and theatre designer who spent most of his adult life in France. One of the most influential artists of the 20th century, [0] is known for co-founding the Cubist movement, the invention of constructed sculpture, the co-invention of collage, and for the wide variety of styles that [0] helped develop and explore. Among [0]'s most famous works are the proto-Cubist Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907) and the anti-war painting Guernica (1937), a dramatic portrayal of the bombing of Guernica by German and Italian air forces during the Spanish Civil War.[0] demonstrated extraordinary artistic talent in [0]'s early years, painting in a naturalistic manner through [0]'s childhood and adolescence. During the first decade of the 20th century, [0]'s style changed as [0] experimented with different theories, techniques, and ideas. After 1906, the Fauvist work of the older artist Henri Matisse motivated [0] to explore more radical styles, beginning a fruitful rivalry between the two artists, who subsequently were often paired by critics as the leaders of modern art.[0]'s output, especially in [0]'s early career, is often periodized. While the names of many of [0]'s later periods are debated, the most commonly accepted periods in [0]'s work are the Blue Period (1901\u20131904), the Rose Period (1904\u20131906), the African-influenced Period (1907\u20131909), Analytic Cubism (1909\u20131912), and Synthetic Cubism (1912\u20131919), also referred to as the Crystal period. Much of [0]'s work of the late 1910s and early 1920s is in a neoclassical style, and [0]'s work in the mid-1920s often has characteristics of Surrealism. [0]'s later work often combines elements of [0]'s earlier styles.Exceptionally prolific throughout the course of his adult life, [0] achieved universal renown and immense fortune for [0]'s revolutionary artistic accomplishments, and became one of the best-known figures in 20th-century art."}, "Early life": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was born at 23:15 on 25 October 1881, in the city of M\u00e1laga, Andalusia, in southern Spain. [0] was the first child of Don Jos\u00e9 Ruiz y Blasco (1838\u20131913) and Mar\u00eda Picasso y L\u00f3pez. [0]'s family was of middle-class background. Don Jos\u00e9 Ruiz y Blasco (1838\u20131913) was a painter who specialized in naturalistic depictions of birds and other game. For most of Don Jos\u00e9 Ruiz y Blasco (1838\u20131913)'s life, Don Jos\u00e9 Ruiz y Blasco (1838\u20131913) was a professor of art at the School of Crafts and a curator of a local museum. Don Jos\u00e9 Ruiz y Blasco (1838\u20131913)'s ancestors were minor aristocrats.[citation [0]'s birth certificate and the record of [0]'s baptism include very long names, combining those of various saints and relatives. Ruiz y Picasso were [0]'s paternal and maternal surnames, respectively, per Spanish custom. The surname \"Picasso\" comes from Liguria, a coastal region of north-western Italy. [0]'s maternal great-grandfather, Tommaso Picasso, moved to Spain around [0] showed a passion and a skill for drawing from an early age. According to Mar\u00eda Picasso y L\u00f3pez, [0]'s first words were \"piz, piz\", a shortening of l\u00e1piz, the Spanish word for \"pencil\". From the age of seven, [0] received formal artistic training from Don Jos\u00e9 Ruiz y Blasco (1838\u20131913) in figure drawing and oil painting. Don Jos\u00e9 Ruiz y Blasco (1838\u20131913) was a traditional academic artist and instructor, who believed that proper training required disciplined copying of the masters, and drawing the human body from plaster casts and live models. Don Jos\u00e9 Ruiz y Blasco (1838\u20131913)'s became preoccupied with art to the detriment of [0]'s classwork.The family moved to A Coru\u00f1a in 1891, where Don Jos\u00e9 Ruiz y Blasco (1838\u20131913) became a professor at the School of Fine Arts. The family stayed almost four years. On one occasion, Don Jos\u00e9 Ruiz y Blasco (1838\u20131913) found Don Jos\u00e9 Ruiz y Blasco (1838\u20131913)'s painting over [0]'s unfinished sketch of a pigeon. Observing the precision of Don Jos\u00e9 Ruiz y Blasco (1838\u20131913)'s technique, an apocryphal story relates, Don Jos\u00e9 Ruiz y Blasco (1838\u20131913) felt that [0] had surpassed Don Jos\u00e9 Ruiz y Blasco (1838\u20131913), and vowed to give up painting, though paintings by [0] exist from later years.In 1895, [0] was traumatized when his seven-year-old sister, Conchita, died of diphtheria. After his seven-year-old sister, Conchita,'s , The family moved to Barcelona, where Don Jos\u00e9 Ruiz y Blasco (1838\u20131913) took a position at the School of Fine Arts's School of Fine Arts. [0] thrived in the city of M\u00e1laga, Andalusia, in southern Spain, regarding the city of M\u00e1laga, Andalusia, in southern Spain in times of sadness or nostalgia as [0]'s true home. Don Jos\u00e9 Ruiz y Blasco (1838\u20131913) persuaded the officials at the School of Fine Arts to allow Don Jos\u00e9 Ruiz y Blasco (1838\u20131913)'s to take an entrance exam for the advanced class. an entrance exam for the advanced class often took students a month, but [0] completed an entrance exam for the advanced class in a week, and the jury admitted [0], at just 13. As a student, [0] lacked discipline but made friendships that would affect [0] in later life. Don Jos\u00e9 Ruiz y Blasco (1838\u20131913) rented a small room for [0] close to home so [0] could work alone, yet Don Jos\u00e9 Ruiz y Blasco (1838\u20131913) checked up on [0] numerous times a day, judging [0]'s drawings. The two argued frequently.The two decided to send [0] to the city of M\u00e1laga, Andalusia, in southern Spain's Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando, the country's foremost art school. At age 16, [0] set off for the first time on [0]'s own, but [0] disliked formal instruction and stopped attending classes soon after enrollment. the city of M\u00e1laga, Andalusia, in southern Spain held many other attractions. The Prado housed paintings by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez, Francisco Goya, and Francisco Zurbar\u00e1n. [0] especially admired the works of El Greco; elements such as El Greco's elongated limbs, arresting colors, and mystical visages are echoed in [0]'s later work."}, "Career": {"Before 1900": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0]'s training under [0]'s father began before 1890. [0]'s progress can be traced in the collection of early works now held by the Museu Picasso in Barcelona, which provides one of the most comprehensive records extant of any major artist's beginnings. During 1893 the juvenile quality of [0]'s earliest work falls away, and by 1894 [0]'s career as a painter can be said to have begun. The academic realism apparent in the works of the mid-1890s is well displayed in The First Communion (1896), a large composition that depicts [0]'s sister, Lola. In the same year, at the age of 14, [0] painted Portrait of Aunt Pepa, a vigorous and dramatic portrait that Juan-Eduardo Cirlot has called \"without a doubt one of the greatest in the whole history of Spanish painting.\"In 1897, [0]'s realism began to show a Symbolist influence, for example, in a series of landscape paintings rendered in non-naturalistic violet and green tones. What some call his Modernist period (1899\u20131900) followed. [0]'s exposure to the work of Rossetti, Steinlen, Toulouse-Lautrec and Edvard Munch, combined with [0]'s admiration for favorite old masters such as El Greco, led [0] to a personal version of modernism in [0]'s works of his Modernist period (1899\u20131900).[0] made [0]'s first trip to Paris, then the art capital of Europe, in 1900. There, [0] met his first Parisian friend, journalist and poet Max Jacob, who helped Picasso learn the language and its literature. Soon they shared an apartment; his first Parisian friend, journalist and poet Max Jacob, who helped Picasso learn the language and its literature slept at night while [0] slept during the day and worked at night. These were times of severe poverty, cold, and desperation. Much of [0]'s work was burned to keep the small room warm. During the first five months of 1901, [0] lived in Madrid, where [0] and his anarchist friend Francisco de As\u00eds Soler founded the magazine Arte Joven (Young Art), which published five issues. his anarchist friend Francisco de As\u00eds Soler solicited articles and [0] illustrated the magazine Arte Joven (Young Art), which published five issues, mostly contributing grim cartoons depicting and sympathizing with the state of the poor. The first issue was published on 31 March 1901, by which time [0] had started to sign [0]'s work Picasso. From 1898 [0] signed [0]'s works as \"Pablo Ruiz Picasso\", then as \"Pablo R. Picasso\" until 1901. The change does not seem to imply a rejection of the father figure. Rather, [0] wanted to distinguish [0] from others; initiated by [0]'s Catalan friends who habitually called [0] by [0]'s maternal surname, much less current than the paternal Ruiz.", "Blue Period: 1901\u20131904": "[0] is our person to focus on. Picasso's Blue Period (1901\u20131904), characterized by somber paintings rendered in shades of blue and blue-green only occasionally warmed by other colors, began either in Spain in early 1901 or in Paris in the second half of the year. Many paintings of gaunt mothers with children date from Picasso's Blue Period (1901\u20131904), characterized by somber paintings rendered in shades of blue and blue-green only occasionally warmed by other colors,. In [0]'s austere use of color and sometimes doleful subject matter\u2014prostitutes and beggars are frequent subjects\u2014[0] was influenced by a trip through Spain and by the suicide of his friend Carles Casagemas. Starting in autumn of 1901, [0] painted several posthumous portraits of his friend Carles Casagemas culminating in the gloomy allegorical painting La Vie (1903), now in the Cleveland Museum of Art.The same mood pervades the well-known etching The Frugal Repast (1904), which depicts a blind man and a sighted woman, both emaciated, seated at a nearly bare table. Blindness, a recurrent theme in [0]'s works of Picasso's Blue Period (1901\u20131904), characterized by somber paintings rendered in shades of blue and blue-green only occasionally warmed by other colors,, is also represented in The Blindman's Meal (1903, the Metropolitan Museum of Art) and in the portrait of Celestina (1903). Other Picasso's Blue Period (1901\u20131904), characterized by somber paintings rendered in shades of blue and blue-green only occasionally warmed by other colors, works include Portrait of Soler and Portrait of Suzanne Bloch.", "Rose Period: 1904\u20131906": "[0] is our person to focus on. The Rose Period (1904\u20131906) is characterized by a lighter tone and style utilizing orange and pink colors and featuring many circus people, acrobats and harlequins known in France as saltimbanques. The harlequin, a comedic character usually depicted in checkered patterned clothing, became a personal symbol for [0]. [0] met Fernande Olivier, a bohemian artist who became his mistress, in Paris in 1904. Fernande Olivier, a bohemian artist who became his mistress, appears in many of The Rose Period (1904\u20131906) The Rose Period (1904\u20131906) paintings, many of which are influenced by [0]'s warm relationship with Fernande Olivier, a bohemian artist who became his mistress,, in addition to [0]'s increased exposure to French painting. The generally upbeat and optimistic mood of paintings in The Rose Period (1904\u20131906) is reminiscent of the 1899\u20131901 period (i.e., just prior to the Blue Period), and 1904 can be considered a transition year between the two periods.By 1904, [0] became a favorite of American art collectors Leo and Gertrude Stein. Their older brother Michael Stein and his wife Sarah also became collectors of [0]'s work. [0] painted a portrait of his wife Sarah and one of his wife Sarah's nephew Allan Stein. his wife Sarah became [0]'s principal patron, acquiring his drawings and paintings and exhibiting his drawings and paintings in his wife Sarah's informal Salon at his wife Sarah's home in Paris. At one of his wife Sarah's gatherings in 1904, [0] met Henri Matisse, who was to become a lifelong friend and rival. American art collectors Leo and Gertrude Stein introduced [0] to Claribel Cone and her sister Etta, who were American art collectors; Claribel Cone and her sister Etta, who were American art collectors also began to acquire [0]'s and Henri Matisse, who was to become a lifelong friend and rival's paintings. Eventually Leo moved to Italy. Their older brother Michael Stein and his wife Sarah became patrons of Henri Matisse, who was to become a lifelong friend and rival, while his wife Sarah continued to collect Picassos.In 1907, [0] joined an art gallery that had recently been opened in Paris by Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, a German art historian and art collector who became one of the premier French art dealers of the 20th century. Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, a German art historian and art collector who became one of the premier French art dealers of the 20th century was among the first champions of Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque and the Cubism that they jointly developedPablo Picasso, Georges Braque and the Cubism that they jointly developed . Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, a German art historian and art collector who became one of the premier French art dealers of the 20th century promoted burgeoning artists such as Andr\u00e9 Derain, Kees van Dongen, Fernand L\u00e9ger, Juan Gris, Maurice de Vlaminck and several others who had come from all over the globe to live and work in Montparnasse at the time.", "African art and primitivism: 1907\u20131909": "[0] is our person to focus on. Picasso's African-influenced Period (1907\u20131909) begins with his painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon. The three figures on the left were inspired by Iberian sculpture, but [0] repainted the faces of the two figures on the right after being powerfully impressed by African artefacts [0] saw in June 1907 in the ethnographic museum at Palais du Trocad\u00e9ro. When [0] displayed his painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon to acquaintances in [0]'s studio later that year, the nearly universal reaction was shock and revulsion; Matisse angrily dismissed his painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon as a hoax. [0] did not exhibit his painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon publicly until 1916.Other works from Picasso's African-influenced Period (1907\u20131909) include Nude with Raised Arms (1907) and Three Women (1908). Formal ideas developed during Picasso's African-influenced Period (1907\u20131909) lead directly into the Cubist period that follows.Analytic cubism (1909\u20131912) is a style of painting [0] developed with Georges Braque using monochrome brownish and neutral colors. Both artists took apart objects and \"analyzed\" objects in terms of objects's shapes. Both artists's Georges Braque's paintings at Analytic cubism (1909\u20131912) share many similarities.In Paris, [0] entertained a distinguished coterie of friends in the Montmartre and Montparnasse quarters, including Andr\u00e9 Breton, poet Guillaume Apollinaire, writer Alfred Jarry and Gertrude Stein. In 1911, [0] was arrested and questioned about the theft of the Mona Lisa from the Louvre. Suspicion for the theft of the Mona Lisa had initially fallen upon poet Guillaume Apollinaire due to poet Guillaume Apollinaire's links to G\u00e9ry Pieret, an artist with a history of thefts from the Louvre. poet Guillaume Apollinaire in turn implicated poet Guillaume Apollinaire's poet Guillaume Apollinaire . Afraid of a conviction that could result in [0]'s deportation to Spain, [0] denied having ever met poet Guillaume Apollinaire. Both artists were later cleared of any involvement in the Mona Lisa's disappearance.", "Synthetic cubism: 1912\u20131919": "[0] is our person to focus on. Synthetic cubism (1912\u20131919) was a further development of the genre of cubism, in which cut paper fragments\u00a0\u2013 often wallpaper or portions of newspaper pages\u00a0\u2013 were pasted into compositions, marking the first use of collage in fine art.[citation needed]Between 1915 and 1917, [0] began a series of paintings depicting highly geometric and minimalist Cubist objects, consisting of either a pipe, a guitar or a glass, with an occasional element of collage. \"Hard-edged square-cut diamonds\", notes art historian John Richardson, \"highly geometric and minimalist Cubist objects, consisting of either a pipe, a guitar or a glass do not always have upside or downside\". \"We need a new name to designate highly geometric and minimalist Cubist objects, consisting of either a pipe, a guitar or a glass,\" wrote [0] to Gertrude Stein. The term \"Crystal Cubism\" was later used as a result of visual analogies with crystals at the time. highly geometric and minimalist Cubist objects, consisting of either a pipe, a guitar or a glass may have been produced by [0] in response to critics who had claimed [0]'s defection from the movement, through [0]'s experimentation with classicism within the so-called return to order following the war.After acquiring some fame and fortune, [0] left Olivier for Marcelle Humbert, also known as Eva Gouel. [0] included declarations of [0]'s love for Marcelle Humbert, also known as Eva Gouel in many Cubist works. [0] was devastated by Marcelle Humbert, also known as Eva Gouel's premature death from illness at the age of 30 in 1915.At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, [0] was living in Avignon. Braque and Derain were mobilized and Apollinaire joined the French artillery, while the Spaniard Juan Gris remained from the Cubist circle. During World War I, [0] was able to continue painting uninterrupted, unlike [0]'s French comrades. [0]'s paintings became more sombre and [0]'s life changed with dramatic consequences. Kahnweiler's's contract had terminated on Kahnweiler's's exile from France. At this point [0]'s work would be taken on by the art dealer L\u00e9once Rosenberg. After the loss of Marcelle Humbert, also known as Eva Gouel, [0] had an affair with Gaby Lespinasse. During the spring of 1916, Apollinaire returned from the front wounded. They renewed They's friendship, but [0] began to frequent new social circles.Towards the end of World War I, [0] became involved with Serge Diaghilev's's Ballets Russes. Among [0]'s friends during this period were Jean Cocteau, Jean Hugo, Juan Gris, and others. In the summer of 1918, [0] married Olga Khokhlova, a ballerina with Sergei Diaghilev's troupe, for whom Picasso was designing a ballet, Erik Satie's Parade, in Rome; they spent they's honeymoon near Biarritz in the villa of glamorous Chilean art patron Eugenia Err\u00e1zuriz.After returning from [0]'s honeymoon and in need of money, [0] started [0]'s exclusive relationship with the art dealer L\u00e9once Rosenberg. As part of the art dealer L\u00e9once Rosenberg's first duties, the art dealer L\u00e9once Rosenberg agreed to rent they an apartment in Paris at the art dealer L\u00e9once Rosenberg's own expense, which was located next to the art dealer L\u00e9once Rosenberg's own house. This was the start of a deep brother-like friendship between two very different men, that would last until the outbreak of World War II.[citation Olga Khokhlova, a ballerina with Sergei Diaghilev's troupe, for whom Picasso was designing a ballet, Erik Satie's Parade, in Rome introduced [0] to high society, formal dinner parties, and other dimensions of the life of the rich in Paris. they had a son, Paulo Picasso, who would grow up to be a motorcycle racer and chauffeur to his fathera son, Paulo Picasso, who would grow up to be a motorcycle racer and chauffeur to his father's . Olga Khokhlova, a ballerina with Sergei Diaghilev's troupe, for whom Picasso was designing a ballet, Erik Satie's Parade, in Rome's insistence on social propriety clashed with [0]'s bohemian tendencies and they lived in a state of constant conflict. During the same period that [0] collaborated with Serge Diaghilev's's troupe, [0] and Igor Stravinsky collaborated on Pulcinella in 1920. [0] took the opportunity to make several drawings of Igor Stravinsky.In 1927, [0] met 17-year-old Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Walter and began a secret affair with 17-year-old Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Walter. [0]'s Olga Khokhlova, a ballerina with Sergei Diaghilev's troupe, for whom Picasso was designing a ballet, Erik Satie's Parade, in Rome soon ended in separation rather than divorce, as French law required an even division of property in the case of divorce, and [0] did not want Olga Khokhlova, a ballerina with Sergei Diaghilev's troupe, for whom Picasso was designing a ballet, Erik Satie's Parade, in Rome to have half [0]'s wealth. they remained legally married until Olga Khokhlova, a ballerina with Sergei Diaghilev's troupe, for whom Picasso was designing a ballet, Erik Satie's Parade, in Rome's death in 1955. [0] carried on a long-standing affair with 17-year-old Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Walter and fathered a daughter with 17-year-old Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Walter, named Maya. 17-year-old Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Walter lived in the vain hope that [0] would one day marry 17-year-old Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Walter, and hanged 17-year-old Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Walter four years after [0]'s death.1909, Femme assise (Sitzende Frau), oil on canvas, 100 \u00d7 80\u00a0cm (39 \u00d7 31 in), Staatliche Museen, Neue Nationalgalerie, Berlin1909\u201310, Figure dans un Fauteuil (Seated Nude, Femme nue assise), oil on canvas, 92.1 \u00d7 73\u00a0cm (36 \u00d7 28 in), Tate Modern, London.

In February 1917, [0] made [0]'s first trip to Italy. In the period following the upheaval of World War I, [0] produced work in a neoclassical style. This \"return to order\" is evident in the work of many European artists in the 1920s, including Andr\u00e9 Derain, Giorgio de Chirico, Gino Severini, Jean Metzinger, the artists of the New Objectivity movement and of the Novecento Italiano movement. [0]'s paintings and drawings from the 1920s frequently recall the work of Raphael and Ingres.In 1925 the Surrealist writer and poet Andr\u00e9 Breton declared [0] as 'one of ours' in the Surrealist writer and poet Andr\u00e9 Breton's article Le Surr\u00e9alisme et la peinture, published in R\u00e9volution surr\u00e9aliste. Les Demoiselles was reproduced for the first time in Europe in the same issue. Yet [0] exhibited Cubist works at the first Surrealist group exhibition in 1925; the concept of 'psychic automatism in its pure state' defined in the Manifeste du surr\u00e9alisme never appealed to [0] entirely. [0] did at the time develop new imagery and formal syntax for expressing [0] emotionally, \"releasing the violence, the psychic fears and the eroticism that had been largely contained or sublimated since 1909\", writes art historian Melissa McQuillan. Although this transition in [0]'s work was informed by Cubism for Cubism's spatial relations, \"the fusion of ritual and abandon in the imagery recalls the primitivism of Les Demoiselles and the elusive psychological resonances of [0]'s Symbolist work\", writes art historian Melissa McQuillan.

During the 1930s, the minotaur replaced the harlequin as a common motif in [0]'s work. [0]'s use of the minotaur came partly from [0]'s contact with the surrealists, who often used it as their symbolthe surrealists, who often used it as their symbol's , and the minotaur appears in Picasso's Guernica. the minotaur and [0]'s mistress Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Walter are heavily featured in [0]'s celebrated Vollard Suite of etchings.Arguably [0]'s most famous work is Picasso's Guernica. Picasso's Guernica embodies for many the inhumanity, brutality and hopelessness of war. Asked to explain Picasso's Guernica's symbolism, [0] said, \"It isn't up to [0] to define the symbols. Otherwise it would be better if [0] wrote the symbols out in so many words! The public who look at the picture must interpret the symbols as The public who look at the picture understand the symbols.\" Picasso's Guernica was exhibited in July 1937 at the Spanish Pavilion at the Paris International Exposition, and then became the centerpiece of an exhibition of 118 works by [0], Matisse, Braque and Henri Laurens that toured Scandinavia and England. After the victory of Francisco Franco in Spain, Picasso's Guernica was sent to the United States to raise funds and support for Spanish refugees. Until 1981 Picasso's Guernica was entrusted to the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City, as it was [0]'s expressed desire that Picasso's Guernica should not be delivered to Spain until liberty and democracy had been established in Spain.In 1939 and 1940, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City, under the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City's director Alfred Barr, a [0] enthusiast, held a major retrospective of Picasso's principal works until that time. a major retrospective of Picasso's principal works until that time lionized [0], brought into full public view in the United States the scope of [0]'s artistry, and resulted in a reinterpretation of [0]'s work by contemporary art historians and scholars. According to Jonathan Weinberg, \"Given the extraordinary quality of a major retrospective of Picasso's principal works until that time and [0]'s enormous prestige, generally heightened by the political impact of Picasso's Guernica ... the critics were surprisingly ambivalent\". [0]'s \"multiplicity of styles\" was disturbing to one journalist; another described [0] as \"wayward and even malicious\"; Alfred Frankenstein's review in ARTnews concluded that [0] was both charlatan and genius.", "World War II and late 1940s: 1939\u20131949": "[0] is our person to focus on. During World War II, [0] remained in Paris while the Germans occupied Paris. [0]'s artistic style did not fit the Nazi ideal of art, so [0] did not exhibit during World War II. [0] was often harassed by the Gestapo. During one search of [0]'s apartment, an officer saw a photograph of the painting Guernica. \"Did [0] do a photograph of the painting Guernica?\" an officer asked [0]. \"No,\" [0] replied, \"an officer did.\"Retreating to [0]'s studio, [0] continued to paint, producing works such as the Still Life with Guitar (1942) and The Charnel House (1944\u201348). Although the Germans outlawed bronze casting in Paris, [0] continued regardless, using bronze smuggled to [0] by the French Resistance.Around this time, [0] wrote poetry as an alternative outlet. Between 1935 and 1959 [0] wrote over 300 poems. Largely untitled except for a date and sometimes the location of where it was written (for example \"Paris 16 May 1936\"), over 300 poems were gustatory, erotic, and at times scatological, as were [0]'s two full-length plays, Desire Caught by the Tail (1941), and The Four Little Girls (1949).In 1944, after the liberation of Paris, [0] began a romantic relationship with a young art student named Fran\u00e7oise Gilot. a young art student named Fran\u00e7oise Gilot was 40 years younger than [0] was. [0] grew tired of [0]'s mistress Dora Maar; Picasso and Gilot a young art student named Fran\u00e7oise Gilot began to live together. Eventually Picasso and Gilot had two children: Claude Picasso, born in 1947 and Paloma Picasso, born in 1949. In a young art student named Fran\u00e7oise Gilot's 1964 book Life with [0], a young art student named Fran\u00e7oise Gilot describes [0]'s abusive treatment and myriad infidelities which led a young art student named Fran\u00e7oise Gilot to leave [0], taking two children: Claude Picasso, born in 1947 and Paloma Picasso, born in 1949 with a young art student named Fran\u00e7oise Gilot. leave was a severe blow to Picasso.[citation [0] had affairs with women of an even greater age disparity than Picasso and Gilot's. While still involved with a young art student named Fran\u00e7oise Gilot, in 1951 [0] had a six-week affair with Genevi\u00e8ve Laporte, who was four years younger than a young art student named Fran\u00e7oise Gilot. By [0]'s 70s, many paintings, ink drawings and prints have as many paintings, ink drawings and prints's theme an old, grotesque dwarf as the doting lover of a beautiful young model. a beautiful young model worked at the Madoura Pottery in Vallauris on the French Riviera, where [0] made and painted ceramics. a beautiful young model became [0]'s lover, and then [0]'s second wife in 1961. Picasso and Gilot were together for the remainder of [0]'s life.[0]'s marriage to a beautiful young model was also a means of revenge against a young art student named Fran\u00e7oise Gilot; with [0]'s encouragement, a young art student named Fran\u00e7oise Gilot had divorced a young art student named Fran\u00e7oise Gilot then husband, Luc Simon, with the plan to marry [0] to secure the rights of a young art student named Fran\u00e7oise Gilot's children as [0]'s legitimate heirs. [0] had already secretly married a beautiful young model, after a young art student named Fran\u00e7oise Gilot had filed for divorce. [0]'s strained relationship with Claude and Paloma was never healed.By this time, [0] had constructed a huge Gothic home, and could afford large villas in the south of France, such as Mas Notre-Dame-de-Vie on the outskirts of Mougins, and in the Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur.

In the 1950s, [0]'s style changed once again, as [0] took to producing reinterpretations of the art of the great masters. [0] made a series of works based on Vel\u00e1zquez's painting of Las Meninas. [0] also based paintings on works by Goya, Poussin, Manet, Courbet and Delacroix.[citation needed]In addition to [0]'s artistic accomplishments, [0] made a few film appearances, always as [0], including a cameo in Jean Cocteau's Testament of Orpheus (1960).

[0] approached the project with a great deal of enthusiasm, designing a huge 50-foot (15\u00a0m)-high public sculpture to be built in Chicago, known usually as the Chicago Picasso. [0] said the figure represented the head of an Afghan Hound named Kabul. a huge 50-foot (15\u00a0m)-high public sculpture to be built in Chicago, known usually as the Chicago Picasso, was unveiled in 1967. [0] refused to be paid $100,000 for a huge 50-foot (15\u00a0m)-high public sculpture to be built in Chicago, known usually as the Chicago Picasso, donating a huge 50-foot (15\u00a0m)-high public sculpture to be built in Chicago, known usually as the Chicago Picasso to the people of the city.[citation needed]Picasso's final works were a mixture of styles, [0]'s means of expression in constant flux until the end of [0]'s life. Devoting [0]'s full energies to [0]'s work, [0] became more daring, [0]'s works more colourful and expressive, and from 1968 to 1971 [0] produced a torrent of paintings and hundreds of copperplate etchings. At the time a torrent of paintings and hundreds of copperplate etchings were dismissed by most as pornographic fantasies of an impotent old man or the slapdash works of an artist who was past his primean artist who was past his prime's .

[0] remained aloof from the Catalan independence movement during [0]'s youth, despite expressing general support and being friendly with activists within the Catalan independence movement. [0] did not join the armed forces for any side or country during World War I, the Spanish Civil War, or World War II. As a Spanish citizen living in France, [0] was under no compulsion to fight against the invading Germans in either world war. In 1940, [0] applied for French citizenship, but French citizenship was refused on the grounds of [0]'s \"extremist ideas evolving towards communism\". This information was not revealed until 2003.At the start of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, [0] was 54 years of age. Soon after hostilities began, the Republicans appointed [0] \"director of the Prado, albeit in absentia\", and \"[0] took [0]'s duties very seriously\", according to John Richardson, supplying the funds to evacuate the Prado's collection to Geneva. the Spanish Civil War provided the impetus for [0]'s first overtly political work. [0] expressed anger and condemnation of Francisco Franco and fascists in The Dream and Lie of Franco (1937), which was produced \"specifically for propagandistic and fundraising purposes\". This surreal fusion of words and images was intended to be sold as a series of postcards to raise funds for the Spanish Republican cause.In 1944, [0] joined the French Communist Party. [0] attended the 1948 World Congress of Intellectuals in Defense of Peace in Poland, and in 1950 received the Stalin Peace Prize from the Soviet government. A portrait of Joseph Stalin made by [0] in 1953 drew Party criticism due to being insufficiently realistic, though [0] remained a loyal member of the French Communist Party until [0]'s death. [0]'s dealer, D-H. Kahnweiler, a socialist, termed [0]'s communism \"sentimental\" rather than political, saying \"[0] has never read a line of Karl Marx, nor of Engels of course.\" In a 1945 interview with Jerome Seckler, [0] stated: \"[0] am a Communist and [0]'s painting is Communist painting. ... But if [0] were a shoemaker, Royalist or Communist or anything else, [0] would not necessarily hammer [0]'s shoes in a special way to show [0]'s politics.\" [0]'s commitment to communism, common among continental intellectuals and artists at the time, has long been the subject of some controversy; a notable demonstration thereof was a quote by Salvador Dal\u00ed (with whom Picasso had a rather strained relationship):Picasso es pintor, yo tambi\u00e9n; ... [0] es espa\u00f1ol, yo tambi\u00e9n; [0] es comunista, yo tampoco.(Picasso is a painter, so am Salvador Dal\u00ed (with whom Picasso had a rather strained relationship):Picasso es pintor, yo tambi\u00e9n; ...

The art critic Kirsten Hoving Keen wrote that depicted was \"inspired by reports of American atrocities\" and considered depicted one of [0]'s communist works.On 9 January 1949, [0] created Dove, a black and white lithograph. Dove, a black and white lithograph was used to illustrate a poster at the 1949 World Peace Council and became an iconographic image of the period, known as \"The dove of peace\". [0]'s image was used around the world as a symbol of the Peace Congresses and communism.In 1962, [0] received the Stalin Peace Prize. Biographer and art critic John Berger felt [0]'s talents as an artist were \"wasted\" by the French Communist Party. According to Jean Cocteau's's diaries, [0] once said to Jean Cocteau's in reference to the French Communist Party: \"[0] have joined a family, and like all families, a family's full of shit.\""}, "Style and technique": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was exceptionally prolific throughout [0]'s long lifetime. At [0]'s death there were more than 45,000 unsold works in [0]'s estate, comprising 1,885 paintings, 1,228 sculptures, 3,222 ceramics, 7,089 drawings, 150 sketchbooks, many thousands of prints, and numerous tapestries and rugs. The most complete \u2013 but not exhaustive \u2013 catalogue of [0]'s works, the catalogue raisonn\u00e9 compiled by Christian Zervos, lists more than 16,000 paintings and drawings. [0]'s output was several times more prolific than most artists of [0]'s era; by at least one account, American artist Bob Ross is the only one to rival [0]'s volume, and American artist Bob Ross's artwork was designed specifically to be easily mass-produced quickly.The medium in which [0] made [0]'s most important contribution was painting. In [0]'s paintings, [0] used colour as an expressive element, but relied on drawing rather than subtleties of colour to create form and space. [0] sometimes added sand to his paint to vary his paint's texture. A nanoprobe of [0]'s The Red Armchair (1931), in the collection of the Art Institute of Chicago, by physicists at Argonne National Laboratory in 2012 confirmed art historians' belief that [0] used common house paint in many of [0]'s paintings. Much of [0]'s painting was done at night by artificial light.[0]'s early sculptures were carved from wood or modelled in wax or clay, but from 1909 to 1928 [0] abandoned modelling and instead made sculptural constructions using diverse materials. An example is Guitar (1912), a relief construction made of sheet metal and wire that Jane Fluegel terms a \"three-dimensional planar counterpart of Cubist painting\" that marks a \"revolutionary departure from the traditional approaches, modeling and carving\".From the beginning of [0]'s career, [0] displayed an interest in subject matter of every kind, and demonstrated a great stylistic versatility that enabled [0] to work in several styles at once. For example, [0]'s paintings of 1917 included the pointillist Woman with a Mantilla, the Cubist Figure in an Armchair, and the naturalistic Harlequin (all in the Museu Picasso, Barcelona). In 1919, [0] made a number of drawings from postcards and photographs that reflect [0]'s interest in the stylistic conventions and static character of posed photographs. In 1921 [0] simultaneously painted several large neoclassical paintings and two versions of the Cubist composition Three Musicians (Museum of Modern Art, New York; Philadelphia Museum of Art). In an interview published in 1923, [0] said, \"The several manners [0] have used in [0]'s art must not be considered as an evolution, or as steps towards an unknown ideal of painting ... If the subjects [0] have wanted to express have suggested different ways of expression [0] have never hesitated to adopt different ways of expression.\"Although his Cubist works approach abstraction, [0] never relinquished the objects of the real world as subject matter. Prominent in his Cubist works are forms easily recognized as guitars, violins, and bottles. When [0] depicted complex narrative scenes depicted was usually in prints, drawings, and small-scale works; Guernica (1937) is one of [0]'s few large narrative paintings.[0] painted mostly from imagination or memory. According to William Rubin, [0] \"could only make great art from subjects that truly involved [0] ... Unlike Matisse, [0] had eschewed models virtually all [0]'s mature life, preferring to paint individuals whose lives had both impinged on, and had real significance for, [0]'s own.\" The art critic Arthur Danto said his Cubist works constitutes a \"vast pictorial autobiography\" that provides some basis for the popular conception that \"[0] invented a new style each time [0] fell in love with a new woman\". The autobiographical nature of [0]'s art is reinforced by [0]'s habit of dating [0]'s works, often to the day. [0] explained: \"[0] want to leave to posterity a documentation that will be as complete as possible. want's why [0] put a date on everything [0] do.\""}, "Artistic legacy": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0]'s influence was and remains immense and widely acknowledged by [0]'s admirers and detractors alike. On the occasion of [0]'s 1939 retrospective at MoMA, Life magazine wrote: \"During the 25 years [0] has dominated modern European art, [0]'s enemies say [0] has been a corrupting influence. With equal violence, [0]'s friends say [0] is the greatest artist alive.\" [0] was the first artist to receive a special honour exhibition at the Grand Gallery of the Louvre Museum in Paris in celebration of [0]'s 90 years. In 1998, Robert Hughes wrote of [0]: \"To say that [0] dominated Western art in the 20th century is, by now, the merest commonplace. ... No painter or sculptor, not even Michelangelo, had been as famous as [0] in [0]'s own lifetime. ... Though Marcel Duchamp, that cunning old fox of conceptual irony, has certainly had more influence on nominally vanguard art over the past 30 years than [0], the Spaniard was the last great beneficiary of the belief that the language of painting and sculpture really mattered to people other than their devotees.\"At the time of [0]'s death many of [0]'s paintings were in [0]'s possession, as [0] had kept off the art market what [0] did not need to sell. In addition, [0] had a considerable collection of the work of other famous artists, some [0]'s contemporaries, such as Henri Matisse, with whom [0] had exchanged works. Since [0] left no will, [0]'s death duties (estate tax) to the French state were paid in the form of his works and others from [0]'s collection. his works form the core of the immense and representative collection of the Mus\u00e9e Picasso in Paris.

In A Moveable Feast by Ernest Hemingway, Ernest Hemingway tells Gertrude Stein that Ernest Hemingway would like to have some Picassos, but cannot afford some Picassos. Later in A Moveable Feast by Ernest Hemingway, Ernest Hemingway mentions looking at one of Picasso's paintings.

In the 1940s, a Swiss insurance company based in Basel had bought two paintings by Picasso to diversify a Swiss insurance company based in Basel's investments and serve as a guarantee for the insured risks. Following an air disaster in 1967, a Swiss insurance company based in Basel had to pay out heavy reimbursements. a Swiss insurance company based in Basel decided to part with two paintings by Picasso. In 1968, a large number of Basel citizens called for a local referendum on the purchase of two paintings by Picasso by the Canton of Basel-Stadt, which was successful, making it the first time in democratic history that the population of a city voted on the purchase of works of art for a public art museum. two paintings by Picasso therefore remained in the Kunstmuseum Basel.

Many of these women The women in Picasso's life functioned as muses for [0], and Many of these women's inclusion in [0]'s extensive oeuvre granted Many of these women a place in art history.
