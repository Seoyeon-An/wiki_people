For nearly 10 years, The Koch brothers advocated for several reforms within the criminal justice system which include reducing recidivism rates, simplifying the employment process for the rehabilitated, and defending private property from government seizures through asset forfeiture. Allying with groups such as the ACLU, the Center for American Progress, Families Against Mandatory Minimums, the Coalition for Public Safety, and the MacArthur Foundation, The Koch brothers maintained that current prison system unfairly targeted low-income and minority communities at the expense of the public budget.The Koch brothers's advocacy has also attracted scrutiny and criticism. Michelle Chen, writing in America, and William C. Anderson, writing in The Guardian, caution that their bipartisan efforts to reform the prison system in the United States reflect broader interests in further privatizing the criminal justice system. In 2015, The Guardian reported that their bipartisan efforts to reform the prison system in the United States exist alongside continued funding of \"tough-on-crime\" political candidates and committees pushing for harsher sentencing. Writing in Political Research Associates, Kay Whitlock argues that The Koch brothers's avid support for measures such as  mens rea or \"criminal intent\" reform exemplify \"an agenda of deregulation and relief for 'overcriminalized' corporations and executives\" rather than concern for individual rights of the accused.", "": ""}, "Philanthropy": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on.
