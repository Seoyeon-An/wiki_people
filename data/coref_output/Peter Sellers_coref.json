The family constantly toured, causing much upheaval and unhappiness in [0]'s life.[0] maintained a very close relationship with Agnes Doreen \"Peg\" (n\u00e9e Marks), which his friend Spike Milligan later considered unhealthy for a grown man. Sellers's agent, Dennis Selinger, recalled Sellers's agent, Dennis Selinger,'s first meeting with His parents, noting that \"[0] was an immensely shy young man, inclined to be dominated by Agnes Doreen \"Peg\" (n\u00e9e Marks), but without resentment or objection\". As an only child though, [0] spent much time alone.In 1935 The family moved to North London and settled in Muswell Hill. Although Yorkshire-born William \"Bill\" Sellers was Protestant and Agnes Doreen \"Peg\" (n\u00e9e Marks) was Jewish, [0] attended the nearby  Roman Catholic school St Aloysius' College in Highgate, run by the Brothers of Our Lady of Mercy. The family was not rich, but Agnes Doreen \"Peg\" (n\u00e9e Marks) insisted on an expensive private schooling for Agnes Doreen \"Peg\" (n\u00e9e Marks)'s . According to biographer Peter Evans, [0] was fascinated, puzzled, and worried by religion from a young age, particularly Catholicism; Roger Lewis believed that soon after entering Catholic school, [0] \"discovered [0] was a Jew\u2014[0] was someone on the outside of the mysteries of faith\". Later in [0]'s life, [0] observed that while Yorkshire-born William \"Bill\" Sellers's faith was according to the Church of England, Agnes Doreen \"Peg\" (n\u00e9e Marks) was Jewish, \"and Jews take the faith of Jews's mother.\" According to his friend Spike Milligan, [0] held a guilt complex about being Jewish and recalls that [0] was once reduced to tears when [0] presented his friend Spike Milligan with a candlestick from a synagogue for Christmas, believing the gesture to be an anti-Jewish slur.

[0] recalled that a teacher scolded the other boys for not studying, saying: \"[0] knows [0]'s catechism better than the rest of you!\"Accompanying The family on the variety show circuit, [0] learned stagecraft, but received conflicting encouragement from His parents and developed mixed feelings about show business. Yorkshire-born William \"Bill\" Sellers doubted [0]'s abilities in the entertainment field, even suggesting that Yorkshire-born William \"Bill\" Sellers's talents were only enough to become a road sweeper, while Agnes Doreen \"Peg\" (n\u00e9e Marks) encouraged [0] continuously.While at St Aloysius College, [0] began to develop [0]'s improvisational skills. He and his closest friend at the time, Bryan Connon, He and his closest friend at the time, Bryan Connon, enjoyed listening to early radio comedy shows. his closest friend at the time, Bryan Connon remembers that \"[0] got endless pleasure imitating the people in Monday Night at Eight.

With the outbreak of the Second World War, St. Aloysius College was evacuated to Cambridgeshire. Because his mother did not allow [0] to go, [0]'s formal education ended at fourteen. Early in 1940, the family moved to the north Devon town of Ilfracombe, where [0]'s maternal uncle managed the Victoria Palace Theatre; [0] got [0]'s first job at the Victoria Palace Theatre, aged fifteen, starting as a caretaker.

Joe Daniels noticed [0]'s efforts and gave [0] practical instructions. The instrument greatly suited [0]'s temperament and artistic skills. Spike Milligan later noted that [0] was very proficient on the drums and might have remained a jazz drummer, had [0] lacked [0]'s skills in mimicry and improvisation. As the Second World War progressed, [0] continued to develop [0]'s drumming skills, and played with a series of touring bands, including those of Oscar Rabin, Henry Hall and Waldini, as well as [0]'s father's quartet, before [0] left and joined a band from Blackpool.

BBC radio producer Roy Speer called [0] a \"cheeky young sod\" for [0]'s efforts, but gave [0] an audition.

Alec Guinness, who is an absolute idol of mine is [0]'s ideal... and [0]'s idol.\"\u2014Sellers on studying Alec Guinness, who is an absolute idol of mine during filming The Ladykillers.[0] pursued a film career and took a number of small roles such as a police officer in John and Julie (1955).

Sophia Loren's a lot different from Harry Secombe.\" Sellers and Loren developed a close relationship during filming, culminating in [0] declaring [0]'s love for Sophia Loren in front of [0]'s wife. [0] also woke his son at night to ask: \"Do his son think [0] should divorce his son's mummy?\" There is uncertainty if a close relationship was anything more than platonic: a number of people, including Spike Milligan, consider a close relationship an affair, while others, including Graham Stark, think a close relationship remained only a strong friendship. Sellers's wife at the time, Anne, afterwards commented, \"Sellers's wife at the time, Anne, don't know to this day whether [0] had an affair with Sophia Loren.

Stanley Kubrick encouraged [0] to improvise and stated that [0] often reached a \"state of comic ecstasy\". Stanley Kubrick had American jazz producer Norman Granz record portions of the script for [0] to listen to, so [0] could study the voice and develop confidence, granting [0] a free artistic licence. [0] later claimed that [0]'s relationship with Stanley Kubrick became one of the most rewarding of [0]'s career. Writing in The Sunday Times, Dilys Powell commented that [0] gave \"a firework performance, funny, malicious, only once for a few seconds overreaching itself, and in the murder scene which is both prologue and epilogue achieving the macabre in comedy\".

[0] think a forgivable vanity would humanize Clouseau and make Clouseau kind of touching. It's as if filmgoers are kept one fall ahead of Clouseau.[0] on portraying Clouseau.After [0]'s father's death in October 1962, [0] decided to leave England and was approached by director Blake Edwards who offered him the role of Inspector Clouseau in The Pink Panther, after Peter Ustinov had backed out of Mr. Topaze, in which he also starred. director Blake Edwards who offered him the role of Inspector Clouseau in The Pink Panther later recalled director Blake Edwards who offered him the role of Inspector Clouseau in The Pink Panther's feelings as \"desperately unhappy and ready to kill, but as fate would have it, director Blake Edwards who offered him the role of Inspector Clouseau in The Pink Panther got [0] instead of Peter Ustinov\u2014thank God!\" [0] accepted a fee of \u00a390,000 (\u00a3860,300 in 2022 pounds) for five weeks' work on location in Rome and Cortina.

Stanley Kubrick asked [0] to play four roles: US President Merkin Muffley, Dr. Strangelove, US Air Force Major T. J. \"King\" Kong, and Group Captain Lionel Mandrake of the RAF. [0] was initially hesitant about taking on four roles: US President Merkin Muffley, Dr. Strangelove, US Air Force Major T. J. \"King\" Kong, and Group Captain Lionel Mandrake of the RAF, but Stanley Kubrick prevailed. According to some accounts, [0] was also invited to play the part of General Buck Turgidson, but turned play down because play was too physically demanding. Stanley Kubrick later commented that the idea of having [0] in so many of Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb's key roles was that \"everywhere you turn there is some version of [0] holding the fate of the world in [0]'s hands\". [0] was especially anxious about successfully enacting the role of US Air Force Major T. J. \"King\" Kong and accurately affecting a Texan accent. Stanley Kubrick requested screenwriter Terry Southern to record in [0]'s natural accent a tape of Kong's linesUS Air Force Major T. J. \"King\" Kong's . After practising with a tape of Kong's lines, [0] got sufficient control of a Texan accent, and started shooting the scenes in the aeroplane.After the first day's shooting, [0] sprained [0]'s ankle while leaving a restaurant and could no longer work in the cramped cockpit set. Stanley Kubrick then re-cast Slim Pickens as US Air Force Major T. J. \"King\" Kong. The three roles Sellers undertook were distinct, \"variegated, complex and refined\", and critic Alexander Walker considered that The three roles Sellers undertook \"showed [0]'s genius at full stretch\". [0] played US President Merkin Muffley as a bland, placid intellectual in the mould of Adlai Stevenson; [0] played Group Captain Lionel Mandrake of the RAF as an unflappable Englishman; and Dr. Strangelove as a wheelchair-using fanatic. The critic for The Times wrote that Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb includes, \"three remarkable performances from [0], diverting as a revue-sketch ex-Nazi US Scientist\u00a0... and acceptable as an RAF officer,\" although The critic for The Times The critic for The Times thought [0]'s portrayal of an RAF officer was, \"worth the price of an admission ticket\". For [0]'s performance in The three roles Sellers undertook, [0] was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor at the 37th Academy Awards, and the Best British Actor award at the 18th British Academy Film Awards.Between November 1963 and February 1964, [0] began filming A Shot in the Dark, an adaptation of a French play, L'Idiote by Marcel Achard. [0] found the part and the director, Anatole Litvak, uninspiring; the producers brought in Blake Edwards to replace the director, Anatole Litvak,. Together with writer William Peter Blatty, they turned the script into a Clouseau comedy, also adding Herbert Lom as Commissioner Dreyfus and Burt Kwouk as Cato. During filming, [0]'s relationship with Blake Edwards became strained; Sellers and Kubrick would often stop speaking to Sellers and Kubrick during filming, communicating only by the passing of notes. [0]'s personality was described by others as difficult and demanding, and [0] often clashed with fellow actors and directors. Upon Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb's release in late June 1964, Bosley Crowther noted the \"joyously free and facile way\" in which [0] had developed [0]'s comedy technique.[0] feel extremely vulnerable, and [0] need help a lot. A lot. [0] suppose [0] feel mainly [0] need the help of a woman. [0]'m continually searching for a woman. a woman mother you, a woman're great in bed, a woman're like a sister, a woman're there when you want to see a woman, a woman're not there when you don't. [0] don't know where a woman are. Maybe a woman're around somewhere. [0]'ll find one, one of these days.\"\u2014Sellers on [0]'s need for women.Towards the end of filming, in early February 1964, [0] met Britt Ekland, a Swedish actress who had arrived in London to film Guns at Batasi. On 19 February 1964, just ten days after their's first meeting, their married. [0] soon showed signs of insecurity and paranoia; [0] would become highly anxious and jealous, for example, when Britt Ekland, a Swedish actress who had arrived in London to film Guns at Batasi starred opposite attractive men. Shortly after married, [0] started filming on location in Twentynine Palms, California, for Billy Wilder's's Kiss Me, Stupid, opposite Dean Martin and Kim Novak. The relationship between Billy Wilder's became strained; Sellers and Kubrick had different approaches to work and often clashed as a result. On the night of 5 April 1964, prior to having sex with Britt Ekland, a Swedish actress who had arrived in London to film Guns at Batasi, [0] inhaled amyl nitrites (poppers) as a sexual stimulant in [0]'s search for \"the ultimate orgasm\", and suffered a series of eight heart attacks over the course of three hours as a result. [0]'s illness forced [0] to withdraw from the filming of Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb and [0] was replaced by Ray Walston. Billy Wilder's was unsympathetic about eight heart attacks, saying that \"you have to have a heart before you can have an attack\".After some time recovering, [0] returned to filming in October 1964, playing King of the Individualists alongside Britt Ekland, a Swedish actress who had arrived in London to film Guns at Batasi in A Carol for Another Christmas, a feature-length United Nations special broadcast in the United States on the ABC channel on 28 December 1964. [0] had been concerned that eight heart attacks might have caused brain damage and that [0] would be unable to remember [0]'s lines, but [0] was reassured that [0]'s memory and abilities were unimpaired after the experience of filming. [0] followed this with the role of the perverted Austrian psychoanalyst Doctor Fritz Fassbender in Clive Donner's What's New Pussycat?, appearing alongside Peter O'Toole, Romy Schneider, Capucine, Paula Prentiss and Ursula Andress. Clive Donner's What's New Pussycat? was the first screenwriting and acting credit for Woody Allen, and featured [0] in a love triangle. Because of [0]'s poor health, producer Charles K. Feldman insured [0] at a cost of $360,000 ($3,396,824 in 2022 dollars).On 20 January 1965, their Britt Ekland, a Swedish actress who had arrived in London to film Guns at Batasi announced the birth of a daughter, Victoria. their moved to Rome in May to film After the Fox, an Anglo-Italian production in which their were both to appear. Clive Donner's What's New Pussycat? was directed by Vittorio De Sica, whose English Sellers struggled to understand. [0] attempted to have Vittorio De Sica, whose English Sellers struggled to understand fired, causing tensions on the set. [0] also became unhappy with Britt Ekland, a Swedish actress who had arrived in London to film Guns at Batasi's performance, straining their's relationship and triggering open arguments during one of which [0] threw a chair at Britt Ekland, a Swedish actress who had arrived in London to film Guns at Batasi. Despite these conflicts, the script was praised for the script's wit.Following the commercial success of What's New Pussycat?, producer Charles K. Feldman again brought together [0] and Woody Allen for producer Charles K. Feldman's next project, Casino Royale, which also starred Orson Welles; [0] signed a $1\u00a0million contract for Casino Royale, which also starred Orson Welles ($8,776,447 in 2022 dollars). Seven screenwriters worked on Casino Royale, which also starred Orson Welles, and filming was chaotic. To make matters worse, according to Britt Ekland, a Swedish actress who had arrived in London to film Guns at Batasi, [0] was \"so insecure, [0] won't trust anyone\". A poor working relationship quickly developed between Sellers and Welles: [0] eventually demanded that Sellers and Welles should not share the same set. [0] left Casino Royale, which also starred Orson Welles before [0]'s part was complete. A further agent's part was then written for Terence Cooper, to cover [0]'s departure.Shortly after leaving Casino Royale, which also starred Orson Welles, [0] was appointed a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE) in honour of [0]'s career achievements. The day before the investiture at Buckingham Palace, their Britt Ekland, a Swedish actress who had arrived in London to film Guns at Batasi argued, with Britt Ekland, a Swedish actress who had arrived in London to film Guns at Batasi scratching Britt Ekland, a Swedish actress who had arrived in London to film Guns at Batasi's face in the process; [0] had a make-up artist cover the marks. During [0]'s next film, The Bobo, which again co-starred Britt Ekland, a Swedish actress who had arrived in London to film Guns at Batasi, their's marital problems worsened. Three weeks into production in Italy, [0] told director Robert Parrish to fire Britt Ekland, a Swedish actress who had arrived in London to film Guns at Batasi, saying \"[0]'m not coming back after lunch if Britt Ekland, a Swedish actress who had arrived in London to film Guns at Batasi is on the set\". Britt Ekland, a Swedish actress who had arrived in London to film Guns at Batasi later stated that the marriage was \"an atrocious sham\" at this stage. In the midst of filming The Bobo, Sellers's mother had a heart attack; director Robert Parrish asked [0] if [0] wanted to visit Sellers's mother in hospital, but [0] remained on set. Sellers's mother died within days, without [0] having seen Sellers's mother. [0] was deeply affected by Sellers's mother's and remorseful at not having returned to London to see Sellers's mother. Britt Ekland, a Swedish actress who had arrived in London to film Guns at Batasi served [0] with divorce papers shortly afterwards. The divorce was finalised on 18 December 1968, and [0]'s friend Spike Milligan sent Britt Ekland, a Swedish actress who had arrived in London to film Guns at Batasi a congratulatory telegram. Upon The Bobo's release in September 1967, The Bobo was poorly received.[0]'s first film appearance of 1968 was a reunion with Blake Edwards for the fish-out-of-water comedy The Party, in which he starred alongside Claudine Longet and Denny Miller. [0] appears as Hrundi V. Bakshi, a bungling Indian actor who accidentally receives an invitation to a lavish Hollywood dinner party. Hrundi V. Bakshi, a bungling Indian actor who accidentally receives an invitation to a lavish Hollywood dinner party, according to Sellers's biographer Peter Evans, was \"clearly an amalgam of Clouseau and the doctor in The Millionairess\". Roger Lewis notes that like a number of [0]'s characters, Hrundi V. Bakshi, a bungling Indian actor who accidentally receives an invitation to a lavish Hollywood dinner party is played in a sympathetic and dignified manner. [0] followed the fish-out-of-water comedy The Party, in which he starred alongside Claudine Longet and Denny Miller later that year with Hy Averback's I Love You, Alice B. Toklas, playing an attorney who abandons his lifestyle to become a hippiean attorney who abandons his lifestyle to become a hippie's . Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the fish-out-of-water comedy The Party, in which he starred alongside Claudine Longet and Denny Miller three stars, remarking that [0] was \"back doing what [0] does best\", although Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times also said that in [0]'s previous films [0] had \"been at [0]'s worst recently\".In 1969 [0] starred opposite Ringo Starr in the Joseph McGrath-directed film The Magic Christian. [0] portrayed Sir Guy Grand, an eccentric billionaire who plays elaborate practical jokes on people. The critic Irv Slifkin remarked that the Joseph McGrath-directed film The Magic Christian was a reflection of the cynicism of Sellers's biographer Peter Evans, describing the Joseph McGrath-directed film The Magic Christian as a \"proto-Pythonesque adaption of Terry Southern's semi-free-form short novel\", and \"one of the strangest films to be shown at a gala premiere for Britain's royal family\". the Joseph McGrath-directed film The Magic Christian was in general viewed negatively by critics. Roger Greenspun of The Times believed that the Joseph McGrath-directed film The Magic Christian was of variable quality and summarised the Joseph McGrath-directed film The Magic Christian as a \"brutal satire\".", "1970\u20131978: \"Period of indifference\": two marriages, three Pink Panther films": "Peter Sellers is our person to focus on. After a cameo appearance in A Day at the Beach ([0]), and a serious role later in [0] as an aging businessman who seduces Sin\u00e9ad Cusack in Hoffman, Peter Sellers starred in Roy Boulting's There's a Girl in My Soup opposite Goldie Hawn. According to The Times, Roy Boulting's There's a Girl in My Soup was a major commercial success and became the seventh most popular film at the British box office in [0]. Andrew Spicer, writing for the British Film Institute's Screenonline, considers that although Peter Sellers favoured playing romantic roles, Peter Sellers \"was always more successful in parts that sent up Peter Sellers's own vanities and pretensions, as with the TV presenter and narcissistic lothario\" Peter Sellers played in Roy Boulting's There's a Girl in My Soup. Roy Boulting's There's a Girl in My Soup was seen as a small revival of his career.Peter Sellers's next films, including Rodney Amateau's Where Does It Hurt? (1972) and Peter Medak's Ghost in the Noonday Sun (1974), were again poorly received, and Peter Sellers's acting was viewed as frenetic rather than funny. Despite these setbacks, Peter Sellers won the Best Actor award at the 1973 Tehran Film Festival for Peter Sellers's tragi-comedic role as a street performer in Anthony Simmons's The Optimists of Nine Elms. Fellow comedian and friend Spike Milligan believed that the early 1970s were for Peter Sellers \"a period of indifference, and it would appear at one time that his career might have come to a conclusion\". believed was echoed by Peter Sellers's biographer, Peter Evans, who notes that out of nine films in the early 1970s, three were never released and five had flopped, while Roy Boulting's There's a Girl in My Soup had been a success. In Peter Sellers's private life, Peter Sellers had been seeing the twenty-three-year-old model Miranda Quarry. The couple married on 24 August [0], despite Peter Sellers's private doubts\u2014expressed to Peter Sellers's agent, Dennis Selinger\u2014about Peter Sellers's decision to remarry.In April 1972, Peter Sellers reunited with Fellow comedian and friend Spike Milligan and Harry Secombe to record The Last Goon Show of All, which was broadcast on 5 October. In May 1973, with Peter Sellers's third marriage failing, Peter Sellers went to the theatre to watch Liza Minnelli perform. Peter Sellers became entranced with Liza Minnelli and The couple became engaged three days later, despite Liza Minnelli's current betrothal to Desi Arnaz Jr., and Peter Sellers still being married. The couple's relationship lasted a month before breaking up. By 1974, Peter Sellers's friends were concerned that Peter Sellers was having a nervous breakdown. Directors John and Roy Boulting considered that Peter Sellers was \"a deeply troubled man, distrustful, self-absorbed, ultimately self-destructive. Peter Sellers was the complete contradiction.\" Peter Sellers was shy and insecure when out of character. When Peter Sellers was invited to appear on Michael Parkinson's's eponymous chat show in 1974, Peter Sellers withdrew the day before, explaining to Michael Parkinson's that \"Peter Sellers just can't walk on as Peter Sellers\". When Peter Sellers was told Peter Sellers could come on as someone else, Peter Sellers appeared dressed as a member of the Gestapo. After a few lines in keeping with a member of the Gestapo, Peter Sellers stepped out of a member of the Gestapo and settled down and, according to Michael Parkinson's, \"was brilliant, giving the audience an astonishing display of Michael Parkinson's's virtuosity\". In 1974, Peter Sellers again claimed to have communicated with the long-dead music hall comic Dan Leno, who advised Peter Sellers to return to a member of the Gestapo.In 1974, Peter Sellers portrayed a \"sexually voracious\" Queen Victoria in Joseph McGrath's comedic biographical film of the Scottish poet William McGonagall, The Great McGonagall, starring opposite Fellow comedian and friend Spike Milligan and Julia Foster. However, Joseph McGrath's comedic biographical film of the Scottish poet William McGonagall, The Great McGonagall was a critical failure, and Peter Sellers's career and life reached an all-time low. As a result, by 1974 Peter Sellers agreed to accept salaries of \u00a3100,000 and 10 per cent of the gross to appear in TV productions and advertisements, well below the \u00a31 million Peter Sellers had once commanded per film. In 1973, Peter Sellers appeared in a Benson & Hedges cinema commercial; in 1975, Peter Sellers appeared in a series of advertisements for Trans World Airlines, in which Peter Sellers played several eccentric characters, including Thrifty McTravel, Jeremy \"Piggy\" Peak Thyme and an Italian singer, Vito. Biographer Michael Starr asserts that Peter Sellers showed enthusiasm towards several eccentric characters, including Thrifty McTravel, Jeremy \"Piggy\" Peak Thyme and an Italian singer, Vito,  although the airline campaign failed commercially.A turning point in Peter Sellers's flailing career came in 1974, when Peter Sellers teamed up with Blake Edwards to make The Return of the Pink Panther, starring alongside Christopher Plummer, Herbert Lom and Catherine Schell. Roy Boulting's There's a Girl in My Soup was shot on a budget of \u00a33 million and earned $33 million at the box office upon release in May 1975, reinvigorating Peter Sellers's career as an A-list film star and restoring Peter Sellers's millionaire status. Roy Boulting's There's a Girl in My Soup earned Peter Sellers a nomination for the Best Actor\u00a0\u2013 Musical or Comedy award at the 33rd Golden Globe Awards. In 1975, Peter Sellers followed Roy Boulting's There's a Girl in My Soup with The Pink Panther Strikes Again. During the filming from February to June 1976, the already fraught relationship between Peter Sellers and Blake Edwards had seriously deteriorated. Blake Edwards says of Peter Sellers's mental state at the time of The Pink Panther Strikes Again, \"If you went to an asylum and you described the first inmate you saw, the first inmate you saw's what Peter Sellers had become. Peter Sellers was certifiable.\" With declining physical health, Peter Sellers could at times be unbearable on set. Peter Sellers's behaviour was regarded as unprofessional and childish, and Peter Sellers frequently threw tantrums, often threatening to abandon projects. Peter Sellers's difficult behaviour during productions was widely reported and made it more difficult for Peter Sellers to get employment in the industry at a time when Peter Sellers most needed the work. Despite Peter Sellers's deep personal problems, The Pink Panther Strikes Again was well received critically. Vincent Canby of The New York Times said of Peter Sellers in The Pink Panther Strikes Again, \"There is, too, something most winningly seedy about Peter Sellers's Clouseau, a fellow who, when Peter Sellers attempts to tear off Peter Sellers's clothes in the heat of passion, gets tangled up in Peter Sellers's necktie, and who, when Peter Sellers masquerades\u2014for reasons never gone into\u2014as Quasimodo, overinflates Peter Sellers's hump with helium.\" Peter Sellers's performance earned Peter Sellers a further nomination at the 34th Golden Globe Awards.In March 1976, Peter Sellers began dating actress Lynne Frederick, whom he married on 18 February 1977. Biographer Roger Lewis documents that of all of Peter Sellers's wives, actress Lynne Frederick, whom he married on 18 February 1977 was the most poorly treated; Julian Upton likened it to a boxing match between a heavyweight and a featherweight, it.\" On 20 March 1977, Peter Sellers suffered a second major heart attack during a flight from Paris to London; Peter Sellers was subsequently fitted with a pacemaker. Peter Sellers returned from Peter Sellers's illness to undertake The Return of the Pink Panther; although The Return of the Pink Panther was a commercial success, the critics were tiring of Clouseau. Julian Upton expressed the view that the strain behind the scenes began to manifest the strain behind the scenes in the sluggish pace of The Pink Panther Strikes Again, describing The Pink Panther Strikes Again as a \"laboured, stunt-heavy hotchpotch of half-baked ideas and rehashed gags\". Peter Sellers too had become tired of Clouseau, saying after production, \"Peter Sellers've honestly had enough of Clouseau\u2014I've got nothing more to give\". Steven Bach, the senior vice-president and head of worldwide productions for United Artists, who worked with Peter Sellers on The Return of the Pink Panther, considered that Peter Sellers was \"deeply unbalanced, if not committable: was was the source of Peter Sellers's genius and Peter Sellers's truly quite terrifying aspects as manipulator and hysteric.\" Peter Sellers refused to seek professional help for Peter Sellers's mental issues. Peter Sellers would claim that Peter Sellers had no personality and was almost unnoticeable, which meant that Peter Sellers \"needed a strongly defined character to play.\" Peter Sellers would make similar references throughout Peter Sellers's life: when Peter Sellers appeared on The Muppet Show in 1972, a guest appearance that earned Peter Sellers an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Continuing or Single Performance by a Supporting Actor in Variety or Music, Peter Sellers chose not to appear as Peter Sellers, instead appearing in a variety of costumes and accents. When Kermit the Frog told Peter Sellers Peter Sellers could relax and be Peter Sellers, Peter Sellers replied: But that, you see, Kermit the Frog, would be altogether impossible. Peter Sellers could never be Peter Sellers\u00a0... You see, there is no me. Peter Sellers do not exist\u00a0... There used to be a me, but Peter Sellers had a me surgically removed. ", "1979\u20131980: Being There, Fu Manchu, and continued domestic problems": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 1979, [0] starred alongside Lynne Frederick, Lionel Jeffries and Elke Sommer in Richard Quine's The Prisoner of Zenda. [0] portrayed three roles, including King Rudolf IV and King Rudolf V\u2014rulers of the fictional small nation of Ruritania\u2014and Syd Frewin, King Rudolf V's half-brother. Upon Richard Quine's The Prisoner of Zenda's release in May 1979, Richard Quine's The Prisoner of Zenda was well received; Janet Maslin of The New York Times observed how [0] divided \"[0]'s energies between a serious character and a funny one, but that it was [0]'s serious performance which was more impressive\". However, Philip French, for The Observer, was unimpressed by Richard Quine's The Prisoner of Zenda, describing Richard Quine's The Prisoner of Zenda as \"a mess of porridge\" and stating that \"[0] reveals that [0] cannot draw the line between the sincere and the sentimental\".Later in 1979, [0] starred opposite Shirley MacLaine, Melvyn Douglas and Jack Warden in the black comedy Being There as Chance, a simple-minded gardener addicted to watching TV who is regarded as a sage by the rich and powerful. In a BBC interview in 1971, [0] had said that more than anything else, [0] wanted to play Chance, a simple-minded gardener addicted to watching TV who is regarded as a sage by the rich and powerful, and successfully persuaded the author of the book, Jerzy Kosinski, to allow [0] and director Hal Ashby to make the black comedy Being There, provided the author of the book, Jerzy Kosinski, could write the script. During filming, to remain in Chance, a simple-minded gardener addicted to watching TV who is regarded as a sage by the rich and powerful, [0] refused most interview requests and kept [0]'s distance from the other actors. [0] considered Chance, a simple-minded gardener addicted to watching TV who is regarded as a sage by the rich and powerful's walking and voice Chance, a simple-minded gardener addicted to watching TV who is regarded as a sage by the rich and powerful's most important attributes, and in preparing for Chance, a simple-minded gardener addicted to watching TV who is regarded as a sage by the rich and powerful worked alone with a tape recorder or with [0]'s wife, and then with director Hal Ashby, to perfect the clear enunciation and flat delivery needed to reveal \"the childlike mind behind the words\". [0] described [0]'s experience of working on the black comedy Being There as \"so humbling, so powerful\", and Shirley MacLaine found [0] \"a dream\" to work with. [0]'s performance was universally lauded by critics and is considered by critic Danny Smith to be the \"crowning triumph of [0]'s remarkable career\". Critic Frank Rich wrote that the acting skill required for this sort of role, with a \"schismatic personality that [0] had to convey with strenuous vocal and gestural technique\u00a0... A lesser actor would have made Chance, a simple-minded gardener addicted to watching TV who is regarded as a sage by the rich and powerful's mental dysfunction flamboyant and drastic\u00a0... [[0]'s] intelligence was always deeper, [0]'s onscreen confidence greater, [0]'s technique much more finely honed\": in achieving this, [0] \"makes the black comedy Being There's fantastic premise credible\". the black comedy Being There earned [0] a Best Actor award at the 51st National Board of Review Awards; the London Critics Circle Film Awards Special Achievement Award, the Best Actor award at the 45th New York Film Critics Circle Awards; and the Best Actor\u00a0\u2013 Musical or Comedy award at the 37th Golden Globe Awards. Additionally, [0] was nominated for the Best Actor award at the 52nd Academy Awards and the Best Actor in a Leading Role award at the 34th British Academy Film Awards.In March 1980, [0] asked his 15-year-old daughter Victoria what his 15-year-old daughter Victoria thought about Being There: his 15-year-old daughter Victoria reported later that \"his 15-year-old daughter Victoria said yes, his 15-year-old daughter Victoria thought Being was great. But then his 15-year-old daughter Victoria said, '[0] looked like a little fat old man'.\u00a0... [0] went mad. [0] threw [0]'s drink over his 15-year-old daughter Victoria and told his 15-year-old daughter Victoria to get the next plane home.\" His other daughter Sarah told [0] His other daughter Sarah's thoughts about the incident and [0] sent His other daughter Sarah a telegram that read \"After what happened this morning with his 15-year-old daughter Victoria, [0] shall be happy if [0] never hear from His other daughter Sarah again. [0] won't tell His other daughter Sarah what [0] think of His other daughter Sarah. It must be obvious. Goodbye, His other daughter Sarah's .[0]'s last film was The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu, a comedic re-imagining of the eponymous adventure novels by Sax Rohmer; [0] played both police inspector Nayland Smith and Fu Manchu, alongside Helen Mirren and David Tomlinson. The production of Dr. Fu Manchu, a comedic re-imagining of the eponymous adventure novels by Sax Rohmer was troublesome before filming started, with two directors\u2014Richard Quine and John Avildsen\u2014fired before the script had been completed. [0] also expressed dissatisfaction with [0]'s own portrayal of Fu Manchu with [0]'s ill-health often causing delays. Arguments between [0] and director Piers Haggard led to director Piers Haggard's firing at [0]'s instigation and [0] took over direction, using [0]'s long-time friend David Lodge to direct some sequences. Tom Shales of The Washington Post described Dr. Fu Manchu, a comedic re-imagining of the eponymous adventure novels by Sax Rohmer as \"an indefensibly inept comedy\", adding that \"it is hard to name another good actor who ever made so many bad movies as [0]. Dr. Fu Manchu, a comedic re-imagining of the eponymous adventure novels by Sax Rohmer will take Dr. Fu Manchu, a comedic re-imagining of the eponymous adventure novels by Sax Rohmer's rightful place alongside such colossally ill-advised washouts as Tell Me Where It Hurts, The Bobo and The Prisoner of Zenda\".[0]'s final performances were a series of advertisements for Barclays Bank. Filmed in April 1980 in Ireland, [0] played Monty Casino, a Jewish con-man. Four advertisements were scheduled, but only three were filmed as [0] collapsed in Dublin, again with heart problems. After two days in care\u2014and against the advice of [0]'s doctors\u2014[0] travelled to the Cannes Film Festival, where Being There was in competition. [0] was again ill in the Cannes Film Festival, where Being There was in competition, returning to [0]'s residence in Gstaad to work on the script for [0]'s next project, Romance of the Pink Panther. At the urging of [0]'s friends, [0] made an appointment to undergo an angiogram at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on 30 July 1980, to see if [0] was able to undergo open-heart surgery. Spike Milligan later considered that [0]'s heart condition had lasted for over 15 years and had \"made life difficult for [0] and had a debilitating effect on [0]'s personality.\" [0]'s fourth marriage to Lynne Frederick collapsed soon after.[0] had recently started to rebuild [0]'s relationship with his son Michael after the failure of his son Michael's marriage. In lighter moments, [0] had joked that [0]'s epitaph should read \"[0].\"", "Death and subsequent family issues": "[0] is our person to focus on. On 21 July 1980, [0] arrived in London from Geneva. [0] checked into the Dorchester hotel, before visiting Golders Green Crematorium for the first time to see the location of [0]'s parents' ashes. [0] had plans to attend a reunion dinner with his Goon Show partners Milligan and Secombe, scheduled for the evening of 22 July. On the day of a reunion dinner with his Goon Show partners Milligan and Secombe, scheduled for the evening of 22 July, [0] took lunch in [0]'s hotel suite and shortly afterwards collapsed from a heart attack. [0] was taken to the Middlesex Hospital, London, and died just after midnight on 24 July 1980, aged 54.Following [0]'s , fellow actor Richard Attenborough said that [0] \"had the genius comparable to Chaplin\", while the Boulting brothers considered [0] as \"a man of enormous gifts; and these gifts he gave to the world. For these gifts he gave to the world, [0] is assured of a place in the history of art as entertainment.\" Burt Kwouk, who appeared as Cato in the Pink Panther films, stated that \"[0] was a well-loved actor in Britain\u00a0... the day [0] died, it seemed that Britain came to a stop. Everywhere you went, the fact that [0] had died seemed like an umbrella over everything\". Director Blake Edwards thought that \"[0] was brilliant. [0] had an enormous facility for finding really unusual, unique facets of the character [0] was playing\". [0]'s Goon Show was too upset to speak to the press at the time of [0]'s , while Secombe said \"Secombe'm shattered. [0] was such a tremendous artist. [0] had so much talent, so much talent just oozed out of [0]\"; in dark humour, referring to the missed dinner the Goons had planned, Secombe added, \"Anything to avoid paying for dinner\". Secombe later declared to journalists \"Bluebottle is deaded now\". Milligan later said that \"it's hard to say this, but [0] died at the right time.\"A private funeral service was held at Golders Green Crematorium on 26 July, conducted by [0]'s old friend, Canon John Hester. [0]'s final joke was the playing of \"In the Mood\" by Glenn Miller, a tune which all the Goons hated; [0] knew the Goons would have to sit there in silence and listen to the playing of \"In the Mood\" by Glenn Miller, a tune which all the Goons hated. A memorial service was held at St Martin-in-the-Fields on 8 September 1980\u2014what would have been [0]'s 55th birthday. Close friend Lord Snowdon read the twenty-third Psalm, Secombe sang \"Bread of Heaven\" and the eulogy was read by David Niven.Although [0] was reportedly in the process of excluding Frederick from [0]'s will a week before [0] died, Frederick inherited almost [0]'s entire estate worth an estimated \u00a34.5 million (\u00a320.5 million in 2022 pounds) while his children received \u00a3800 each (\u00a33,649 in 2022 pounds). Milligan appealed to Frederick on behalf of his children, but Frederick refused to increase the amount.

A feature of the characterisations undertaken by [0] is that, regardless of how clumsy or idiotic his characters are, [0] ensured that his characters always retain his characters's dignity. On [0]'s playing of Clouseau, [0] said: \"[0] set out to play Clouseau with great dignity because [0] feel that Clouseau thinks Clouseau is probably one of the greatest detectives in the world. The original script makes Clouseau out to be a complete idiot. [0] thought a forgivable vanity would humanise Clouseau and make Clouseau kind of touching.[0]'s biographer, Ed Sikov, notes that because of this retained dignity, [0] is \"the master of playing men who have no idea how ridiculous they aremen who have no idea how ridiculous they are .\" Social historian Sam Wasson notes the complexity in [0]'s performances in the Pink Panther films, which has the effect of alienating Clouseau from Clouseau's environment. Wesson considers that \"As 'low' and 'high' comedy rolled into one, it's the performative counterpoint to Edwardian sophisticated naturalism\". This combination of \"high\" and \"low\", exemplified by Clouseau's attempting to retain dignity after a fall, means that within it Clouseau was \"the sole representative of humanity\". Film critic Dilys Powell also saw the inherent dignity in the parts and wrote that [0] had a \"balance between character and absurdity\". Richard Attenborough also thought that because of [0]'s sympathy, [0] could \"inject into [0]'s characterisations the frailty and substance of a human being\".[0] was a marvelous improvisational actor, brilliant if you got [0] on the first take. The second take would be good, but after the third take [0] could be really awful. If [0] had to repeat the same words too many times the same words became meaningless. But it was such a joy to work with [0] because [0] was such an inspired actor. Sometimes [0] would literally knock me off me's feet. me\u2019d fall down convulsed with laughter.\u201d  \u2014me, on directing [0] in The Mouse That Roared.Author Aaron Sultanik observed that in [0]'s early films, such as I'm All Right Jack, [0] displays \"deft, technical interpretations [that] pinpoint the mechanical nature of [0]'s comic characterization\", which \"reduces each of [0]'s characters to a series of gross, awkward tics\". Academic Cynthia Baron observed that [0]'s external characterisations led to doubt with reviewers as to whether [0]'s work was \"true\" acting. Critic Tom Milne saw a change over [0]'s career and thought that [0]'s \"comic genius as a character actor was\u00a0... stifled by [0]'s elevation to leading man\" and [0]'s later films suffered as a result. Author Aaron Sultanik agreed, commenting that [0]'s \"exceptional vocal and physical technique\" was under-used during [0]'s career in the US.Academics Maria Pramaggiore and Tom Wallis remarked that [0] fits the mould of a technical actor because [0] displays a mastery of physical characterisation, such as accent or physical trait. Writer and playwright John Mortimer saw the process for Writer and playwright John Mortimer when [0] was about to undertake filming on Writer and playwright John Mortimer's The Dock Brief and could not decide how to play the character of the barrister. By chance Writer and playwright John Mortimer ordered cockles for lunch and the smell brought back a memory of the seaside town of Morecambe: the smell gave Writer and playwright John Mortimer \"the idea of a faded North Country accent and the suggestion of a scrappy moustache\". So important was the voice as the starting point for character development, that Sellers would walk around London with a reel-to-reel tape recorder, recording voices to study at home."}, "Legacy": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. New York magazine stated that all of the films starring [0] as Clouseau showcased [0]'s \"comedic brilliance\".

Eddie Izzard notes that Goon Show \"influenced a new generation of comedians who came to be known as 'alternative'\"\u2014including Eddie Izzard, while the media historian Graham McCann states \"the anarchic spirit of Goon Show\u00a0... would inspire, directly or indirectly and to varying extents,\u00a0...
