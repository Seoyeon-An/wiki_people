[0]'s success at popularizing the tabloid talk show genre opened up a thriving industry that has included Ricki Lake, The Jenny Jones Show, and The Jerry Springer Show.

In the book Freaks Talk Back's editorial review, Michael Bronski wrote, \"In the recent past, lesbians, gay men, bisexuals, and transgendered people had almost no presence on television.

Being recognized by [0] often means a million additional book sales for an author. In Reading with Oprah: The Book Club that Changed America (2005), Kathleen Rooney describes [0] as \"a serious American intellectual who pioneered the use of electronic media, specifically television and the Internet, to take reading \u2013 a decidedly non-technological and highly individual act \u2013 and highlight reading \u2013 a decidedly non-technological and highly individual act's social elements and uses in such a way to motivate millions of erstwhile non-readers to pick up books.\"When author Jonathan Franzen's book was selected for the Oprah's Book Club, author Jonathan Franzen's reportedly \"cringed\" and said selected books tend to be \"schmaltzy\".
