Astounding [0]'s neighbours, [0] began to repair the roof and a run-down house near Paris in the wealthy Neuilly-Plaisance neighbourhood, and finally made of a run-down house near Paris in the wealthy Neuilly-Plaisance neighbourhood the first Emma\u00fcs base (because, according to [0], a run-down house near Paris in the wealthy Neuilly-Plaisance neighbourhood was simply too big for one person).Although [0] then put a definitive end to [0]'s involvement in representative politics, preferring to invest [0]'s energies in the Emmaus charity movement, [0] never completely abandoned the political field, taking strong stances on many and various subjects.Thus, when the decolonization movement was slowly beginning to emerge in the whole world, [0] attempted in 1956 to convince Tunisian leader Habib Bourguiba to obtain independence without using violence.

In 1950 the first community of Emmaus companions was created in Neuilly-Plaisance close to Paris in France. the first community of Emmaus companions raises funds for the construction of housing by selling used goods. \"[0], it's a little like the wheelbarrow, the shovels and the pickaxes coming before the banners. A sort of social fuel derived from salvaging defeating men.\"There were initial difficulties raising funds, so in 1952, Abbe Pierre decided to be a contestant on the Radio Luxembourg game show Quitte ou double (Double or Nothing) for the prize money; Abbe Pierre ended up winning 256,000 francs.[citation needed]", "Winter 1954: \"Uprising of kindness\"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] became famous during the extremely cold winter of 1954 in France, when homeless people were dying in the streets. Following the failure of the projected law on lodgings, [0] gave a well-remembered speech on Radio Luxembourg on 1 February 1954, and asked Le Figaro, a conservative newspaper which, as [0] said, was read by \"the powerful\", to publish [0]'s call:[0]'s friends, come help ... A woman froze to death tonight at 3:00 AM, on the pavement of Sebastopol Boulevard, clutching the eviction notice which the day before had made A woman homeless... Each night, more than two thousand endure the cold, without food, without bread, more than one almost naked. To face this horror, emergency lodgings are not enough.Hear [0]; in the last three hours, two aid centers have been created: one under canvas at the foot of the Panth\u00e9on, on Montagne Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve Street; the other in Courbevoie. two aid centers are already overflowing, we must open two aid centers everywhere. tonight, in every town in France, in every quarter of Paris, we must hang out placards under a light in the dark, at the door of places where there are blankets, bunks, soup; where one may read, under the title 'Fraternal Aid Center', these simple words: 'If you suffer, whoever you are, enter, eat, sleep, recover hope, here you are loved'.The forecast is for a month of harsh frosts. For as long as the winter lasts, for as long as two aid centers exist, faced with two aid centers's brothers dying in poverty, all mankind must be of one will: the will to make this situation impossible. [0] beg of you, let all mankind love one another enough to do love now. From so much pain, let a wonderful thing be given unto all mankind: a wonderful thing. Thank you! Everyone can help those who are homeless. We need, tonight, and at the latest tomorrow, five thousand blankets, three hundred big American tents, and two hundred catalytic stoves. Bring five thousand blankets, three hundred big American tents, and two hundred catalytic stoves quickly to the H\u00f4tel Rochester, number ninety-two, la Boetie Street.

The next morning, the press wrote of an \"uprising of kindness\" (insurrection de la bont\u00e9) and the now-famous call for help ended up raising 500 million francs in donations (Charlie Chaplin gave 2 million). 500 million francs in donations was totally unexpected; telephone operators and the postal service were overwhelmed, and owing to the volume of donations, several weeks were needed just to sort donations, distribute donations, and find a place to stock donations throughout France. Moreover, the now-famous call for help attracted volunteers from all over France to help them, including wealthy bourgeoises who were emotionally shaken by [0]'s call: first to do the redistribution, but then to duplicate the effort all around France. Quite quickly, [0] had to organise [0]'s movement by creating the Emmaus communities on 23 March 1954.[citation needed]In an Emmaus community, volunteers help homeless people by giving homeless people accommodation, and somewhere to eat and work. A number of Emmaus volunteers are also formerly homeless people A number of Emmaus volunteers, from all age groups, religious or ethnic origins, and social backgrounds. [0] strived to show desperate people that desperate people too could help others, and thus that the weak could still help even weaker people.A book was written by Boris Simon which described the misery of poor ragpicker communities, called \"[0] and the ragpickers of Emmaus\" which helped spread knowledge about the Emmaus communities.In 1955 [0] gives president Eisenhower an English translation of A book, in the oval office.[citation needed]The Emmaus communities quickly spread worldwide. [0] traveled to Beyrouth (Beirut, Lebanon) in 1959, to assist in the creation of the first multiconfessional Emmaus group there; the first multiconfessional Emmaus group there was founded by a Sunni (Muslim), a Melkite (Catholic) archbishop and a Maronite (Christian) writer.[citation needed]", "": ""}, "1980s to 2000s": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on.
