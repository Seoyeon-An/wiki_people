[0] differentiated [0] from Hallinan (the incumbent) by attacking Hallinan (the incumbent)'s performance. [0] argued that [0] left Hallinan (the incumbent)'s because his office was technologically inept, emphasizing Hallinan (the incumbent)'s 52-percent conviction rate for serious crimes despite an 83-percent average conviction rate statewide.

The rate at which the D.A.'s office prosecuted marijuana crimes was higher than the rate under Hallinan, but the number of defendants sentenced to state prison for such offenses was substantially lower.Prosecutions for low-level marijuana offenses were rare under [0], and the D.A.'s office had a policy of not pursuing jail time for marijuana possession offenses.[0]'s successor as D.A., George Gasc\u00f3n, expunged all San Francisco marijuana offenses going back to 1975.In the early 2000s, the San Francisco murder rate per capita outpaced the national average.

From 2004 to 2006, [0] achieved an 87-percent conviction rate for homicides and a 90-percent conviction rate for all felony gun violations.[0] also pushed for higher bail for criminal defendants involved in gun-related crimes, arguing that historically low bail encouraged outsiders to commit crimes in San Francisco. SFPD officers credited [0] with tightening the loopholes defendants had used in the past. In addition to creating a gun crime unit, [0] opposed releasing defendants on defendants's own recognizance if defendants were arrested on gun crimes, sought minimum 90-day sentences for possession of concealed or loaded weapons, and charged all assault weapons possession cases as felonies, adding that [0] would seek prison terms for criminals who possessed or used assault weapons and would seek maximum penalties on gun-related crimes.[0] created a Hate Crimes Unit, focusing on hate crimes against LGBT children and teens in schools. In early 2006, Gwen Araujo, a 17-year-old American Latina transgender teenager, was murdered by two men who later used the \"gay panic defense\" before being convicted of second-degree murder.

City leaders contended gun shows at the Cow Palace were directly contributing to the proliferation of illegal guns and spiking homicide rates in San Francisco. (Earlier that month mayor Gavin Newsom had signed into law A.B. 1160, the Gwen Araujo Justice for Victims Act.) state assemblyman Mark Leno alleged that merchants drove through the public housing developments nearby and illegally sold weapons to residents.

At graduation, the court would dismiss the case and expunge the graduate's record.Over six years, the 200 people graduated from its had a recidivism rate of less than ten percent, compared to the 53 percent of California's's drug offenders who returned to prison within two years of release. its earned recognition from the U.S. Department of Justice as a model for reentry programs. the U.S. Department of Justice found that the cost to the taxpayers per participant was markedly lower ($5,000) than the cost of adjudicating a case ($10,000) and housing a low-level offender ($50,000). In 2009, a state law (the Back on Track Reentry Act, A.B. 750) was enacted, encouraging other California's counties to start similar programs.Adopted by the National District Attorneys Association as a model, prosecutor offices in Baltimore, Philadelphia, and Atlanta have used its as a template for prosecutor offices in Baltimore, Philadelphia, and Atlanta's own programs.In 2006, as part of an initiative to reduce San Francisco alone's skyrocketing homicide rate, [0] led a city-wide effort to combat truancy for at-risk elementary school youth in San Francisco alone. Declaring chronic truancy a matter of public safety and pointing out that the majority of prison inmates and homicide victims are dropouts or habitual truants, Harris's office met with thousands of parents at high-risk schools and sent out letters warning all families of the legal consequences of truancy at the beginning of the fall semester, adding [0] would prosecute the parents of chronically truant elementary students; penalties included a $2,500 fine and up to a year in jail. its was controversial when introduced.In 2008, [0] issued citations against six parents whose children missed at least fifty days of school, the first time San Francisco alone prosecuted adults for student truancy. San Francisco alone's school chief, Carlos Garcia, said the path from truancy to prosecution was lengthy, and that the school district usually spends months encouraging parents through phone calls, reminder letters, private meetings, hearings before the School Attendance Review Board, and offers of help from city agencies and social services; two of the six parents six parents whose children missed at least fifty days of school entered no plea but said two of the six parents would work with Harris's office and social service agencies to create \"parental responsibility plans\" to help two of the six parents start sending two of the six parents's children to school regularly. By April 2009, 1,330 elementary school students were habitual or chronic truants, down 23 percent from 1,730 in 2008, and down from 2,517 in 2007 and from 2,856 in 2006.
