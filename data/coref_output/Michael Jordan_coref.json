The Chicago Bulls selected [0] with the third overall pick of the 1984 NBA draft after Hakeem Olajuwon (Houston Rockets) and Sam Bowie (Portland Trail Blazers). One of the primary reasons why [0] was not drafted sooner was because the first two teams were in need of a center. Portland Trail Blazers general manager Stu Inman contended that it was not a matter of drafting a center but more a matter of taking Sam Bowie (Portland Trail Blazers) over [0], in part because Portland already had Clyde Drexler, who was a guard with similar skills to [0].

The Chicago Bulls finished in first place in The Chicago Bulls's division for the first time in sixteen years and set a franchise record with 61 wins in the regular season. With Scottie Pippen developing into an All-Star, The Chicago Bulls had elevated The Chicago Bulls's play. The Chicago Bulls defeated New York Knicks and Philadelphia 76ers in the opening two rounds of the playoffs. The Chicago Bulls advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals where the more experienced Detroit Pistons, who were led by Isiah Thomas and a group of physical players known as the \"Bad Boys\" awaited The Chicago Bulls; this time, The Chicago Bulls beat the more experienced Detroit Pistons, who were led by Isiah Thomas and a group of physical players known as the \"Bad Boys\" in a four-game sweep.The Chicago Bulls advanced to the Finals for the first time in franchise history to face the Los Angeles Lakers, who had Magic Johnson and James Worthy, two formidable opponents. The Chicago Bulls won the series four games to one, and compiled a 15\u20132 playoff record along the way. Perhaps the best-known moment of the series came in Game 2 when, attempting a dunk, [0] avoided a potential Sam Perkins block by switching the ball from [0]'s right hand to [0]'s left in mid-air to lay the shot into the basket. In [0]'s first Finals appearance, [0] had 31.2 ppg on 56% shooting from the field, 11.4 apg, 6.6 rpg, 2.8 spg, and 1.4 bpg.

After the sixth three-pointer, [0] jogged down the court shrugging as [0] looked courtside.

Coincidentally, Jordan and the Bulls met his friend Charles Barkley and his friend Charles Barkley's Phoenix Suns in the 1993 NBA Finals. The Chicago Bulls won their third NBA championship on a game-winning shot by John Paxson and a last-second block by Horace Grant, but [0] was once again The Chicago Bulls's leader.

In 1996, [0] founded a Chicago-area Boys & Girls Club and dedicated a Chicago-area Boys & Girls Club to his father. In [0]'s 1998 autobiography For the Love of the Game, [0] wrote that [0] was preparing for his return as early as the summer of 1992. The added exhaustion due to the \"Dream Team\" run in the 1992 Summer Olympics solidified [0]'s feelings about the Game and [0]'s ever-growing celebrity status.

[0]'s competitiveness was visible in [0]'s prolific trash talk and well-known work ethic. [0] often used perceived slights to fuel [0]'s performances. Sportswriter Wright Thompson described [0] as \"a killer, in the Darwinian sense of the word, immediately sensing and attacking someone's weakest spot\". As the Bulls organization built the Bulls around [0], management had to trade away players who were not \"tough enough\" to compete with [0] in practice. To help improve [0]'s defense, [0] spent extra hours studying film of opponents. On offense, [0] relied more upon instinct and improvization at game time.Noted as a durable player, [0] did not miss four or more games while active for a full season from 1986\u201387 to 2001\u201302, when [0] injured [0]'s right knee.
