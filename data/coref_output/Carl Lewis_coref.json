[0] was born in Birmingham, Alabama, on July 1, 1961, the son of William Lewis (1927\u20131987) and Evelyn n\u00e9e Lawler Lewis. Evelyn n\u00e9e Lawler Lewis was a hurdler on the 1951 Pan-Am team. [0]'s elder brother Cleveland Lewis played professional soccer for the Memphis Rogues. William Lewis (1927\u20131987) and Evelyn n\u00e9e Lawler Lewis ran a local athletics club that provided a crucial influence on both [0] and his sister, Carol. his sister, Carol became an elite long jumper, finishing ninth at the 1984 Olympics and taking bronze at the 1983 World Championships.[0] was initially coached by William Lewis (1927\u20131987). At age 13, [0] began competing in the long jump, and [0] emerged as a promising athlete while coached by Andy Dudek and Paul Minore at Willingboro High School in [0]'s hometown of Willingboro Township, New Jersey. [0] achieved the ranking of fourth on the all-time World Junior list of long jumpers.Many colleges tried to recruit [0], and [0] chose to enroll at the University of Houston where Tom Tellez was coach. Tom Tellez would thereafter remain [0]'s coach for [0]'s entire career. Days after graduating from high school in 1979, [0] broke the high school long jump record with a leap of 8.13\u00a0m (26\u00a0ft 8\u00a0in). By the end of 1979, [0] was ranked fifth in the world for the long jump, according to Track and Field News.An old knee injury had flared up again at the end of the high school year, and flared might have had consequences on [0]'s fitness. [0] worked with Tom Tellez and adapted [0]'s technique so that [0] was able to jump without pain, and [0] went on to win the 1980 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) title with a wind-assisted jump of 8.35\u00a0m (27\u00a0ft 4+1\u20442\u00a0in).Though [0]'s focus was on the long jump, [0] was now starting to emerge as a talent in the sprints. Comparisons were beginning to be made with Jesse Owens, who dominated sprint and long jump events in the 1930s. [0] qualified for the American team for the 1984 Olympics in the long jump and as a member of the 4 \u00d7 100\u00a0m relay team. The Olympic boycott precluded [0] from competing in Moscow; [0] instead participated in the Liberty Bell Classic in July 1980, which was an alternate meet for boycotting nations. [0] jumped 7.77\u00a0m (25\u00a0ft 5+3\u20444\u00a0in) for a bronze medal, and the 4 \u00d7 100\u00a0m relay team won gold with a time of 38.61\u00a0s. [0] received one of 461 Congressional Gold Medals created especially for the athletes precluded from competing in the 1984 Olympics. At year's end, [0] was ranked sixth in the world in the long jump and seventh in the 100\u00a0m.", "Breakthrough in 1981 and 1982": "[0] is our person to focus on. At the start of 1981, [0]'s best legal long jump was [0]'s high school record from 1979. On June 20, [0] improved [0]'s personal best by almost half a meter by leaping 8.62\u00a0m (28\u00a0ft 3+1\u20444\u00a0in) at the TAC Championships while still a teenager.While marks set at the thinner air of high altitude are eligible for world records, [0] was determined to set [0]'s records at sea level. In response to a question about [0]'s skipping a 1982 long jump competition at altitude, [0] said, \"[0] want the record and [0] plan to get the record, but not at altitude. [0] don't want that '(A)' [for altitude] after the mark.\" When [0] gained prominence in the early 1980s, all the extant men's 100\u00a0m and 200\u00a0m records and the long jump record had been set at the high altitude of Mexico City.Also in 1981, [0] became the fastest 100\u00a0m sprinter in the world. [0]'s relatively modest best from 1979 (10.67\u00a0s) improved to a world-class 10.21 the next year. But 1981 saw [0] run 10.00\u00a0s at the Southwest Conference Championships in Dallas on May 16, a time that was the third-fastest in history and stood as the low-altitude record. For the first time, [0] was ranked number one in the world, in both the 100\u00a0m and the long jump. [0] won [0]'s first national titles in the 100\u00a0m and long jump. Additionally, [0] won the James E. Sullivan Award as the top amateur athlete in the United States.In 1982, [0] continued [0]'s dominance, and for the first time it seemed someone might challenge Bob Beamon's's world record of 8.90\u00a0m (29\u00a0ft 2+1\u20444\u00a0in) in the long jump set at the 1968 Olympics, a mark often described as one of the greatest athletic achievements ever. Before [0], 28\u00a0ft\u00a00\u00a0in\u00a0(8.53\u00a0m) had been exceeded on two occasions by two people: Bob Beamon's and 1980 Olympic champion Lutz Dombrowski. During 1982, [0] cleared 28\u00a0ft\u00a00\u00a0in\u00a0(8.53\u00a0m) five times outdoors, twice more indoors, going as far as 8.76\u00a0m (28\u00a0ft 8+3\u20444\u00a0in) at Indianapolis on July 24. [0] also ran 10.00\u00a0s in the 100\u00a0m, the world's fastest time, matching [0]'s low-altitude record from 1981. [0] achieved his 10.00\u00a0s clocking the same weekend [0] leapt 8.61\u00a0m (28\u00a0ft 2+3\u20444\u00a0in) twice, and the day [0] recorded [0]'s new low-altitude record 8.76\u00a0m (28\u00a0ft 8+3\u20444\u00a0in) at Indianapolis, [0] had three fouls with [0]'s toe barely over the board, two of which seemed to exceed Bob Beamon's's record, the third which several observers said reached 30\u00a0ft\u00a00\u00a0in\u00a0(9.14\u00a0m). [0] said [0] should have been credited with reached, claiming the track officials misinterpreted the rules on fouls.[0] repeated [0]'s number one ranking in the 100\u00a0m and long jump, and ranked number six in the 200\u00a0m. Additionally, [0] was named Athlete of the Year by Track and Field News. From 1981 until 1982, [0] topped the 100\u00a0m ranking six times (seven if Ben Johnson's 1987 top ranking is ignored), and ranked no lower than third. [0]'s dominance in the long jump was even greater, as [0] topped the 100\u00a0m ranking nine times during the same period, and ranked second in the other years.", "1983 and the inaugural World Championships": "[0] is our person to focus on. The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), the governing body of track and field, organized the first World Championships in 1983. [0]'s chief rival in the long jump was predicted to be the man who last beat him: Larry Myricks. But though the man who last beat him: Larry Myricks had joined [0] in surpassing 28\u00a0ft\u00a00\u00a0in\u00a0(8.53\u00a0m) the year before, the man who last beat him: Larry Myricks failed to qualify for the American team, and [0] won at Helsinki with relative ease. [0]'s winning leap of 8.55\u00a0m (28\u00a0ft 1\u20442\u00a0in) defeated silver medalist Jason Grimes by 0.26\u00a0m (10\u00a0in).He also won the 100\u00a0m with relative ease. There, Calvin Smith who had earlier that year set a new world record in the 100\u00a0m at altitude with a 9.93\u00a0s performance, was soundly beaten by [0] 10.07\u00a0s to 10.21\u00a0s. Calvin Smith who had earlier that year set a new world record in the 100\u00a0m at altitude with a 9.93\u00a0s performance, won the 200\u00a0m title, an event which Lewis had not entered, but even there Calvin Smith who had earlier that year set a new world record in the 100\u00a0m at altitude with a 9.93\u00a0s performance, was partly in [0]'s shadow as [0] had set an American record in the 200\u00a0m title, an event which Lewis had not entered earlier that year. [0] won the 200\u00a0m on June 19 at the TAC/Mobil Championships in 19.75 s, the second-fastest time in history and the low-altitude record, only 0.03\u00a0s behind Pietro Mennea's 1979 mark. Observers here noted that [0] probably could have broken the world record if [0] did not ease off in the final meters to raise [0]'s arms in celebration. Finally, [0] ran the anchor in the 4 \u00d7 100\u00a0m relay, winning in 37.86\u00a0s, a new world record and the first in [0]'s career.[0]'s year-best performances in the 100\u00a0m and long jump were not at the first World Championships, but at other meets. [0] became the first person to run a sub-10 second 100\u00a0m at low-altitude with a 9.97\u00a0s in Modesto on May 14. [0]'s gold at the first World Championships and [0]'s other fast times earned [0] the number one ranking in the world 1983, despite Calvin Smith who had earlier that year set a new world record in the 100\u00a0m at altitude with a 9.93\u00a0s performance,'s world record. At the TAC/Mobil Championships on June 19, [0] set a new low-altitude record in the long jump, 8.79\u00a0m (28\u00a0ft 10\u00a0in) and earned the world number one ranking in the long jump, 8.79\u00a0m (28\u00a0ft 10\u00a0in). Track and Field News ranked [0] number two in the 200\u00a0m, despite [0]'s low-altitude record of 19.75\u00a0s, behind Calvin Smith who had earlier that year set a new world record in the 100\u00a0m at altitude with a 9.93\u00a0s performance,. [0] was again named Athlete of the Year by Track and Field News.", "1984 Summer Olympics: emulating Jesse Owens": "[0] is our person to focus on. At the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, [0] was entered into four events with realistic prospects of winning each of four events and thereby matching the achievement of Jesse Owens at the 1936 Games in Berlin.[0] started [0]'s quest to match Jesse Owens with a convincing win in the 100\u00a0m, running 9.99\u00a0s to defeat [0]'s nearest competitor, fellow American Sam Graddy, by 0.2\u00a0s. In his next event, the long jump, [0] won with relative ease. [0]'s behavior in winning his next event, the long jump, stoked controversy, even as knowledgeable observers agreed that [0]'s tactics were correct. Since [0] still had heats and finals in the 200\u00a0m and the 4 \u00d7 100\u00a0m relay to compete in, [0] chose to take as few jumps as necessary to win his next event, the long jump,. [0] risked injury in the cool conditions of the day if [0] over-extended [0], and [0]'s ultimate goal to win four golds might be at risk. [0] knew that [0]'s first jump at 8.54\u00a0m (28\u00a0ft 0\u00a0in) was sufficient to win his next event, the long jump,. [0] fouled on [0]'s next jump and then passed on [0]'s remaining four allotted jumps. [0] easily won gold, and Gary Honey of Australia settled for the silver medal with a jump of 8.24\u00a0m (27\u00a0ft 1\u20444\u00a0in). The public was generally unaware of the intricacies of the sport and had been repeatedly told by the media of [0]'s quest to surpass Bob Beamon's legendary long jump record of 8.90\u00a0m (29\u00a0ft 2+1\u20444\u00a0in). [0] had often stated it was a goal of [0] to surpass Bob Beamon's legendary long jump record of 8.90\u00a0m (29\u00a0ft 2+1\u20444\u00a0in). A television advertisement with Bob Beamon's appeared before the final, featuring Bob Beamon's saying, \"Bob Beamon's hope [0] make it, [0].\" So, when [0] decided not to make any more attempts to try to break Bob Beamon's legendary long jump record of 8.90\u00a0m (29\u00a0ft 2+1\u20444\u00a0in), [0] was loudly booed. When asked about booed, [0] said, \"[0] was shocked at first. But after [0] thought about it, [0] realized that booed were booing because booed wanted to see more of [0]. [0] guess booing's flattering.\"His third gold medal came in the 200\u00a0m, where [0] won with a time of 19.80\u00a0s, a new Olympic record and the third fastest time in history. Finally, [0] won [0]'s fourth gold in the 4 \u00d7 100\u00a0m relay when [0] anchored the final leg of the 4 \u00d7 100\u00a0m relay; [0] broke the tape with a time of 37.83\u00a0s, setting a new world record.Although [0] had achieved what [0] had set out to do, matching Jesse Owens' feat of winning four gold medals in the same events at a single Olympic Games, [0] did not receive the lucrative endorsement offers that [0] had expected. The long jump controversy was one reason and [0]'s self-congratulatory conduct did not impress several other track stars: \"[0] rubs it in too much\", said Edwin Moses, twice Olympic gold medalist in the 400\u00a0m hurdles. \"A little humility is in order. A little humility's what [0] lacks.\" Further, Lewis's agent Joe Douglas compared [0] to pop star Michael Jackson, a comparison which did not go over well. Lewis's agent Joe Douglas said Lewis's agent Joe Douglas was inaccurately quoted, but the impression that [0] was aloof and egotistical was firmly planted in the public's perception by the end of the 1984 Olympic Games.Additionally, rumors circulated at that time that [0] was gay, and though [0] denied rumors, rumors probably hurt [0]'s marketability as well. [0]'s physical appearance at the 1984 Olympic Games, with a flattop haircut and flamboyant clothing, added fuel to rumors. \"It doesn't matter what [0]'s sexuality is\", high jumper Dwight Stones said. \"Madison Avenue perceives [0] as homosexual.\" Coca-Cola had offered a lucrative deal to [0] before the 1984 Olympic Games, but [0] and Lewis's agent Joe Douglas turned a lucrative deal down, confident that [0] would be worth more after the 1984 Olympic Games. But Coca-Cola rescinded a lucrative deal after the 1984 Olympic Games. Nike already had [0] under contract for several years, despite questions about how contract affected [0]'s amateur status, and [0] was appearing in Nike television advertisements in print and on billboards. Nike was faced with [0]'s new negative image and dropped [0] after the 1984 Olympic Games. \"If you're a male athlete, I think the American public wants you to look macho\", said I. \"Nike started looking for ways to get rid of [0]\", [0] said. \"Everyone there was so scared and so cynical Everyone there did not know what to do.\" [0] and Nike eventually did split, and [0] signed an endorsement deal with Mizuno. [0] would lay the blame on some inaccurate reporting, especially the \"[0] bashing\", as [0] put it, typified by a Sports Illustrated article before the 1984 Olympic Games.At year's end, [0] was again awarded the top rankings in the 100\u00a0m and the long jump and was additionally ranked number one in the 200\u00a0m, and for the third year in a row [0] was awarded the Athlete of the Year title by Track & Field News.The Chicago Bulls drafted [0] in the 1984 NBA draft as the 208th overall pick, although [0] had played neither high school nor college basketball. [0] never played in NBA. A poll on NBA's website ranked [0] second to Lusia Harris, the only woman to be drafted by NBA, as the most unusual pick in the history of the 1984 NBA draft. Ron Weiss, the head West Coast scout of The Chicago Bulls, and Ken Passon, the assistant West Coast scout, recommended [0] because [0] was the best athlete available. Similarly, [0] was drafted by the Dallas Cowboys as a wide receiver in the 12th round of the 1984 NFL Draft, even though [0] did not play football in college. [0] never played in NFL either.", "Ben Johnson and the 1987 World Championships": "[0] is our person to focus on. After the 1984 Olympics, [0] continued to dominate track and field, especially in the long jump, in which [0] would remain undefeated for the next seven years, but others started to challenge [0]'s dominance in the 100\u00a0m sprint. [0]'s low-altitude record had been surpassed by fellow American Mel Lattany with a time of 9.96\u00a0s shortly before the 1984 Olympics, but [0]'s biggest challenger would prove to be Canadian Ben Johnson, the bronze medalist behind Lewis at the 1984 Olympics. Canadian Ben Johnson, the bronze medalist behind Lewis at the 1984 Olympics would beat [0] once in 1985, but [0] also lost to others, while winning most of [0]'s races. [0] retained [0]'s number one rank 1985; Canadian Ben Johnson, the bronze medalist behind Lewis at the 1984 Olympics would place second. In 1986, Canadian Ben Johnson, the bronze medalist behind Lewis at the 1984 Olympics defeated [0] convincingly at the Goodwill Games in Moscow, clocking a new low-altitude record of 9.95\u00a0s. At 1986's end, Canadian Ben Johnson, the bronze medalist behind Lewis at the 1984 Olympics was ranked number one, while [0] slipped to number three, having lost more races than [0] won. [0] even seemed vulnerable in the long jump, an event [0] did not lose in 1986, or the year before, though [0] competed sparingly. [0] ended up ranked second behind Soviet Robert Emmiyan, who had the longest legal jump of the year at 8.61\u00a0m (28\u00a0ft 2+3\u20444\u00a0in).At the 1987 World Championships in Athletics in Rome, [0] skipped the 200\u00a0m to focus on [0]'s strongest event, the long jump, and made sure to take all [0]'s attempts. made was not to answer critics from the 1984 long jump controversy; made was because history's second 29\u00a0ft long-jumper was in the field: Soviet Robert Emmiyan, who had the longest legal jump of the year at 8.61\u00a0m (28\u00a0ft 2+3\u20444\u00a0in).At leapt 8.86\u00a0m (29\u00a0ft 3\u20444\u00a0in) at altitude in May, just 4\u00a0cm short of Bob Beamon's record. But Soviet Robert Emmiyan, who had the longest legal jump of the year at 8.61\u00a0m (28\u00a0ft 2+3\u20444\u00a0in).At's best that day was a leap of 8.53\u00a0m (27\u00a0ft 11+3\u20444\u00a0in), second to [0]'s 8.67\u00a0m (28\u00a0ft 5+1\u20444\u00a0in). [0] cleared 8.60\u00a0m (28\u00a0ft 2+1\u20442\u00a0in) four times. In the 4 \u00d7 100\u00a0m relay, [0] anchored the gold-medal team to a time of 37.90\u00a0s, the third-fastest of all time.The 100\u00a0m final was the most talked about event and caused the most drama. Canadian Ben Johnson, the bronze medalist behind Lewis at the 1984 Olympics had run under 10.00 s three times in the year before Rome, while [0] had not managed to get under the 10.00 s barrier at all. [0] looked strong in the heats of the 100\u00a0m, setting a Championship record in the semi-final while running into a wind with a 10.03 s effort. In The 100\u00a0m final, however, Canadian Ben Johnson, the bronze medalist behind Lewis at the 1984 Olympics won with a time that stunned observers: 9.83 s, a new world record. [0], had tied the existing world record, but tied was insufficient.While Canadian Ben Johnson, the bronze medalist behind Lewis at the 1984 Olympics basked in the glory of Canadian Ben Johnson, the bronze medalist behind Lewis at the 1984 Olympics's achievement, [0] started to explain away [0]'s . [0] first claimed that Canadian Ben Johnson, the bronze medalist behind Lewis at the 1984 Olympics had false-started, then [0] alluded to a stomach virus that had weakened [0], and finally, without naming names, said \"There are a lot of people coming out of nowhere. [0] don't think a lot of people coming out of nowhere are doing it without drugs.\" [0] added, \"[0] could run 9.8 or faster in the 100\u00a0m if [0] could jump into drugs right away.\" This was the start of [0]'s calling on the sport of track and field to eliminate the illegal use of performance-enhancing drugs. [0]'s detractors noted that the illegal use of performance-enhancing drugs had been in the sport of track and field for many years, and the illegal use of performance-enhancing drugs only became a cause for [0] once [0] was actually defeated. In response to the accusations, Canadian Ben Johnson, the bronze medalist behind Lewis at the 1984 Olympics replied \"When [0] was winning everything, Canadian Ben Johnson, the bronze medalist behind Lewis at the 1984 Olympics never said a word against [0]. And when the next guy comes along and beats Canadian Ben Johnson, the bronze medalist behind Lewis at the 1984 Olympics, Canadian Ben Johnson, the bronze medalist behind Lewis at the 1984 Olympics won't complain about beats either\".", "1988 Summer Olympics": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] not only lost the most publicized showdown in track and field in 1987, [0] also lost his father. When his father died of cancer at age 60, [0] placed the gold medal [0] won for the 100\u00a0m in 1984 in [0]'s hand to be buried with his father. \"Don't worry\", [0] told [0]'s mother. \"[0]'ll get another one.\" [0] repeatedly referred to his father as a motivating factor for the 1988 season. \"A lot happened to [0] last year, diedhis father. died caused [0] to re-educate [0] to being the very best [0] possibly can be this season\", [0] said, after defeating Johnson in Z\u00fcrich on August 17.The 100\u00a0m final at the 1988 Summer Olympics was one of the most sensational sports stories of the year and the 1988 Summer Olympics's unexpected outcome would rank as one of the most infamous sports stories of the century. Johnson won in 9.79 s, a new world record, while [0] set a new American record with 9.92 s. Three days later, Johnson tested positive for steroids, Johnson's medal was taken away and [0] was awarded gold and credited with a new Olympic record.In the long jump, Robert Emmiyan withdrew from the 1988 Summer Olympics citing an injury, and [0]'s main challengers were rising American long jump star Mike Powell and long-time rival Larry Myricks. [0] leapt 8.72\u00a0m (28\u00a0ft 7+1\u20444\u00a0in), a low-altitude Olympic best, and none of [0]'s competitors could match 8.72\u00a0m (28\u00a0ft 7+1\u20444\u00a0in), a low-altitude Olympic best. The Americans swept the medals in the long jump for the first time in 84 years. In the 200\u00a0m, [0] dipped under [0]'s Olympic record from 1984, running 19.79 s, but did so in second place to Joe DeLoach, who claimed the new record and Olympic gold in 19.75 s. In the final event [0] entered, the 4 \u00d7 100\u00a0m relay, [0] never made it to the track as the Americans fumbled an exchange in a heat and were disqualified.A subsequent honor would follow: [0] eventually was credited with the 100\u00a0m world record for the 9.92 s [0] ran in Seoul. Though Johnson's 9.79 s time was never ratified as a world record, the 9.83 s Johnson ran the year before was. However, in the fallout to the steroid scandal, an inquiry was called in Canada wherein Johnson admitted under oath to long-time steroid use. The IAAF subsequently stripped Johnson of Johnson's record and gold medal from the World Championships. [0] was deemed to be the world record holder for [0]'s 1988 Olympic performance and declared the 1987 100\u00a0m World Champion. The IAAF also declared that [0] had also, therefore, twice tied the \"true\" world record (9.93 s) for [0]'s 1987 World Championship performance, and again at the 1988 Z\u00fcrich meet where [0] defeated Johnson. However, those times were never ratified as records. From January 1, 1990, [0] was the world record holder in the 100\u00a0m. The record did not last long, as fellow American and University of Houston teammate Leroy Burrell ran 9.90 s on June 14, 1991, to break [0]'s mark. [0] also permanently lost [0]'s ranking as number one for the 200\u00a0m in 1988 and for the 100\u00a0m in 1989. [0] also lost the top ranking for the long jump in 1990 but was able to regain the top ranking for the long jump in 1992.", "1991 World Championships: Lewis' greatest performances": "[0] is our person to focus on. Tokyo was the venue for the 1991 World Championships. In the 100\u00a0m final, [0] faced the two men who ranked number one in the world the past two years: Burrell and Jamaican Raymond Stewart. In what would be the deepest 100\u00a0meters race ever to that time, with six men finishing in under ten seconds, [0] not only defeated [0]'s opponents, [0] reclaimed the world record with a clocking of 9.86 s. Though previously a world-record holder in this event, this was the first time [0] had crossed the line with \"WR\" beside [0]'s name on the giant television screens, and the first time [0] could savor [0]'s at the moment reclaimed occurred. [0] could be seen with tears in [0]'s eyes afterwards. \"The best race of my life\", [0] said. \"The best technique, the fastest. And [0] did reclaimed at thirty.\" the world record would stand for nearly three years. [0] also anchored the 4 \u00d7 100\u00a0m relay team to another world record, 37.50 s, the third time that year [0] had anchored a 4 \u00d7 100\u00a0m squad to a world record.the 1991 World Championships are perhaps best remembered for the long jump final, considered by some to have been one of the greatest competitions ever in any sport. [0] was up against [0]'s main rival of the last few years, Mike Powell, the silver medalist in the event from the 1988 Olympics and the top-ranked long jumper of 1990. [0] had at that point not lost a long jump competition in a decade, winning the 65 consecutive meets in which [0] competed. Mike Powell, the silver medalist in the event from the 1988 Olympics and the top-ranked long jumper of 1990 had been unable to defeat [0], despite sometimes putting in jumps near world-record territory, only to see jumps near world-record territory ruled fouls or, as with other competitors such as Larry Myricks, putting in leaps that [0] had only rarely surpassed, only to see [0] surpass them on [0]'s next or final attempt.Lewis' first jump was 8.68\u00a0m (28\u00a0ft 5+1\u20442\u00a0in), a World Championship record, and a mark bested by only three others beside [0] all-time. Mike Powell, the silver medalist in the event from the 1988 Olympics and the top-ranked long jumper of 1990, jumping first, had faltered in the first round, but jumped 8.54\u00a0m (28\u00a0ft 0\u00a0in) to claim second place in the second round. [0] jumped 8.83\u00a0m (28\u00a0ft 11+1\u20442\u00a0in), a wind-aided leap, in the third round, a mark that would have won all but two long jump competitions in history. Mike Powell, the silver medalist in the event from the 1988 Olympics and the top-ranked long jumper of 1990 responded with a long foul, estimated to be around 8.80\u00a0m (28\u00a0ft 10+1\u20444\u00a0in). Lewis's next jump made history: the first leap ever beyond Bob Beamon's record. The wind gauge indicated Lewis's next jump was wind-aided, so Lewis's next jump could not be considered a record, but Lewis's next jump would still count in the 1991 World Championships. 8.91\u00a0m (29\u00a0ft 2+3\u20444\u00a0in) was the greatest leap ever under any condition.In the next round, Mike Powell, the silver medalist in the event from the 1988 Olympics and the top-ranked long jumper of 1990 responded. Mike Powell, the silver medalist in the event from the 1988 Olympics and the top-ranked long jumper of 1990's was measured as 8.95\u00a0m (29\u00a0ft 4+1\u20444\u00a0in); this time, Mike Powell, the silver medalist in the event from the 1988 Olympics and the top-ranked long jumper of 1990's was not a foul, and with a wind gauge measurement of 0.3\u00a0m/s, well within the legal allowable for a record. Mike Powell, the silver medalist in the event from the 1988 Olympics and the top-ranked long jumper of 1990 had not only jumped 4\u00a0cm further than [0], Mike Powell, the silver medalist in the event from the 1988 Olympics and the top-ranked long jumper of 1990 had eclipsed Bob Beamon's record and done so at low altitude. [0] still had two jumps left, although [0] was now no longer chasing Bob Beamon's, but Mike Powell, the silver medalist in the event from the 1988 Olympics and the top-ranked long jumper of 1990. [0] leaped 8.87\u00a0m (29\u00a0ft 1\u00a0in), which was a new personal best under legal wind conditions, then a final jump of 8.84\u00a0m (29\u00a0ft 0\u00a0in). [0] thus lost [0]'s first long jump competition in a decade. Mike Powell, the silver medalist in the event from the 1988 Olympics and the top-ranked long jumper of 1990's and [0]'s final two jumps still stand as of May 2021 as the top three low altitude jumps ever. The farthest anyone has jumped since under legal conditions is 8.74\u00a0m (28\u00a0ft 8\u00a0in).Lewis' reaction to what was one of the greatest competitions ever in the sport was to offer acknowledgment of the achievement of Mike Powell, the silver medalist in the event from the 1988 Olympics and the top-ranked long jumper of 1990. \"Mike Powell, the silver medalist in the event from the 1988 Olympics and the top-ranked long jumper of 1990 just did reclaimed\", [0] said of Mike Powell, the silver medalist in the event from the 1988 Olympics and the top-ranked long jumper of 1990's . \"Lewis' first jump was that close, and Lewis' first jump was the best of Mike Powell, the silver medalist in the event from the 1988 Olympics and the top-ranked long jumper of 1990's .\" Mike Powell, the silver medalist in the event from the 1988 Olympics and the top-ranked long jumper of 1990 did jump as far or farther on two subsequent occasions, though two subsequent occasions were wind-aided jumps at altitude: 8.99\u00a0m (29\u00a0ft 5+3\u20444\u00a0in) in 1992 and 8.95\u00a0m (29\u00a0ft 4+1\u20444\u00a0in) in 1994. [0]'s best subsequent results were two wind-aided leaps at 8.72\u00a0m (28\u00a0ft 7+1\u20444\u00a0in), and an 8.68\u00a0m (28\u00a0ft 5+1\u20442\u00a0in) under legal conditions while in the qualifying rounds at the Barcelona Olympics.In reference to [0]'s efforts at the 1991 World Championships, [0] said, \"the 1991 World Championships has been the greatest meet that [0]'ve ever had.\" Track and Field News was prepared to go even further than that, suggesting that after the 1991 World Championships, \"It had become hard to argue that [0] is not the greatest athlete ever to set foot on track or field.\" [0]'s 1991 outstanding results earned [0] the ABC's Wide World of Sports Athlete of the Year, an award [0] shared with gymnastics star Kim Zmeskal.", "Final years and retirement": "[0] is our person to focus on. After the heights reached in 1991, [0] started to lose [0]'s dominance in both the sprints and the long jump. Though [0] anchored a world record 1:19.11 in the rarely run 4 \u00d7 200\u00a0m relay with the Santa Monica Track Club early in 1992, [0] failed to qualify for the Olympic team in the 100\u00a0m or 200\u00a0m. In the latter race, [0] finished fourth at the Olympic trials behind rising star Michael Johnson who set a personal best of 19.79 s. It was the first time the two had ever met on the track. [0] did, however, qualify for the long jump, finishing second behind Powell, and was eligible for the Olympic team. At the Games in Barcelona, [0] jumped 8.67\u00a0m (28\u00a0ft 5+1\u20444\u00a0in) in the first round of the long jump, beating Powell. In the Olympic team, [0] anchored another world record, in 37.40 s, a time which stood for 16 years. [0] covered the final leg in 8.85 seconds, the fastest officially recorded anchor leg.[0] competed at the 4th World Championships in Stuttgart in 1993, but finished fourth in the 100\u00a0m, and did not compete in the long jump. [0] did, however, earn his first World Championship medal in the 200\u00a0m, a bronze with [0]'s 19.99 s performance. his first World Championship medal in the 200\u00a0m, a bronze would prove to be [0]'s final Olympic or World Championship medal in a running event. Injuries kept [0] largely sidelined for the next few years, then [0] made a comeback for the 1996 season.In 1996, [0] qualified for the Olympic team in the long jump for the fifth time, the first time an American man has done so. At 1996, injuries to world-record holder Mike Powell and the leading long-jumper in the world, Iv\u00e1n Pedroso, affected world-record holder Mike Powell and the leading long-jumper in the world, Iv\u00e1n Pedroso,'s performances. [0], on the other hand, was in good form. Though [0] did not match past performances, [0]'s third-round leap of 8.50\u00a0m (27\u00a0ft 10+1\u20442\u00a0in) won gold by 0.21\u00a0m (8+1\u20444\u00a0in) over second-place finisher James Beckford of Jamaica. [0] became the third Olympian to win the same individual event four times, joining Danish sailor Paul Elvstr\u00f8m and American discus thrower Al Oerter; Danish sailor Paul Elvstr\u00f8m and American discus thrower Al Oerter would be joined by American swimmer Michael Phelps in 2016. [0]'s nine gold medals also tie [0] for second on the list of multiple Olympic gold medalists with Paavo Nurmi, Larisa Latynina, and Mark Spitz behind American swimmer Michael Phelps.Lewis' 8.50\u00a0m (27\u00a0ft 10+1\u20442\u00a0in) jump was also officially declared tied with Larry Myricks for the masters record for the 35\u201339 age group.Controversy struck when, as Track and Field News put it, \"[0]'s attitude in the whole relay hoo-hah a few days later served only to take the luster off [0]'s final gold.\" After Lewis' 8.50\u00a0m (27\u00a0ft 10+1\u20442\u00a0in) jump, it was noted that [0] could become the athlete with the most Olympic gold medals if [0] entered the Olympic team. Any member of the American Olympic men's track and field team could be used, even if Any member of the American Olympic men's track and field team had not qualified for the relay event. [0] said, \"If the American Olympic men's track and field team asked [0], [0]'d run it in a second. But the American Olympic men's track and field team haven't asked [0] to run it.\" [0] further suggested on Larry King Live that viewers phone the United States Olympic Committee to weigh in on the situation. [0] had skipped the mandatory relay training camp and demanded to run the anchor leg, which added to the debate. The final decision was to exclude [0] from the American Olympic men's track and field team. Olympic team coach Erv Hunt said, \"The basis of their [the relay team's's] opinion was 'their [the relay team's want to run, their [the relay team's worked their [the relay team's's butts off and their [the relay team's deserve to be here.'\" the American Olympic men's track and field team finished second behind Canada.[0] retired from track and field in 1997.", "": ""}, "Use of stimulants": {"": "Carl Lewis is our person to focus on. In 2003, Wade Exum, the United States Olympic Committee's director of drug control administration from 1991 to 2000, gave copies of documents to Sports Illustrated that revealed that some 100 American athletes had failed drug tests from 1988 to 2000, arguing that some 100 American athletes should have been prevented from competing in the Olympics but were nevertheless cleared to compete. Before showing copies of documents to Sports Illustrated that revealed that some 100 American athletes had failed drug tests from 1988 to 2000 to Sports Illustrated, Wade Exum, the United States Olympic Committee's director of drug control administration from 1991 to 2000, tried to use copies of documents to Sports Illustrated that revealed that some 100 American athletes had failed drug tests from 1988 to 2000 in a lawsuit against the United States Olympic Committee's, accusing the United States Olympic Committee's of racial discrimination and wrongful termination against Wade Exum, the United States Olympic Committee's director of drug control administration from 1991 to 2000, and cover-up over failed. Wade Exum, the United States Olympic Committee's director of drug control administration from 1991 to 2000,'s was summarily dismissed by the Denver federal Court for lack of evidence. the United States Olympic Committee's claimed Wade Exum, the United States Olympic Committee's director of drug control administration from 1991 to 2000,'s \"baseless\" as Wade Exum, the United States Olympic Committee's director of drug control administration from 1991 to 2000, Wade Exum, the United States Olympic Committee's director of drug control administration from 1991 to 2000, was the one in charge of screening the anti-doping test program of the United States Olympic Committee's and clarifying that some 100 American athletes were cleared according to the rules.Carl Lewis was among some 100 American athletes and copies of documents to Sports Illustrated that revealed that some 100 American athletes had failed drug tests from 1988 to 2000 revealed that at the 1988 Olympics trials Carl Lewis had three positive results on a combined test for pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine. pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine were and are banned in sport due to pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine's activity as stimulants, though at the time pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine were available over-the-counter as dietary supplements or treatments for cold and allergy symptoms. The combined concentrations of pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine detected in a combined test for pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine were 2 ppm, 4 ppm and 6 ppm.Carl Lewis defended Carl Lewis, claiming that Carl Lewis had accidentally consumed pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine. After the supplements that Carl Lewis had taken were analyzed to prove his claims, the United States Olympic Committee's accepted his claims, since a dietary supplement Carl Lewis ingested was found to contain ma huang, the Chinese name for Ephedra sinica, an ephedrine-bearing plant which was then marketed as a weight loss aid. Fellow Santa Monica Track Club teammates Joe DeLoach and Floyd Heard were also found to have pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine in Fellow Santa Monica Track Club teammates Joe DeLoach and Floyd Heard's systems, and were cleared to compete for the same reason.The highest level of the stimulants Carl Lewis recorded was 6 ppm, which was regarded as a positive test in 1988 but is now regarded as negative test. The acceptable level has been raised to ten parts per million for ephedrine and twenty-five parts per million for other substances. According to the the United States Olympic Committee's rules at the time, positive tests with levels lower than 10 ppm were cause of further investigation but not immediate ban. Neal Benowitz, a professor of medicine at UC San Francisco who is an expert on ephedrine and other stimulants, agreed in 2003 that \"These [levels] are what you'd see from someone taking cold or allergy medicines and are unlikely to have any effect on performance.\"Following Wade Exum, the United States Olympic Committee's director of drug control administration from 1991 to 2000,'s revelations the IAAF affirmed that at the 1988 Olympics trials the United States Olympic Committee's indeed followed the correct procedures in dealing with eight positive findings for ephedrine and ephedrine-related compounds in low concentration. the IAAF also reviewed in 1988 the relevant documents with some 100 American athletes's names undisclosed and stated that \"the medical committee felt satisfied, however, on the basis of the information received that the cases had been properly concluded by the United States Olympic Committee's as 'negative cases' in accordance with the rules and regulations in place at the time and no further action was taken\".Carl Lewis did nothing wrong. There was never intent. Carl Lewis was never told 'Carl Lewis violated the rules,'\" said Martin D. Singer, Carl Lewis's lawyer, who also said that Carl Lewis had inadvertently taken pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine in an over-the-counter herbal remedy. In an April 2003 interview, Carl Lewis agreed that Carl Lewis tested positive three times in 1988 but Carl Lewis was let off as tested was the normal practice in those times. \"The only thing Carl Lewis can say is Carl Lewis think it's unfortunate what Wade Exum, the United States Olympic Committee's director of drug control administration from 1991 to 2000, is trying to do\", said Carl Lewis. \"Carl Lewis don't know what people are trying to make out of nothing because everyone was treated the same, so what are we talking about?
