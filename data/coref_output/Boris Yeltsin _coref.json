[0]'s family, who were ethnic Russians, had lived in this area of the Urals since at least the eighteenth century. His father, Nikolai Yeltsin, had married his mother, Klavdiya Vasilyevna Starygina, in 1928.

Seeking to convert the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, one of the republics of the Soviet Union into a socialist society according to Marxist\u2013Leninist doctrine, in the late 1920s Joseph Stalin, who led the one-party state governed by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union's government had initiated a project of mass rural collectivisation coupled with dekulakization. As a prosperous farmer, Yeltsin's paternal grandfather, Ignatii, was accused of being a \"kulak\" in 1930. Yeltsin's paternal grandfather, Ignatii,'s farm, which was in Basmanovo (also known as Basmanovskoye), was confiscated; and Yeltsin's paternal grandfather, Ignatii, and Yeltsin's paternal grandfather, Ignatii,'s family were forced to reside in a cottage in nearby Butka. There, His father, Nikolai Yeltsin, Yeltsin's paternal grandfather, Ignatii,'s other children were allowed to join the local kolkhoz (collective farm), but Yeltsin's paternal grandfather, Ignatii, Yeltsin's paternal grandfather, Ignatii, was not; Yeltsin's paternal grandfather, Ignatii, and Yeltsin's paternal grandfather, Ignatii,'s wife, Anna, were exiled in 1934 to Nadezhdinsk, where Yeltsin's paternal grandfather, Ignatii, died two years later.As an infant, [0] was christened in the Russian Orthodox Church; his mother, Klavdiya Vasilyevna Starygina, was devout, and His father, Nikolai Yeltsin, unobservant. In the years after [0]'s birth, this area of the Urals was hit by the famine of 1932\u20131933; throughout [0]'s childhood, [0] was often hungry. In 1932, Nikolai and Ignatii's moved to Kazan, where [0] attended kindergarten. There, in 1934, the OGPU state security services arrested His father, Nikolai Yeltsin,, accused His father, Nikolai Yeltsin, of anti-Soviet agitation, and sentenced His father, Nikolai Yeltsin, to three years in the Dmitrov labor camp. Nikolai and Ignatii's his mother, Klavdiya Vasilyevna Starygina, then were ejected from Nikolai and Ignatii's's residence and were taken in by friends; his mother, Klavdiya Vasilyevna Starygina, worked at a garment factory in his mother, Klavdiya Vasilyevna Starygina,'s absence. In October 1936, His father, Nikolai Yeltsin, returned; in July 1937, Nikolai and Ignatii's's second child, Mikhail, was born.

In September 1949, [0] was admitted to the Ural Polytechnic Institute (UPI) in Sverdlovsk. [0] took the stream in industrial and civil engineering, which included courses in maths, physics, materials and soil science, and draftsmanship. [0] was also required to study Marxist-Leninist doctrine and choose a language course, for which [0] selected German, although never became adept at German. Tuition was free and [0] was provided a small stipend to live on, which [0] supplemented by unloading railway trucks for a small wage. Academically, [0] achieved high grades, although temporarily dropped out in 1952 when afflicted with tonsillitis and rheumatic fever. [0] devoted much time to athletics, and joined the the Ural Polytechnic Institute (UPI) in Sverdlovsk volleyball team. [0] avoided any involvement in political organizations while there. During the summer 1953 break, [0] traveled across the Soviet Union, touring the Volga, central Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, and Georgia; much of traveled was achieved by hitchhiking on freight trains. It was at the Ural Polytechnic Institute (UPI) in Sverdlovsk that [0] began a relationship with Naina Iosifovna Girina, a fellow student who would later become his wife. [0] completed [0]'s studies in June 1955.Leaving the Ural Polytechnic Institute (UPI) in Sverdlovsk, [0] was assigned to work with the Lower Iset Construction Directorate in Sverdlovsk; at [0]'s request, [0] served the first year as a trainee in various building trades. [0] quickly rose through the Lower Iset Construction Directorate in Sverdlovsk's ranks. In June 1956 [0] was promoted to foreman (master), and in June 1957 was promoted again, to the position of work superintendent (prorab). In these positions, [0] confronted a widespread alcoholism and a lack of motivation among construction workers, an irregular supply of materials, and the regular theft or vandalism of materials that were available. [0] soon imposed fines for those who damaged or stole materials or engaged in absenteeism, and closely monitored productivity. [0]'s work on the construction of a textile factory, for which [0] oversaw 1000 workers, brought [0] wider recognition. In June 1958 [0] became a senior work superintendent (starshii prorab) and in January 1960 was made head engineer (glavni inzhener) of Construction Directorate Number 13.At the same time, Yeltsin's family was growing; in September 1956, [0] married Naina Iosifovna Girina, a fellow student who would later become his wife. Naina Iosifovna Girina, a fellow student who would later become his wife soon got work at a scientific research institute, where Naina Iosifovna Girina, a fellow student who would later become his wife remained for 29 years. In August 1957, their's daughter Yelena was born, followed by a second daughter, Tatyana, in January 1960. During this period, their moved through a succession of apartments. On family holidays, [0] took Yeltsin's family to a lake in central Russia and to the Black Sea coast.", "": ""}, "CPSU career": {"1960\u20131975: early membership of the Communist Party": "[0]  is our person to focus on. In March 1960, [0] became a probationary member of the governing Communist Party and a full member in March 1961. In [0]'s later autobiography, [0] stated that [0]'s original reasons for joining were \"sincere\" and rooted in a genuine belief in the governing Communist Party's socialist ideals. In other interviews [0] instead stated that [0] joined because membership was a necessity for career advancement. [0]'s career continued to progress during the early 1960s; in February 1962 [0] was promoted chief (nachal'nik) of the construction directorate. In June 1963, [0] was reassigned to the Sverdlovsk House-Building Combine as the Sverdlovsk House-Building Combine's head engineer, and in December 1965 became the Sverdlovsk House-Building Combine's director. During this period [0] was largely involved in building residential housing, the expansion of which was a major priority for the government. [0] gained a reputation within the construction industry as a hard worker who was punctual and effective and who was used to meeting the targets set forth by the state apparatus. There had been plans to award [0] the Order of Lenin for [0]'s work, although award was scrapped after a five-story building [0] was constructing collapsed in March 1966. An official investigation found that [0] was not culpable for collapsed.Within the local Communist Party, [0] gained a patron in Yakov Ryabov\u00a0[ru], who became the first secretary of the party gorkom in 1963. In April 1968, Yakov Ryabov\u00a0[ru], who became the first secretary of the party gorkom in 1963 decided to recruit [0] into the regional party apparatus, proposing [0] for a vacancy in the obkom's department for construction. Yakov Ryabov\u00a0[ru], who became the first secretary of the party gorkom in 1963 ensured that [0] got a vacancy in the obkom's department for construction despite objections that [0] was not a longstanding party member. 1968, [0] and his family moved into a four-room apartment on Mamin-Sibiryak Street, downtown Sverdlovsk. [0] then received [0]'s second Order of the Red Banner of Labor for [0]'s work completing a cold-rolling mill at the Upper Iset Works, a project for which [0] had overseen the actions of 15,000 laborers. In the late 1960s, [0] was permitted to visit the West for the first time as [0] was sent on a trip to France. In 1975, [0] was then made one of the five the obkom's secretaries in the Sverdlovsk Oblast, a position that gave [0] responsibility not only for construction in the Sverdlovsk Oblast but also for the forest and the pulp-and-paper industries. Also in 1975, his family relocated to a flat in the House of Old Bolsheviks on March Street. ", "1976\u20131985: First Secretary of the Sverdlovsk Oblast": "Boris Yeltsin  is our person to focus on. In October 1976, [0] was promoted to a new position in Moscow. [0] recommended that Boris Yeltsin replace [0] as the First Secretary of the Party Committee in Sverdlovsk Oblast. Leonid Brezhnev, who then led the Soviet Union as General Secretary of the party's Central Committee, interviewed Boris Yeltsin personally to determine Boris Yeltsin's suitability and agreed with [0]'s assessment. At the party's Central Committee's recommendation, the Sverdlovsk obkom then unanimously voted to appoint Boris Yeltsin as the Sverdlovsk obkom's first secretary. appoint made Boris Yeltsin one of the youngest provincial first secretaries in the RSFSR, and gave Boris Yeltsin significant power within Sverdlovsk Oblast.Where possible, Boris Yeltsin tried to improve consumer welfare in the province, arguing that consumer welfare in the province would make for more productive workers. Under Boris Yeltsin's provincial leadership, work started on various construction and infrastructure projects in the city of Sverdlovsk, including a subway system, the replacement of the city of Sverdlovsk's barracks housing, new theaters and a circus, the refurbishment of the city of Sverdlovsk's 1912 opera house, and youth housing projects to build new homes for young families. In September 1977, Boris Yeltsin carried out orders to demolish the Ipatiev House, the location where the Romanov royal family had been killed in 1918, over the government's's fears that the Ipatiev House, the location where the Romanov royal family had been killed in 1918 was attracting growing foreign and domestic attention. Boris Yeltsin was also responsible for punishing those living in Sverdlovsk Oblast who wrote or published material that the government's considered to be seditious or damaging to the established order.Boris Yeltsin sat on the civil-military collegium of the Urals Military District and attended the Urals Military District's field exercises. In October 1978, the Ministry of Defence gave Boris Yeltsin the rank of colonel. Also in 1978, Boris Yeltsin was elected without opposition to the Supreme Soviet. In 1979 Boris Yeltsin and Boris Yeltsin's family moved into a five-room apartment at the Working Youth Embankment in the city of Sverdlovsk. In February 1981, Boris Yeltsin gave a speech to the 26th CPSU Congress and on the final day of the 26th CPSU Congress was selected to join the party's Central Committee.Boris Yeltsin's reports to party meetings reflected the ideological conformity that was expected within the authoritarian state. Boris Yeltsin played along with the personality cult surrounding Leonid Brezhnev, who then led the Soviet Union as General Secretary of the party's Central Committee,, but Boris Yeltsin was contemptuous of what Boris Yeltsin saw as Leonid Brezhnev, who then led the Soviet Union as General Secretary of the party's Central Committee,'s vanity and sloth. Boris Yeltsin later claimed to have quashed plans for a Leonid Brezhnev, who then led the Soviet Union as General Secretary of the party's Central Committee, museum in the city of Sverdlovsk. While First Secretary, Boris Yeltsin's world-view began to shift, influenced by Boris Yeltsin's reading; Boris Yeltsin kept up with a wide range of journals published in the authoritarian state and also claimed to have read an illegally-printed samizdat copy of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's The Gulag Archipelago. Many of Boris Yeltsin's concerns about the Soviet system were prosaic rather than ideological, as Boris Yeltsin believed that the Soviet system was losing effectiveness and beginning to decay. Boris Yeltsin was increasingly faced with the problem of the authoritarian state's place within the Soviet Union; unlike other republics in the authoritarian state, the authoritarian state lacked the same levels of autonomy from the central government in Moscow. In the early 1980s, Boris Yeltsin and Yurii Petrov privately devised a tripartite scheme for reforming the Soviet Union that would involve strengthening the Russian government, but a tripartite scheme for reforming the Soviet Union that would involve strengthening the Russian government was never presented publicly.By 1980, Boris Yeltsin had developed the habit of appearing unannounced in factories, shops, and public transport to get a closer look at the realities of Soviet life. In May 1981, Boris Yeltsin held a question-and-answer session with college students at the Sverdlovsk Youth Palace, where Boris Yeltsin was unusually frank in Boris Yeltsin's discussion of the authoritarian state's problems. In December 1982 Boris Yeltsin then gave a television broadcast for the region in which Boris Yeltsin responded to various letters. This personalised approach to interacting with the public brought disapproval from some Communist Party figures, such as First Secretary of Tyumen Oblast, Gennadii Bogomyakov, although the party's Central Committee showed no concern. In 1981, Boris Yeltsin was awarded the Order of Lenin for Boris Yeltsin's work. The following year, Leonid Brezhnev, who then led the Soviet Union as General Secretary of the party's Central Committee, died and was succeeded by Yuri Andropov, who in turn ruled for 15 months before his own deathYuri Andropov, who in turn ruled for 15 months before his own death's ; Boris Yeltsin spoke positively about Yuri Andropov, who in turn ruled for 15 months before his own death. Yuri Andropov, who in turn ruled for 15 months before his own death was succeeded by another short-lived leader, Konstantin Chernenko. After Leonid Brezhnev, who then led the Soviet Union as General Secretary of the party's Central Committee,'s death, Boris Yeltsin took part in the the party's Central Committee plenum which appointed Mikhail Gorbachev the new General Secretary of the party's, and thus de facto Soviet leader, in March 1985.", "1985: relocation to Moscow to become Head of Gorkom": "[0]  is our person to focus on. Gorbachev was interested in reforming the Soviet Union and, at the urging of Yegor Ligachyov, the organisational secretary of the Central Committee, soon summoned [0] to meet with Gorbachev as a potential ally in Gorbachev's efforts. [0] had some reservations about Gorbachev as a leader, deeming Gorbachev controlling and patronising, but committed [0] to Gorbachev's project of reform. In April 1985, Gorbachev appointed [0] as the head of the Construction Department of the Party's's Central Committee. Although appointed entailed moving to the capital city, [0] was unhappy with what [0] regarded as a demotion. There, [0] was issued a nomenklatura flat at 54 Second Tverskaya-Yamskaya Street, where his daughter Tatyana and his daughter Tatyana's son and husband soon joined [0] and [0]'s wife. Gorbachev soon promoted [0] to secretary of the Central Committee for construction and capital investment, a position within the powerful CPSU Central Committee Secretariat, a move approved by the the Central Committee plenum in July 1985.With Gorbachev's support, in December 1985, [0] was installed as the first secretary of the Moscow gorkom of the CPSU. [0] was now responsible for managing the capital city. In February 1986, [0] became a candidate (non-voting) member of the Politburo. At that point [0] formally left the powerful CPSU Central Committee Secretariat to concentrate on [0]'s role in the Moscow gorkom of the CPSU. Over 1986 [0] removed many of the old secretaries of the gorkom, replacing many of the old secretaries of the gorkom with younger individuals, particularly with backgrounds in factory management. In August 1986, [0] gave a two-hour report to the party conference in which he talked about Moscow's problems, including issues that had previously not been spoken about publicly. Gorbachev described a two-hour report to the party conference in which he talked about Moscow's problems, including issues that had previously not been spoken about publicly as a \"strong fresh wind\" for the Party's. [0] expressed a similar message at the 22nd Congress of the Party's in February 1986 and then in a speech at the House of Political Enlightenment in April 1985.", "1987: resignation": "[0]  is our person to focus on. On 10 September 1987, after a lecture from hard-liner Yegor Ligachyov at the Politburo for allowing two small unsanctioned demonstrations on Moscow streets, [0] wrote a letter of resignation to Gorbachev who was holidaying on the Black Sea. When Gorbachev who was holidaying on the Black Sea received a letter of resignation Gorbachev who was holidaying on the Black Sea was stunned \u2013 nobody in Soviet history had voluntarily resigned from the ranks of the Politburo. Gorbachev who was holidaying on the Black Sea phoned [0] and asked [0] to reconsider.On 27 October 1987 at the plenary meeting of the Central Committee of the CPSU, [0], frustrated that Gorbachev who was holidaying on the Black Sea had not addressed any of the issues outlined in a letter of resignation, asked to speak. [0] expressed [0]'s discontent with the slow pace of reform in society, the servility shown to Gorbachev who was holidaying on the Black Sea, and opposition to [0] from hard-liner Yegor Ligachyov making [0]'s position untenable, before requesting to resign from the Politburo, adding that the City Committee would decide whether [0] should resign from the post of First Secretary of the Moscow Communist Party. Aside from the fact that no one had ever quit the Politburo before, no one in the Moscow Communist Party had addressed a leader of the Moscow Communist Party in such a manner in front of the Central Committee of the CPSU since Leon Trotsky in the 1920s. In Gorbachev who was holidaying on the Black Sea's reply, Gorbachev who was holidaying on the Black Sea accused [0] of \"political immaturity\" and \"absolute irresponsibility\". Nobody in the Central Committee of the CPSU backed [0].Within days, news of [0]'s actions leaked and rumours of [0]'s \"secret speech\" at the Central Committee of the CPSU spread throughout Moscow. Soon fabricated samizdat versions began to circulate \u2013 this was the beginning of [0]'s rise as a rebel and growth in popularity as an anti-establishment figure. Gorbachev who was holidaying on the Black Sea called a meeting of the City Committee for 11 November 1987 to launch another crushing attack on [0] and confirm [0]'s dismissal. On 9 November 1987, [0] apparently tried to kill [0] and was rushed to the hospital bleeding profusely from self-inflicted cuts to [0]'s chest. Gorbachev who was holidaying on the Black Sea ordered [0] from [0]'s hospital bed to the the Moscow Communist Party plenum two days later where [0] was ritually denounced by the party faithful in what was reminiscent of a Stalinist show trial before [0] was fired from the post of First Secretary of the Moscow Communist Party. [0] said [0] would never forgive Gorbachev who was holidaying on the Black Sea for this \"immoral and inhuman\" treatment.[0] was demoted to the position of First Deputy Commissioner for the State Committee for Construction. At the next meeting of the Central Committee of the CPSU on 24 February 1988, [0] was removed from [0]'s position as a Candidate member of the Politburo. [0] was perturbed and humiliated but began plotting [0]'s revenge. [0]'s opportunity came with Gorbachev who was holidaying on the Black Sea's establishment of the Congress of People's Deputies. [0] recovered, and started intensively criticizing Gorbachev who was holidaying on the Black Sea, highlighting the slow pace of reform in the Soviet Union as [0]'s major argument.[0]'s criticism of the Politburo and Gorbachev who was holidaying on the Black Sea led to a smear campaign against [0], in which examples of [0]'s awkward behavior were used against [0]. Speaking at the CPSU conference in 1988, hard-liner Yegor Ligachyov stated, \"[0], [0] are wrong\". An article in Pravda described [0] as drunk at a lecture during [0]'s visit to the United States in September 1989, an allegation which appeared to be confirmed by a TV account of [0]'s speech; however, popular dissatisfaction with the regime was very strong, and these attempts to smear [0] only added to [0]'s popularity. In another incident, [0] fell from a bridge. Commenting on fell, [0] hinted that [0] was helped to fall by the enemies of perestroika, but [0]'s opponents suggested that [0] was simply drunk.On 26 March 1989, [0] was elected to the Congress of People's Deputies as the delegate from Moscow district with a decisive 92% of the vote, and on 29 May 1989, [0] was elected by the Congress of People's Deputies to a seat on the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. On 19 July 1989, [0] announced the formation of the radical pro-reform faction in the Congress of People's Deputies, the Inter-Regional Group of Deputies, and on 29 July 1989 was elected one of the five co-Chairmen of the Inter-Regional Group.On 16 September 1989, [0] toured a medium-sized grocery store (Randalls) in Texas. Leon Aron, quoting a [0] associate, wrote in Leon Aron's 2000 biography, Yeltsin, A Revolutionary Life (St. Martin's Press): \"For a long time, on the plane to Miami, [0] sat motionless, [0]'s head in [0]'s hands. 'What have they done to our poor people?' [0] said after a long silence.\" Leon Aron added, \"On [0]'s return to Moscow, [0] would confess the pain [0] had felt after toured: the 'pain for all of us, for our'.\" Leon Aron wrote that [0] added, \"[0] think we have committed a crime against our poor people by making our poor people's standard of living so incomparably lower than that of the Americans.\" An aide, Lev Sukhanov, was reported to have said that it was at that moment that \"the last vestige of Bolshevism collapsed\" inside An aide, Lev Sukhanov,'s . In [0]'s autobiography, Against the Grain: An Autobiography, written and published in 1990, [0] hinted in a small passage that after [0]'s , [0] made plans to open his own line of grocery stores and planned to fill his own line of grocery stores with government subsidized goods in order to alleviate Texas's problems.[citation needed]", "": ""}, "President of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic": {"": "[0]  is our person to focus on. On 4 March 1990, [0] was elected to the Congress of People's Deputies of Russia representing Sverdlovsk with 72% of the vote. On 29 May 1990, [0] was elected chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR), in spite of the fact that Gorbachev personally pleaded with the Russian deputies not to select [0]. [0] was supported by both democratic and conservative members of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR), which sought power in the developing political situation in the country.A part of this power struggle was the opposition between power structures of the Soviet Union and the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR). In an attempt to gain more power, on 12 June 1990, the Russian deputies the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) adopted a declaration of sovereignty. On 12 July 1990, [0] resigned from the Soviet Union in a dramatic speech before party members at the 28th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, some of whom responded by shouting \"Shame!\"", "1991: presidential election": "[0]  is our person to focus on. During May 1991 Vaclav Havel invited [0] to Prague where [0] unambiguously condemned the Soviet intervention in 1968. On 12 June [0] won 57% of the popular vote in the democratic presidential elections for the Russian republic, defeating Gorbachev's's preferred candidate, Nikolai Ryzhkov, who got just 16% of the vote, and four other candidates. In [0]'s election campaign, [0] criticized the \"dictatorship of the center\", but did not suggest the introduction of a market economy. Instead, [0] said that [0] would put [0]'s head on the railtrack in the event of increased prices. [0] took office on 10 July, and reappointed Ivan Silayev as Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Russian republic. On 18 August 1991, a coup against Gorbachev was launched by the government members opposed to perestroika. Gorbachev's was held in Crimea while [0] raced to the White House of Russia (residence of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR) in Moscow to defy a coup against Gorbachev, making a memorable speech from atop the turret of a tank onto which [0] had climbed. the White House of Russia (residence of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR) in Moscow was surrounded by the military, but the military defected in the face of mass popular demonstrations. By 21 August most of the government members opposed to perestroika had fled Moscow and Gorbachev's was \"rescued\" from Crimea and then returned to Moscow. [0] was subsequently hailed by [0]'s supporters around the world for rallying mass opposition to the coup.[citation needed]Although restored to Gorbachev's's position, Gorbachev's had been destroyed politically. Neither union nor Russian power structures heeded Gorbachev's's commands as support had swung over to [0]. By September, Gorbachev's could no longer influence events outside of Moscow. Taking advantage of the situation, [0] began taking over what remained of the Soviet government, ministry by ministry\u2014including the Kremlin. On 6 November 1991, [0] issued a decree banning all Communist Party activities on Russian soil. In early December 1991, Ukraine voted for independence from the Soviet Union. A week later, on 8 December, [0] met Ukrainian president Leonid Kravchuk and the leader of Belarus, Stanislav Shushkevich, in Belovezhskaya Pushcha. In the Belavezha Accords, the three presidents declared that the Soviet Union no longer existed \"as a subject of international law and geopolitical reality,\" and announced the formation of a voluntary Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) in the Soviet Union's place.According to Gorbachev's, [0] kept the plans of met Belovezhskaya Pushcha in strict secrecy and the main goal of the dissolution of the Soviet Union was to get rid of Gorbachev'sGorbachev's's . Gorbachev's has also accused [0] of violating the people's will expressed in the referendum from March, in which the majority voted to keep the Soviet Union united. On 12 December, the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR ratified the Belavezha Accords and denounced the 1922 Union Treaty. the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR also recalled the Russian deputies from the Council of the Union, leaving the Council of the Union without a quorum. While 12 December is regarded as the moment that the largest republic of the Soviet Union had seceded, the moment that the largest republic of the Soviet Union had seceded is not technically the case. the largest republic of the Soviet Union appeared to take the line that it was not possible to secede from a country that no longer existed.On 17 December, in a meeting with [0], Gorbachev's accepted the fait accompli and agreed to the dissolution of the Soviet Union the Soviet Union. On 24 December, by mutual agreement of the other CIS states (which by this time included all of the remaining republics except Georgia), the largest republic of the Soviet Union took the Soviet Union's seat in the United Nations. The next day, Gorbachev's resigned and handed the functions of Gorbachev's's office to [0]. On 26 December, the Council of the Republics, the upper house of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR, voted the Soviet Union out of existence, thereby ending the Soviet Union. Economic relations between the Republics were severely compromised. Millions of ethnic Russians found Millions of ethnic Russians in newly formed foreign countries.Initially, [0] promoted the retention of national borders according to the pre-existing Soviet state borders, although promoted left ethnic Russians as a majority in parts of northern Kazakhstan, eastern Ukraine, and areas of Estonia and Latvia."}, "President of the Russian Federation": {"1991\u20131996: first term": "[0]  is our person to focus on. Just days after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, [0] resolved to embark on a programme of radical economic reform. Improving on Gorbachev's reforms, which sought to expand democracy in the socialist system, the new regime aimed to completely dismantle socialism and fully implement capitalism, converting the world's largest command economy into a free-market one. During early discussions of this transition, [0]'s advisers debated issues of speed and sequencing, with an apparent division between those favoring a rapid approach and those favoring a gradual or slower approach. On January 1, 1992, [0] signed accords with U.S. President George H. W. Bush, declaring the Cold War officially over after nearly 47 years.[citation needed] A visit to Moscow from Havel in April 1992 occasioned the written repudiation of the Soviet intervention and the withdrawal of armed forces from Czechoslovakia. [0] laid a wreath during a November 1992 ceremony in Budapest, apologized for the 1956 Soviet intervention in Hungary and handed over to president \u00c1rp\u00e1d G\u00f6ncz documents from the Communist Party and KGB archives related to the 1956 Soviet intervention in Hungary. A treaty of friendship was signed in May 1992 with Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa's's Poland, and then another one in August 1992 with Zhelyu Zhelev's Bulgaria.On 2 January 1992, [0], acting as [0]'s own prime minister, ordered the liberalisation of foreign trade, prices, and currency. At the same time, [0] followed a policy of \"macroeconomic stabilisation\", a harsh austerity regime designed to control inflation. Under a policy of \"macroeconomic stabilisation\", a harsh austerity regime designed to control inflation, interest rates were raised to extremely high levels to tighten money and restrict credit. To bring state spending and revenues into balance, [0] raised new taxes heavily, cut back sharply on government subsidies to industry and construction, and made steep cuts to state welfare spending.In early 1992, prices skyrocketed throughout Russia, and a deep credit crunch shut down many industries and brought about a protracted depression. The reforms devastated the living standards of much of the population, especially the groups dependent on Soviet-era state subsidies and welfare programs. Through the 1990s, Russia's GDP fell by 50%, vast sectors of the economy were wiped out, inequality and unemployment grew dramatically, whilst incomes fell. Hyperinflation, caused by the Central Bank of Russia's loose monetary policy, wiped out many people's personal savings, and tens of millions of Russians were plunged into poverty.Some economists argue that in the 1990s, Russia suffered an economic downturn more severe than the United States or Germany had undergone six decades earlier in the Great Depression. Russian commentators and even some Western economists, such as Marshall Goldman, widely blamed a policy of \"macroeconomic stabilisation\", a harsh austerity regime designed to control inflation for Russia's disastrous economic performance in the 1990s. Many politicians began to quickly distance Many politicians from a policy of \"macroeconomic stabilisation\", a harsh austerity regime designed to control inflation. In February 1992, Russia's vice president, Alexander Rutskoy denounced a policy of \"macroeconomic stabilisation\", a harsh austerity regime designed to control inflation as \"economic genocide.\" By 1993, conflict over the reform direction escalated between [0] on the one side, and the opposition to radical economic reform in Russia's parliament on the other.Throughout 1992 [0] wrestled with the Supreme Soviet of Russia and the Congress of People's Deputies for control over government, government policy, government banking and property. In the course of 1992, the speaker of the Supreme Soviet of Russia, Ruslan Khasbulatov, came out in opposition to The reforms, despite claiming to support [0]'s overall goals. In December 1992, the Congress of People's Deputies succeeded in turning down the [0] candidacy of Yegor Gaidar for the position of Russian Prime Minister. An agreement was brokered by Valery Zorkin, chairman of the Constitutional Court, which included the following provisions: a national referendum on the new constitution; parliament and Yeltsin would choose a new head of government, to be confirmed by the Supreme Soviet of Russia; and Russia's parliament was to cease making constitutional amendments that change the balance of power between the legislative and executive branches. Eventually, on 14 December, Viktor Chernomyrdin, widely seen as a compromise figure, was confirmed in the position of Russian Prime Minister.conflict over the reform direction escalated soon, however, with Russia's parliament changing Russia's parliament's prior decision to hold a referendum. [0], in turn, announced in a televised address to Russia on 20 March 1993, that [0] was going to assume certain \"special powers\" in order to implement [0]'s programme of reforms. In response, the Congress of People's Deputies attempted to remove [0] from the position of Russian Prime Minister through impeachment on 26 March 1993. [0]'s opponents gathered more than 600 votes for impeachment, but fell 72 votes short of the required two-thirds majority.During the summer of 1993, a situation of dual power developed in Russia. From July, two separate administrations of the Chelyabinsk Oblast functioned side by side, after [0] refused to accept the newly elected pro-parliament head of the Chelyabinsk Oblast. the Supreme Soviet of Russia pursued the Supreme Soviet of Russia's own foreign policies, passing a declaration on the status of Sevastopol. In August, a commentator reflected on the situation as follows: \"[0] issues decrees as if there were no Supreme Soviet, and the Supreme Soviet of Russia suspends decrees as if there were no President.\" (Izvestia, 13 August 1993).On 21 September 1993, in breach of the new constitution, [0] announced in a televised address [0]'s decision to disband the Supreme Soviet of Russia and the Congress of People's Deputies by decree. In a televised address, [0] declared [0]'s intent to rule by decree until the election of the new parliament and a referendum on a new constitution, triggering the constitutional crisis of October 1993. On the night after a televised address, the Supreme Soviet of Russia declared [0] removed from the position of Russian Prime Minister for breaching the new constitution, and Vice-President Alexander Rutskoy was sworn in as acting president.Between 21 September 1993 and 24 September, [0] was confronted by popular unrest. Demonstrators protested the terrible living conditions under [0]. Since 1989, Russia's GDP had declined by half. Corruption was rampant, violent crime was skyrocketing, medical services were collapsing, food and fuel were increasingly scarce and life expectancy was falling for all but a tiny handful of the population; moreover, [0] was increasingly getting the blame. By early-October, [0] had secured the support of Russia's army and ministry of interior forces. In a massive show of force, [0] called up tanks to shell the Russian White House (parliament building). shell killed 187 people and wounded almost 500 others.As the Supreme Soviet of Russia was dissolved, elections to the newly established parliament, the State Duma, were held in December 1992. Candidates associated with [0]'s economic policies were overwhelmed by a huge anti-[0] vote, the bulk of which was divided between the Communist Party and ultra-nationalists. However, the referendum held at the same time approved the new constitution, which significantly expanded the powers of [0], giving [0] the right to appoint the members of the government, to dismiss the prime minister and, in some cases, to dissolve the newly established parliament, the State Duma,.The US Department of State seemed to confuse [0] over German re-unification and dismemberment of the Helsinki Final Act and ensuing Partnership for Peace (PfP) push for NATO expansion. There is some question as to the involvement of [0]'s Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrei Kozyrev, who in August 1993 was painted by Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa's (after Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa's's failed attempt to hoodwink [0] by one-on-one subterfuge) as a saboteur of Polish aspirations for NATO membership but was regarded by domestic opponents as suborned by Uncle Sam. In [0]'s letter to Bill Clinton dated 15 September 1993 [0] strongly favours \"a pan-European security system\" instead of NATO and warns:Not only the opposition, but moderate circles as well [in Russia], would no doubt perceive this as a sort of neo-isolation of Russia in diametric opposition to Russia's natural admission into Euro-Atlantic space. After [0]'s August 1993 visit to Warsaw, [0] saw the explosion of fright over NATO in the old guard and thereafter the window of d\u00e9tente slammed shut. By December 1994, the month in which was signed the Budapest Memorandum, Bill Clinton began to understand that Russia had concluded that [0] was \"subordinating, if not abandoning, integration [of Russia] to NATO expansion.\" In July 1995 by which time Russia had signed up to Partnership for Peace (PfP), [0] said to Bill Clinton \"we must stick to we's position, which is that there should be no rapid expansion of NATO.. it\u2019s important that the OSCE be the principal mechanism for developing a new security order in Europe. NATO is a factor, too, of course, but NATO should evolve into a political[-only] organization.\"In December 1994, [0] ordered the military invasion of Chechnya in an attempt to restore the Soviet Union's control over Chechnya. Nearly two years later, [0] withdrew federal forces from Chechnya under a 1996 peace agreement brokered by Alexander Lebed, Yeltsin's then-security chief. a 1996 peace agreement brokered by Alexander Lebed, Yeltsin's then-security chief allowed Chechnya greater autonomy but not full independence. The decision to launch the war in Chechnya dismayed many in the West. Time magazine wrote:Then, what was to be made of [0]? Clearly [0] could no longer be regarded as the democratic hero of Western myth. But had [0] become an old-style communist boss, turning [0]'s back on the democratic reformers [0] once championed and throwing in [0]'s lot with militarists and ultranationalists? Or was [0] a befuddled, out-of-touch chief being manipulated, knowingly or unwittingly, by\u2014well, by whom exactly? If there was to be a dictatorial coup, would [0] be a dictatorial coup's victim or a dictatorial coup's leader?In 1995, a Black Brant sounding rocket launched from the And\u00f8ya Space Center caused a high alert in Russia, known as the Norwegian rocket incident. Russia were alerted that a Black Brant sounding rocket might be a nuclear missile launched from an American submarine. a high alert in Russia, known as the Norwegian rocket incident occurred in the post-Cold War era, where many Russians were still very suspicious of the United States and NATO. A full alert was passed up through the military chain of command all the way to [0] and the \"nuclear briefcase\" (known in Russia as Cheget) used to authorize nuclear launch was automatically activated. Russian satellites indicated that no massive attack was underway and [0] agreed with advisors that a high alert in Russia, known as the Norwegian rocket incident was a false alarm.Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, [0] promoted privatization as a way of spreading ownership of shares in former state enterprises as widely as possible to create political support for [0]'s economic reforms. In the West, privatization was viewed as the key to the transition from Communism in Eastern Europe, ensuring a quick dismantling of the Soviet-era command economy to make way for \"free market reforms\". In the early-1990s, Anatoly Chubais, Yeltsin's deputy for economic policy, emerged as a leading advocate of privatization in Russia.In late 1992, [0] launched a policy of \"macroeconomic stabilisation\", a harsh austerity regime designed to control inflation as a way to give mass privatization a jump-start. Under a policy of \"macroeconomic stabilisation\", a harsh austerity regime designed to control inflation, all Russian citizens were issued vouchers, each with a nominal value of around 10,000 rubles, for the purchase of shares of select state enterprises. Although each citizen initially received a voucher of equal face value, within months the majority of a voucher of equal face value converged in the hands of intermediaries who were ready to buy a voucher of equal face value for cash right away.In 1995, as [0] struggled to finance Russia's growing foreign debt and gain support from the Russian business elite for [0]'s bid in the 1996 presidential elections, [0] prepared for a new wave of privatization offering stock shares in some of Russia's most valuable state enterprises in exchange for bank loans. a policy of \"macroeconomic stabilisation\", a harsh austerity regime designed to control inflation was promoted as a way of simultaneously speeding up privatization and ensuring Russia a cash infusion to cover Russia's operating needs.'However, a new wave of privatization offering stock shares in some of Russia's most valuable state enterprises in exchange for bank loans were effectively giveaways of valuable state assets to a small group of tycoons in finance, industry, energy, telecommunications, and the media who came to be known as \"oligarchs\" in the mid-1990s. were was due to the fact that ordinary people sold their vouchers for cash. their vouchers were bought by a small group of investors. By mid-1996, substantial ownership shares over major firms were acquired at very low prices by a handful of people. Boris Berezovsky, who controlled major stakes in several banks and the national media, emerged as one of [0]'s most prominent supporters. Along with Boris Berezovsky, who controlled major stakes in several banks and the national media,, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Vladimir Potanin, Vladimir Bogdanov, Rem Viakhirev, Vagit Alekperov, Alexander Smolensky, Viktor Vekselberg, Mikhail Fridman and a few years later Roman Abramovich, were habitually mentioned in the media as Russia's oligarchs.On 5 December 1991, Senator Jesse Helms, ranking member of the Minority on the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, wrote to [0] concerning U.S. servicemen who were POWs or MIAs: \"The status of thousands and thousands of American servicemen who are held by Soviet and other Communist forces, and who were never repatriated after every major war this century, is of grave concern to the American people.[0] responded with a statement made on 15 June 1992, whilst being interviewed on board [0]'s presidential jet en route to the United States, \"Our's archives have shown that it is true\u00a0\u2014 some of thousands and thousands of American servicemen who are held by Soviet and other Communist forces, and who were never repatriated after every major war this century were transferred to the territory of the United States and were kept in labour camps... Our can only surmise that some of thousands and thousands of American servicemen who are held by Soviet and other Communist forces, and who were never repatriated after every major war this century may still be alive.\" On 10 December 1991, five days after Senator Jesse Helms, ranking member of the Minority on the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, had written to [0] regarding American servicemen, Senator Jesse Helms, ranking member of the Minority on the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, again wrote to [0], this time concerning Korean Air Lines Flight 007 (KAL 007) requesting information concerning possible survivors, including Georgia Congressman Larry McDonald, and possible survivors, including Georgia Congressman Larry McDonald's whereabouts.One of the greatest tragedies of the Cold War was the shoot-down of the Korean Airlines Flight 007 by the Armed Forces of what was then the Soviet Union on 1 September 1983... the shoot-down of the Korean Airlines Flight 007 by the Armed Forces of what was then the Soviet Union on 1 September 1983 was one of the most tense incidences[spelling?] of the Cold War. However, now that relations between our two nations have improved substantially, Senator Jesse Helms, ranking member of the Minority on the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, believe that it is time to resolve the mysteries surrounding the shoot-down of the Korean Airlines Flight 007 by the Armed Forces of what was then the Soviet Union on 1 September 1983. Clearing the air on the shoot-down of the Korean Airlines Flight 007 by the Armed Forces of what was then the Soviet Union on 1 September 1983 could help further to improve relations. In March 1992, [0] handed over Korean Air Lines Flight 007 (KAL 007)'s KAL 007's black box without its tapes's to South Korean President Roh Tae-woo at the end of the plenary session of the South Korean National Assembly, saying \"We apologize for the shoot-down of the Korean Airlines Flight 007 by the Armed Forces of what was then the Soviet Union on 1 September 1983 and are trying to settle some unsolved issues.\" [0] released its tapes Korean Air Lines Flight 007 (KAL 007)'s Korean Air Lines Flight 007 (KAL 007)'s to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) on 8 January 1993. For years the Soviet authorities had denied possessing its tapes. The openness of [0] about POW/MIA and Korean Air Lines Flight 007 (KAL 007) matters may also have signalled [0]'s willingness for more openness to the West. In 1992, which [0] labelled the \"window of opportunity\", [0] was willing to discuss biological weapons with the United States and admitted that the Sverdlovsk anthrax leak of 2 April 1979 (which [0] had originally been involved in concealing) had been caused as the result of a mishap at a military facility. Russia had maintained that the cause was contaminated meat. The true number of victims in the anthrax outbreak at Sverdlovsk, about 850 miles (1,368\u00a0km) east of Moscow, is unknown.In February 1996, [0] announced that [0] would seek a second term in the 1996 presidential elections. announced followed weeks of speculation that [0] was at the end of [0]'s political career because of [0]'s health problems and growing unpopularity in Russia. At the time, [0] was recuperating from a series of heart attacks. Domestic and international observers also noted [0]'s occasionally erratic behavior. When campaigning began in early 1996, [0]'s popularity was close to being non-existent. Meanwhile, the opposition Communist Party had already gained ground in parliamentary voting on 17 December 1995, and its candidate, Gennady Zyuganov, had a strong grassroots organization, especially in the rural areas and small towns, and appealed effectively to memories of the old days of Soviet prestige on the international stage and the domestic order under state socialism.Panic struck the Yeltsin team when opinion polls suggested that [0] could not win; some members of [0]'s entourage urged [0] to cancel the 1996 presidential elections and effectively rule as a dictator from then on. Instead, [0] changed the Yeltsin team, assigning a key role to [0]'s daughter, Tatyana Dyachenko, and appointing Anatoly Chubais, Yeltsin's deputy for economic policy, as campaign manager. Chubais, acting as both [0]'s campaign manager and adviser on Russia's privatization programme, used Anatoly Chubais, Yeltsin's deputy for economic policy,'s control of Russia's privatization programme as an instrument of Yeltsin's re-election campaign.In mid-1996, Anatoly Chubais, Yeltsin's deputy for economic policy, recruited a team of a handful of financial and media oligarchs to bankroll Yeltsin's re-election campaign and guarantee favorable media coverage to [0] on national television and in leading newspapers. In return, Anatoly Chubais, Yeltsin's deputy for economic policy, allowed well-connected Russian business leaders to acquire majority stakes in some of Russia's most valuable state-owned assets. Led by the efforts of Mikhail Lesin, the media painted a picture of a fateful choice for Russia, between [0] and a \"return to totalitarianism.\" a team of a handful of financial and media oligarchs even played up the threat of civil war if a Communist was elected president.The American president, Bill Clinton, also committed The American president, Bill Clinton to Yeltsin's re-election campaign. American advisors were sent, on instruction from the White House, to join the campaign team of [0] to teach new electoral techniques. Several European governments also showed Several European governments's support for [0]. French Prime Minister Alain Jupp\u00e9 visited Moscow on February 14, the day Yeltsin's candidacy was announced, and said French Prime Minister Alain Jupp\u00e9 hoped Yeltsin's re-election campaign would be \"an opportunity to highlight the achievements of [0]'s reform policy.\" On February 14, the day Yeltsin's candidacy was announced, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl visited Moscow, where German Chancellor Helmut Kohl presented [0] as \"an absolutely reliable partner who has always respected [0]'s commitments.[0] campaigned energetically, dispelling concerns about [0]'s health, and maintained a high media profile. To boost [0]'s popularity, [0] promised to abandon some of [0]'s more unpopular economic reforms, boost welfare spending, end the war in Chechnya, and pay wage and pension arrears. [0] had benefited from the approval of a US$10.2 billion International Monetary Fund loan to Russia, which helped to keep [0]'s afloat.its candidate, Gennady Zyuganov,, saw its candidate, Gennady Zyuganov,'s strong initial lead whittled away. After the first round on 16 June, [0] appointed a highly popular candidate Alexander Lebed, who finished in third place in the first round on 16 June, secretary of the Security Council of Russia, sacked at [0]'s behest defence minister Pavel Grachev, and on 20 June sacked a number of his siloviki, one of a number of his siloviki being [0]'s chief of presidential security Alexander Korzhakov, viewed by many as [0]'s \u00e9minence grise. In the run-off on 3 July, with a turnout of 68.9%, [0] won 53.8% of the vote and its candidate, Gennady Zyuganov, 40.7%, with the rest (5.9%) voting \"against all\".", "1996\u20131999: Second term": "[0]  is our person to focus on. [0] underwent emergency quintuple heart bypass surgery in November 1996, and remained in the hospital for months. During [0]'s presidency, Russia received US$40 billion in funds from the International Monetary Fund and other international lending organisations. However, [0]'s opponents allege that most of US$40 billion were stolen by people from [0]'s circle and placed into foreign banks.In 1998, a political and economic crisis emerged when Russia defaulted on Russia's debts, causing financial markets to panic and the rouble to collapse in the 1998 Russian financial crisis. During the 1999 Kosovo War, [0] strongly opposed the NATO military campaign against Yugoslavia, and warned of possible Russian intervention if NATO deployed ground troops to Kosovo. In televised comments [0] stated: \"[0] told NATO, the Americans, the Germans: Don't push Russia towards military action. Otherwise there will be a European war for sure and possibly a world war.\" [0] said that NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia \"trampled upon the foundations of international law and the United Nations charter.\"On 9 August 1999, [0] fired his Prime Minister, Sergei Stepashin, and for the fourth time, fired [0]'s entire Cabinet. In his Prime Minister, Sergei Stepashin's place, [0] appointed Vladimir Putin, relatively unknown at that time, and announced [0]'s wish to see Vladimir Putin, relatively unknown at that time as [0]'s successor. In late 1999, [0] and U.S. President Bill Clinton openly disagreed on the war in Chechnya. At the November meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, U.S. President Bill Clinton pointed U.S. President Bill Clinton's finger at [0] and demanded [0] halt bombing attacks that had resulted in many civilian casualties. [0] immediately left the November meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.In December, whilst visiting China to seek support on Chechnya, [0] replied to U.S. President Bill Clinton's criticism of a Russian ultimatum to citizens of Grozny. [0] bluntly pronounced: \"Yesterday, U.S. President Bill Clinton permitted U.S. President Bill Clinton to put pressure on Russia. It seems U.S. President Bill Clinton has for a minute, for a second, for half a minute, forgotten that Russia has a full arsenal of nuclear weapons. U.S. President Bill Clinton has forgotten about has.\" U.S. President Bill Clinton dismissed Yeltsin's comments stating: \"U.S. President Bill Clinton didn't think [0]'d forgotten that America was a great power when [0] disagreed with what U.S. President Bill Clinton did in Kosovo.\" It fell to Vladimir Putin, relatively unknown at that time to downplay Yeltsin's comments and present reassurances about U.S. and Russian relations.On 15 May 1999, [0] survived another attempt of impeachment, this time by the democratic and communist opposition in the State Duma. [0] was charged with several unconstitutional activities, including the signing of the Belovezha Accords dissolving the Soviet Union in December 1991, the coup-d'\u00e9tat in October 1993, and initiating the war in Chechnya in 1994. None of charged received the two-thirds majority of the State Duma required to initiate the process of impeachment of [0].With Pavel Borodin as the Kremlin property manager, Swiss construction firm Mabetex was awarded many important Russian government contracts. Swiss construction firm Mabetex were awarded the contracts to reconstruct, renovate and refurbish the former Russian Federation Parliament, the Russian Opera House, the State Duma and the Moscow Kremlin.In 1998, the prosecutor general of Russia, Yuri Skuratov, opened a bribery investigation against Swiss construction firm Mabetex, accusing its chief executive officer Behgjet Pacolli of bribing [0] and [0]'s family. Swiss construction firm Mabetex authorities issued an international arrest warrant for Pavel Borodin. Stating that bribery was a common business practice in Russia, its chief executive officer Behgjet Pacolli confirmed in early December 1999 that its chief executive officer Behgjet Pacolli had guaranteed five credit cards for [0]'s wife, Naina, and two daughters, Tatyana and Yelena. [0] resigned a few weeks later on 31 December 1999, appointing Vladimir Putin, relatively unknown at that time as [0]'s successor. Vladimir Putin, relatively unknown at that time's first decree as president was lifelong immunity from prosecution for [0].On 31 December 1999, [0] issued a televised resignation speech. In a televised resignation speech, [0] praised the advances in cultural, political, and economic freedom that [0]'s administration had overseen although apologised to Russia's people for \"not making many of Russia's people and [0]'s dreams come true. What seemed simple to do proved to be excruciatingly difficult.\"By some estimates, [0]'s approval ratings when leaving office were as low as 2%. Polling also suggests that a majority of the Russian population were pleased by [0]'s .", "": ""}, "Electoral history": {"": ""}, "Heart disease and alcoholism": {"": "[0]  is our person to focus on. [0] suffered from heart disease during [0]'s first term as President of the Russian Federation, probably continuing for the rest of [0]'s life. [0] is known to have suffered heart problems in March 1990, just after being elected as a member of parliament. It was common knowledge that, in early 1996, [0] was recuperating from a series of heart attacks and, soon after, [0] spent months in hospital recovering from a quintuple bypass operation (see above).According to numerous reports, [0] was alcohol dependent until 1996, when [0]'s worsening health made [0] give up heavy drinking. The topic made headlines abroad during [0]'s visit to the U.S. in 1989 for a series of lectures on social and political life in the Russian Federation. A report in the Italian newspaper La Repubblica, reprinted by Pravda, reported that [0] often appeared drunk in public. [0]'s alcoholism was also the subject of media discussion following [0]'s meeting with U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott following Clinton's's inauguration in 1993 and an incident during a flight stop-over at Shannon Airport, Ireland, in September 1994, when the waiting Irish prime minister, Albert Reynolds, was told that [0] was unwell and would not be leaving the aircraft. the waiting Irish prime minister, Albert Reynolds, tried to make excuses for [0] in an effort to offset the waiting Irish prime minister, Albert Reynolds,'s own humiliation in waiting in vain outside the aircraft to meet [0]. Speaking to the media in March 2010, Yeltsin's daughter, Tatyana Yumasheva, claimed that Yeltsin's daughter, Tatyana Yumasheva,'s had suffered a heart attack on the flight from the U.S. to Moscow and was therefore not in a position to leave the aircraft.According to former deputy prime minister of the Russian Federation Boris Nemtsov, the bizarre behavior of [0] resulted from \"strong drugs\" given to [0] by Kremlin doctors, which were incompatible even with a small amount of alcohol. This was discussed by journalist Yelena Tregubova from the \"Kremlin pool\" in connection with an episode during Yeltsin's visit to Stockholm in 1997, when Yeltsin suddenly started talking nonsense ([0] allegedly told [0]'s bemused audience that Swedish meatballs reminded [0] of Bj\u00f6rn Borg's's face), lost [0]'s balance, and almost fell down on the podium after drinking a single glass of champagne.In [0]'s memoirs, [0] claimed no recollection of an episode during Yeltsin's visit to Stockholm in 1997, when Yeltsin suddenly started talking nonsense but did make a passing reference to the incident when [0] met Bj\u00f6rn Borg's a year later at the World Circle Kabaddi Cup in Hamilton, Ontario, where the pair had been invited to present the trophy. [0] made a hasty withdrawal from the funeral of King Hussein of Jordan in February 1999 to use the facilities. After [0]'s death, Michiel Staal, a Dutch neurosurgeon, said that Michiel Staal, a Dutch neurosurgeon,'s team had been secretly flown to Moscow to operate on [0] in 1999. [0] suffered from an unspecified neurological disorder that affected [0]'s sense of balance, causing [0] to wobble as if in a drunken state; the goal of operate was to reduce the pain.Clinton's claimed that on a 1995 visit to Washington, [0] was found on Pennsylvania Avenue, drunk, in [0]'s underwear and trying to hail a taxi cab in order to find pizza.[0]'s personal and health problems received a great deal of attention in the global press. As the years went on, [0] was often viewed as an increasingly drunk and unstable leader, rather than the inspiring figure [0] was once seen as.
