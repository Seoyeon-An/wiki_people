{"summary": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] (8 January 1942\u00a0\u2013 14 March 2018) was an English theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and author who, at the time of [0]'s death, was director of research at the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology at the University of Cambridge. Between 1979 and 2009, [0] was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge, widely viewed as one of the most prestigious academic posts in the world.[0] was born in Oxford into a family of physicians. In October 1959, at the age of 17, [0] began [0]'s university education at University College, Oxford,  where [0] received a first-class BA degree in physics. In October 1962, [0] began [0]'s graduate work at Trinity Hall, the University of Cambridge, where, in March 1966, [0] obtained [0]'s PhD degree in applied mathematics and theoretical physics, specialising in general relativity and cosmology. In 1963, at age 21, [0] was diagnosed with an early-onset slow-progressing form of motor neurone disease that gradually, over decades, paralysed [0]. After the loss of [0]'s speech, [0] communicated through a speech-generating device initially through use of a handheld switch, and eventually by using a single cheek muscle.[0]'s scientific works included a collaboration with Roger Penrose on gravitational singularity theorems in the framework of general relativity, and the theoretical prediction that black holes emit radiation, often called Hawking radiation. Initially, radiation, often called Hawking radiation was controversial. By the late 1970s and following the publication of further research, the theoretical prediction that black holes emit radiation, often called Hawking radiation was widely accepted as a major breakthrough in theoretical physics. [0] was the first to set out a theory of cosmology explained by a union of general relativity and quantum mechanics. [0] was a vigorous supporter of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.[0] achieved commercial success with several works of popular science in which [0] discussed [0]'s theories and cosmology in general. [0]'s book A Brief History of Time appeared on the Sunday Times bestseller list for a record-breaking 237 weeks. [0] was a Fellow of the Royal Society, a lifetime member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, and a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the United States. In 2002, [0] was ranked number 25 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons. [0] died in 2018 at the age of 76, after having motor neurone disease for more than 50 years."}, "Early life": {"Family": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was born on 8 January 1942 in Oxford to Frank and Isobel Eileen Hawking (n\u00e9e Walker). Isobel Eileen Hawking (n\u00e9e Walker) was born into a family of doctors in Glasgow, Scotland. His wealthy paternal great-grandfather, from Yorkshire, over-extended His wealthy paternal great-grandfather, from Yorkshire, buying farm land and then went bankrupt in the great agricultural depression during the early 20th century. [0]'s paternal great-grandmother saved the family from financial ruin by opening a school in the family's home. Despite Frank and Isobel Eileen Hawking (n\u00e9e Walker)'s families' financial constraints, Frank and Isobel Eileen Hawking (n\u00e9e Walker) attended the University of Oxford, where Frank read medicine and Isobel Eileen Hawking (n\u00e9e Walker) read Philosophy, Politics and Economics. Isobel Eileen Hawking (n\u00e9e Walker) worked as a secretary for a medical research institute, and Frank was a medical researcher. [0] had two younger sisters, Philippa and Mary, and an adopted brother, Edward Frank David (1955\u20132003).In 1950, when [0]'s became head of the division of parasitology at the National Institute for Medical Research, the family moved to St Albans, Hertfordshire. In St Albans, Hertfordshire, the family was considered highly intelligent and somewhat eccentric; meals were often spent with each person silently reading a book. the family lived a frugal existence in a large, cluttered, and poorly maintained house and travelled in a converted London taxicab. During one of [0]'s frequent absences working in Africa, the rest of the family spent four months in Mallorca visiting Isobel Eileen Hawking (n\u00e9e Walker)'s and his mother's friend Beryl's husband, the poet Robert Graves.", "Primary and secondary school years": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] began [0]'s schooling at the Byron House School in Highgate, London. [0] later blamed the Byron House School in Highgate, London's \"progressive methods\" for [0]'s failure to learn to read while at the Byron House School in Highgate, London. In St Albans, [0] attended St Albans High School for Girls for a few months. At that time, younger boys could attend one of the houses.[0] attended two private (i.e. fee-paying) schools, first Radlett School and from September 1952, St Albans School, Hertfordshire, after passing the eleven-plus a year early. The family placed a high value on education. Hawking's father wanted Hawking's father's to attend Westminster School, but [0] was ill on the day of the scholarship examination. The family could not afford the school fees without the financial aid of a scholarship, so [0] remained at St Albans School, Hertfordshire. A positive consequence was that [0] remained close to a group of friends with whom he enjoyed board games, the manufacture of fireworks, model aeroplanes and boats, and long discussions about Christianity and extrasensory perception. From 1958 on, with the help of the mathematics teacher Dikran Tahta, a group of friends with whom he enjoyed board games, the manufacture of fireworks, model aeroplanes and boats, and long discussions about Christianity and extrasensory perception built a computer from clock parts, an old telephone switchboard and other recycled components.Although known at school as \"Einstein\", [0] was not initially successful academically. With time, [0] began to show considerable aptitude for scientific subjects and, inspired by the mathematics teacher Dikran Tahta, decided to read mathematics at university. Hawking's father advised [0] to study medicine, concerned that there were few jobs for mathematics graduates. Hawking's father also wanted Hawking's father's to attend University College, Oxford, Hawking's father's own alma mater. As it was not possible to read mathematics there at the time, [0] decided to study physics and chemistry. Despite [0]'s headmaster's advice to wait until the next year, [0] was awarded a scholarship after taking the examinations in March 1959.", "Undergraduate years": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] began [0]'s university education at University College, Oxford, in October 1959 at the age of 17. For the first eighteen months, [0] was bored and lonely\u00a0\u2013 [0] found the academic work \"ridiculously easy\". His physics tutor, Robert Berman, later said, \"It was only necessary for [0] to know that something could be done, and [0] could do something without looking to see how other people did something.\" A change occurred during [0]'s second and third years when, according to His physics tutor, Robert Berman,, [0] made more of an effort \"to be one of the boys\". [0] developed into a popular, lively and witty college-member, interested in classical music and science fiction. Part of developed resulted from [0]'s decision to join the college boat-club, the University College Boat Club, where [0] coxed a rowing-crew. The rowing-coach at the time noted that [0] cultivated a daredevil image, steering a rowing-crew on risky courses that led to damaged boats. [0] estimated that [0] studied about 1,000 hours during [0]'s three years at University College, Oxford,. These unimpressive study habits made sitting [0]'s finals a challenge, and [0] decided to answer only theoretical physics questions rather than those requiring factual knowledge. A first-class degree was a condition of acceptance for [0]'s planned graduate study in cosmology at the University of Cambridge. Anxious, [0] slept poorly the night before the examinations, and the result was on the borderline between first- and second-class honours, making a viva (oral examination) with the Oxford examiners necessary.[0] was concerned that [0] was viewed as a lazy and difficult student. So, when asked at a viva (oral examination) with the Oxford examiners to describe [0]'s plans, [0] said, \"If you award [0] a First, [0] will go to the University of Cambridge. If [0] receive a Second, [0] shall stay in University College, Oxford,, so [0] expect you will give [0] a First.\" [0] was held in higher regard than [0] believed; as His physics tutor, Robert Berman, commented, the Oxford examiners \"were intelligent enough to realise the Oxford examiners were talking to someone far cleverer than most of the Oxford examiners\". After receiving a first-class BA degree in physics and completing a trip to Iran with a friend, [0] began [0]'s graduate work at Trinity Hall, the University of Cambridge, in October 1962.", "Post-graduate years": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0]'s first year as a doctoral student was difficult. [0] was initially disappointed to find that [0] had been assigned Dennis William Sciama, one of the founders of modern cosmology, as a supervisor rather than the noted astronomer Fred Hoyle, and [0] found [0]'s training in mathematics inadequate for work in general relativity and cosmology. After being diagnosed with motor neurone disease, [0] fell into a depression\u00a0\u2013 though [0]'s doctors advised that [0] continue with his studies, [0] felt there was little point. motor neurone disease progressed more slowly than doctors had predicted. Although [0] had difficulty walking unsupported, and [0]'s speech was almost unintelligible, an initial diagnosis that [0] had only two years to live proved unfounded. With Dennis William Sciama, one of the founders of modern cosmology,'s encouragement, [0] returned to [0]'s work. [0] started developing a reputation for brilliance and brashness when [0] publicly challenged the work of the noted astronomer Fred Hoyle and the noted astronomer Fred Hoyle's student Jayant Narlikar at a lecture in June 1964.When [0] began his studies, there was much debate in the physics community about the prevailing theories of the creation of the universe: the Big Bang and Steady State theories. Inspired by Roger Penrose's's theorem of a spacetime singularity in the centre of black holes, [0] applied the same thinking to the entire universe; and, during 1965, [0] wrote his thesis on this topic. his thesis on this topic was approved in 1966. There were other positive developments: [0] received a research fellowship at Gonville and Caius College at Cambridge; [0] obtained [0]'s PhD degree in applied mathematics and theoretical physics, specialising in general relativity and cosmology, in March 1966; and [0]'s essay \"Singularities and the Geometry of Space\u2013Time\" shared top honours with one by Roger Penrose's to win 1966's prestigious Adams Prize.", "": ""}, "Career": {"1966\u20131975": "[0] is our person to focus on. In [0]'s work, and in collaboration with Penrose, [0] extended the singularity theorem concepts first explored in his doctoral thesis. the singularity theorem concepts first explored in his doctoral thesis included not only the existence of singularities but also the theory that the universe might have started as a singularity. Their's joint essay was the runner-up in the 1968 Gravity Research Foundation competition. In 1970, Their published a proof that if the universe obeys the general theory of relativity and fits any of the models of physical cosmology developed by Alexander Friedmann, then the universe must have begun as a singularity. In 1969, [0] accepted a specially created Fellowship for Distinction in Science to remain at Caius.In 1970, [0] postulated what became known as the second law of black hole dynamics, that the event horizon of a black hole can never get smaller. With James M. Bardeen and Brandon Carter, [0] proposed the four laws of black hole mechanics, drawing an analogy with thermodynamics. To [0]'s irritation, Jacob Bekenstein, a graduate student of John Wheeler, went further\u2014and ultimately correctly\u2014to apply thermodynamic concepts literally.In the early 1970s, [0]'s work with Brandon Carter, Werner Israel, and David C. Robinson strongly supported Brandon Carter's no-hair theorem, one that states that no matter what the original material from which a black hole is created, a black hole can be completely described by the properties of mass, electrical charge and rotation. [0]'s essay titled \"Black Holes\" won the Gravity Research Foundation Award in January 1971. [0]'s first book, The Large Scale Structure of Space-Time, written with George Ellis, was published in 1973.Beginning in 1973, [0] moved into the study of quantum gravity and quantum mechanics. [0]'s work in the study of quantum gravity and quantum mechanics was spurred by a visit to Moscow and discussions with Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich and Alexei Starobinsky, whose work showed that according to the uncertainty principle, rotating black holes emit particles. To [0]'s annoyance, [0]'s much-checked calculations produced findings that contradicted [0]'s second law, which claimed black holes could never get smaller, and supported Jacob Bekenstein, a graduate student of John Wheeler,'s reasoning about black holes's entropy.[0]'s results, which [0] presented from 1974, showed that black holes emit radiation, known today as Hawking radiation, which may continue until they exhaust their energy and evaporate. Initially, radiation, known today as Hawking radiation, which may continue until they exhaust their energy and evaporate was controversial. By the late 1970s and following the publication of further research, the discovery was widely accepted as a significant breakthrough in theoretical physics. [0] was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1974, a few weeks after the announcement of radiation, known today as Hawking radiation, which may continue until they exhaust their energy and evaporate. At the time, [0] was one of the youngest scientists to become a Fellow.[0] was appointed to the Sherman Fairchild Distinguished Visiting Professorship at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in 1974. [0] worked with a friend on the faculty, Kip Thorne, and engaged a friend on the faculty, Kip Thorne in a scientific wager about whether the X-ray source Cygnus X-1 was a black hole. a scientific wager about whether the X-ray source Cygnus X-1 was a black hole was an \"insurance policy\" against the proposition that black holes did not exist. [0] acknowledged that [0] had lost a scientific wager about whether the X-ray source Cygnus X-1 was a black hole in 1990, a bet that was the first of several [0] was to make with a friend on the faculty, Kip Thorne and others. [0] had maintained ties to the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), spending a month there almost every year since this first visit.", "1975\u20131990": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] returned to Cambridge in 1975 to a more academically senior post, as reader in gravitational physics. The mid-to-late 1970s were a period of growing public interest in black holes and the physicists who were studying black holes. [0] was regularly interviewed for print and television. [0] also received increasing academic recognition of [0]'s work. In 1975, [0] was awarded both the Eddington Medal and the Pius XI Gold Medal, and in 1976 the Dannie Heineman Prize, the Maxwell Medal and Prize and the Hughes Medal. [0] was appointed a professor with a chair in gravitational physics in 1977. The following year [0] received the Albert Einstein Medal and an honorary doctorate from the University of Oxford.In 1979, [0] was elected Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge. [0]'s inaugural lecture in this role was titled: \"Is the End in Sight for Theoretical Physics?\" and proposed N = 8 supergravity as the leading theory to solve many of the outstanding problems physicists were studying. [0]'s coincided with a health-crisis which led to [0]'s accepting, albeit reluctantly, some nursing services at home. At the same time, [0] was also making a transition in [0]'s approach to physics, becoming more intuitive and speculative rather than insisting on mathematical proofs. \"[0] would rather be right than rigorous\", [0] told Kip Thorne. In 1981, [0] proposed that information in a black hole is irretrievably lost when a black hole evaporates. This information paradox violates the fundamental tenet of quantum mechanics, and led to years of debate, including \"the Black Hole War\" with Leonard Susskind and Gerard 't Hooft.Cosmological inflation\u00a0\u2013 a theory proposing that following the Big Bang, the universe initially expanded incredibly rapidly before settling down to a slower expansion\u00a0\u2013 was proposed by Alan Guth and also developed by Andrei Linde. Following a conference in Moscow in October 1981, [0] and Gary Gibbons organised a three-week Nuffield Workshop in the summer of 1982 on \"The Very Early Universe\" at Cambridge, a workshop that focused mainly on inflation theory. [0] also began a new line of quantum-theory research into the origin of the universe. In 1981 at a Vatican conference, [0] presented work suggesting that there might be no boundary\u00a0\u2013 or beginning or ending\u00a0\u2013 to the universe.[0] subsequently developed the research in collaboration with Jim Hartle, and in 1983 they published a model, known as the Hartle\u2013Hawking state. a model, known as the Hartle\u2013Hawking state proposed that prior to the Planck epoch, the universe had no boundary in space-time; before the Big Bang, time did not exist and the concept of the beginning of the universe is meaningless. The initial singularity of the classical Big Bang models was replaced with a region akin to the North Pole. One cannot travel north of the North Pole, but there is no boundary there\u00a0\u2013 the North Pole is simply the point where all north-running lines meet and end. Initially, the no-boundary proposal predicted a closed universe, which had implications about the existence of God. As [0] explained, \"If the universe has no boundaries but is self-contained... then God would not have had any freedom to choose how the universe began.[0] did not rule out the existence of a Creator, asking in A Brief History of Time \"Is the unified theory so compelling that the unified theory brings about the unified theory's own existence?\", also stating \"If we discover a complete theory, discover would be the ultimate triumph of human reason\u00a0\u2013 for then we should know the mind of God\"; in [0]'s early work, [0] spoke of God in a metaphorical sense. In the same book [0] suggested that the existence of God was not necessary to explain the origin of the universe. Later discussions with Neil Turok led to the realisation that the existence of God was also compatible with an open universe.Further work by [0] in the area of arrows of time led to the 1985 publication of a paper theorising that if the no-boundary proposal were correct, then when the universe stopped expanding and eventually collapsed, time would run backwards. A paper by Don Page and independent calculations by Raymond Laflamme led [0] to withdraw this concept. Honours continued to be awarded: in 1981 [0] was awarded the American Franklin Medal, and in the 1982 New Year Honours appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). These awards did not significantly change [0]'s financial status, and motivated by the need to finance [0]'s children's education and home-expenses, [0] decided in 1982 to write a popular book about the universe that would be accessible to the general public. Instead of publishing with an academic press, [0] signed a contract with Bantam Books, a mass-market publisher, and received a large advance for a popular book about the universe that would be accessible to the general public. A first draft of a popular book about the universe that would be accessible to the general public, was completed in 1984.One of the first messages [0] produced with [0]'s speech-generating device was a request for [0]'s assistant to help [0] finish writing a popular book about the universe that would be accessible to the general public. Peter Guzzardi, [0]'s editor at Bantam Books, a mass-market publisher, pushed [0] to explain [0]'s ideas clearly in non-technical language, explain[0]. a popular book about the universe that would be accessible to the general public was published in April 1988 in the US and in June in the UK, and a popular book about the universe that would be accessible to the general public proved to be an extraordinary success, rising quickly to the top of best-seller lists in both countries and remaining there for months. a popular book about the universe that would be accessible to the general public was translated into many languages, and as of 2009, has sold an estimated 9\u00a0million copies.Media attention was intense, and a Newsweek magazine-cover and a television special both described [0] as \"Master of the Universe\". Success led to significant financial rewards, but also the challenges of celebrity status. [0] travelled extensively to promote [0]'s work, and enjoyed partying and dancing into the small hours. A difficulty refusing the invitations and visitors left [0] limited time for work and [0]'s students. Some colleagues were resentful of the attention Hawking received, feeling the attention Hawking received was due to [0]'s disability.[0] received further academic recognition, including five more honorary degrees, the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society (1985), the Paul Dirac Medal (1987) and, jointly with Penrose, the prestigious Wolf Prize (1988). In the 1989 Birthday Honours, [0] was appointed a Companion of Honour (CH). [0] reportedly declined a knighthood in the late 1990s in objection to the UK's science funding policy.", "1990\u20132000": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] pursued [0]'s work in physics: in 1993 [0] co-edited a book on Euclidean quantum gravity with Gary Gibbons and published a collected edition of [0]'s own articles on black holes and the Big Bang. In 1994, at Cambridge's Newton Institute, [0] and Penrose delivered a series of six lectures that were published in 1996 as \"The Nature of Space and Time\". In 1997, [0] conceded a 1991 public scientific wager made with Kip Thorne and John Preskill of Caltech. [0] had a 1991 public scientific wager made with Kip Thorne and John Preskill of Caltech that Penrose's proposal of a \"cosmic censorship conjecture\"\u00a0\u2013 that there could be no \"naked singularities\" unclothed within a horizon\u00a0\u2013 was correct.After discovering [0]'s might have been premature, a new and more refined wager was made. a new and more refined wager specified that such singularities would occur without extra conditions. 1997, Kip Thorne, [0] and John Preskill of Caltech made another bet, this time concerning the black hole information paradox. Kip Thorne argued that since general relativity made it impossible for black holes to radiate and lose information, the mass-energy and information carried by Hawking radiation must be \"new\", and not from inside the black hole event horizon. Since this contradicted the quantum mechanics of microcausality, quantum mechanics theory would need to be rewritten. John Preskill of Caltech argued the opposite, that since quantum mechanics suggests that the information emitted by a black hole relates to information that fell in at an earlier time, the concept of black holes given by general relativity must be modified in some way.[0] also maintained [0]'s public profile, including bringing science to a wider audience. A film version of A Brief History of Time, directed by Errol Morris and produced by Steven Spielberg, premiered in 1992. [0] had wanted A film version of A Brief History of Time, directed by Errol Morris and produced by Steven Spielberg, to be scientific rather than biographical, but [0] was persuaded otherwise. A film version of A Brief History of Time, directed by Errol Morris and produced by Steven Spielberg,, while a critical success, was not widely released. A popular-level collection of essays, interviews, and talks titled Black Holes and Baby Universes and Other Essays was published in 1993, and a six-part television series Stephen Hawking's Universe and a companion book appeared in 1997. As [0] insisted, this time the focus was entirely on science.", "2000\u20132018": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] continued [0]'s writings for a popular audience, publishing The Universe in a Nutshell in 2001, and A Briefer History of Time, which [0] wrote in 2005 with Leonard Mlodinow to update his earlier works with the aim of making his earlier works accessible to a wider audience, and God Created the Integers, which appeared in 2006. Along with Thomas Hertog at CERN and Jim Hartle, from 2006 on [0] developed a theory of top-down cosmology, which says that The Universe had not one unique initial state but many different ones, and therefore that it is inappropriate to formulate a theory that predicts The Universe's current configuration from one particular initial state. Top-down cosmology posits that the present \"selects\" the past from a superposition of many possible histories. In doing so, Top-down cosmology suggests a possible resolution of the fine-tuning question.[0] continued to travel widely, including trips to Chile, Easter Island, South Africa, Spain (to receive the Fonseca Prize in 2008), Canada, and numerous trips to the United States. For practical reasons related to [0]'s disability, [0] increasingly travelled by private jet, and by 2011 private jet had become [0]'s only mode of international travel.By 2003, consensus among physicists was growing that [0] was wrong about the loss of information in a black hole. In a 2004 lecture in Dublin, [0] conceded his 1997 bet with Preskill, but described [0]'s own, somewhat controversial solution to the information paradox problem, involving the possibility that black holes have more than one topology. In the 2005 paper [0] published on the information paradox problem, involving the possibility that black holes have more than one topology, [0] argued that the information paradox problem was explained by examining all the alternative histories of universes, with the information loss in those with black holes being cancelled out by those without such loss. In January 2014, [0] called the loss of information in a black hole [0]'s \"biggest blunder\".As part of another longstanding scientific dispute, [0] had emphatically argued, and bet, that the Higgs boson would never be found. the Higgs boson was proposed to exist as part of the Higgs field theory by Peter Higgs in 1964. [0] and Peter Higgs engaged in a heated and public debate over the matter in 2002 and again in 2008, with Peter Higgs criticising [0]'s work and complaining that [0]'s \"celebrity status gives [0] instant credibility that others do not have.\" the Higgs boson was discovered in July 2012 at CERN following construction of the Large Hadron Collider. [0] quickly conceded that [0] had lost his 1997 bet with Preskill and said that the Higgs boson should win the Nobel Prize for Physics, which [0] did in 2013.In 2007, [0] and [0]'s daughter Lucy published George's Secret Key to the Universe, a children's book designed to explain theoretical physics in an accessible fashion and featuring characters similar to those in the Hawking family. George's Secret Key to the Universe was followed by sequels in 2009, 2011, 2014 and 2016.In 2002, following a UK-wide vote, the BBC included [0] in the BBC's list of the 100 Greatest Britons. [0] was awarded the Copley Medal from the Royal Society (2006), the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which is the United States's highest civilian honour (2009), and the Russian Special Fundamental Physics Prize (2013).Several buildings have been named after [0], including the Stephen W. Hawking Science Museum in San Salvador, El\u00a0Salvador, the [0] Building in Cambridge, and the [0] Centre at the Perimeter Institute in Canada. Appropriately, given [0]'s association with time, [0] unveiled the mechanical \"Chronophage\" (or time-eating) Corpus Clock at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge in September 2008.During [0]'s career, [0] supervised 39 successful PhD students. One doctoral student did not successfully complete the PhD.[better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] As required by Cambridge University policy, [0] retired as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics in 2009. Despite suggestions that [0] might leave the United States as a protest against public funding cuts to basic scientific research, [0] worked as director of research at the Cambridge University Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics.On 28 June 2009, as a tongue-in-cheek test of [0]'s 1992 conjecture that travel into the past is effectively impossible, [0] held a party open to all, complete with hors d'oeuvres and iced champagne, but publicised a party open to all, complete with hors d'oeuvres and iced champagne only after a party open to all, complete with hors d'oeuvres and iced champagne was over so that only time-travellers would know to attend; as expected, nobody showed up to a party open to all, complete with hors d'oeuvres and iced champagne.On 20 July 2015, [0] helped launch Breakthrough Initiatives, an effort to search for extraterrestrial life. [0] created Stephen Hawking: Expedition New Earth, a documentary on space colonisation, as a 2017 episode of Tomorrow's World.In August 2015, [0] said that not all information is lost when something enters a black hole and there might be a possibility to retrieve information from a black hole according to [0]'s theory. In July 2017, [0] was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from Imperial College London.[0]'s final paper \u2013 A smooth exit from eternal inflation? \u2013 was posthumously published in the Journal of High Energy Physics on 27 April 2018.", "": ""}, "Personal life": {"Marriages": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] met his future wife, Jane Wilde, at a party in 1962. The following year, [0] was diagnosed with motor neurone disease. In October 1964, the couple became engaged to marry, aware of the potential challenges that lay ahead due to [0]'s shortened life expectancy and physical limitations. [0] later said that marry gave [0] \"something to live for\". the couple were married on 14 July 1965 in the couple's shared hometown of St Albans.the couple resided in Cambridge, within [0]'s walking distance to the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics (DAMTP). During the couple's first years of marriage, his future wife, Jane Wilde, lived in London during the week as his future wife, Jane Wilde, completed his future wife, Jane Wilde,'s degree at Westfield College. the couple travelled to the United States several times for conferences and physics-related visits. his future wife, Jane Wilde, began a PhD programme through Westfield College in medieval Spanish poetry (completed in 1981). the couple had three children: Robert, born May 1967, Lucy, born November 1970, and Timothy, born April [0] rarely discussed [0]'s illness and physical challenges\u2014even, in a precedent set during the couple's courtship, with his future wife, Jane Wilde,. [0]'s disabilities meant that the responsibilities of home and family rested firmly on his future wife, Jane Wilde,'s increasingly overwhelmed shoulders, leaving [0] more time to think about physics. Upon [0]'s appointment in 1974 to a year-long position at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California, his future wife, Jane Wilde, proposed that a graduate or post-doctoral student live with the couple and help with [0]'s care. [0] accepted, and Bernard Carr travelled with the couple as the first of many students who fulfilled help. the couple spent a generally happy and stimulating year in Pasadena, California.[0] returned to Cambridge in 1975 to a new home and a new job, as reader. Don Page, with whom Hawking had begun a close friendship at Caltech, arrived to work as the live-in graduate student assistant. With Don Page, with whom Hawking had begun a close friendship at Caltech,'s help and that of a secretary, his future wife, Jane Wilde,'s responsibilities were reduced so his future wife, Jane Wilde, could return to his future wife, Jane Wilde,'s doctoral thesis and his future wife, Jane Wilde,'s new interest in singing.Around December 1977, his future wife, Jane Wilde, met organist Jonathan Hellyer Jones when singing in a church choir. organist Jonathan Hellyer Jones became close to the couplethe couple , and by the mid-1980s, the couple his future wife, Jane Wilde, had developed romantic feelings for each other. According to his future wife, Jane Wilde,, his future wife, Jane Wilde,'s was accepting of the situation, stating \"[0] would not object so long as his future wife, Jane Wilde, continued to love [0]\". his future wife, Jane Wilde, organist Jonathan Hellyer Jones were determined not to break up the couple, and the couple's relationship remained platonic for a long period.By the mid-1980s, [0]'s marriage had been strained for many years. his future wife, Jane Wilde, felt overwhelmed by the intrusion into the couple's family life of the required nurses and assistants. The impact of [0]'s celebrity status was challenging for colleagues and family members, while the prospect of living up to a worldwide fairytale image was daunting for the couple. [0]'s views of religion also contrasted with his future wife, Jane Wilde,'s strong Christian faith and resulted in tension. After a tracheotomy in 1985, [0] required a full-time nurse and nursing care was split across 3 shifts daily. In the late 1980s, [0] grew close to one of his nurses, Elaine Mason, to the dismay of some colleagues, caregivers, and family members, who were disturbed by one of his nurses, Elaine Mason's strength of personality and protectiveness. In February 1990, [0] told his future wife, Jane Wilde, that [0] was leaving his future wife, Jane Wilde, for one of his nurses, Elaine Mason, and departed the family home. After [0]'s divorce from his future wife, Jane Wilde, in 1995, [0] married one of his nurses, Elaine Mason in September, declaring, \"It's wonderful\u00a0\u2013 [0] have married his future wife, Jane Wilde,.\"In 1999, his future wife, Jane Wilde, published a memoir, Music to Move the Stars, describing her marriage to Hawking and its breakdown. a memoir, Music to Move the Stars, describing her marriage to Hawking and its breakdown's revelations caused a sensation in the media but, as was [0]'s usual practice regarding [0]'s personal life, [0] made no public comment except to say that [0] did not read biographies about [0]. After [0]'s second marriage, the couple felt excluded and marginalised from [0]'s life. For a period of about five years in the early 2000s, [0]'s family and staff became increasingly worried that [0] was being physically abused. Police investigations took place, but were closed as [0] refused to make a complaint.In 2006, [0] and one of his nurses, Elaine Mason quietly divorced, and [0] resumed closer relationships with his future wife, Jane Wilde,, [0]'s children, and [0]'s grandchildren. Reflecting on this happier period, a revised version of his future wife, Jane Wilde,'s book, re-titled Travelling to Infinity: My Life with [0], appeared in 2007, and was made into a film, The Theory of Everything, in 2014.", "Disability": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] had a rare early-onset, slow-progressing form of motor neurone disease (MND; also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or Lou Gehrig's disease), a fatal neurodegenerative disease that affects the motor neurones in the brain and spinal cord, which gradually paralysed [0] over decades.[0] had experienced increasing clumsiness during [0]'s final year at Oxford, including a fall on some stairs and difficulties when rowing. increasing clumsiness worsened, and [0]'s speech became slightly slurred. [0]'s family noticed worsened when [0] returned home for Christmas, and medical investigations were begun. The motor neurone disease (MND; also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or Lou Gehrig's disease) diagnosis came when [0] was 21, in 1963. At the time, doctors gave [0] a life expectancy of two years.In the late 1960s, [0]'s physical abilities declined: [0] began to use crutches and could no longer give lectures regularly. As [0] slowly lost the ability to write, [0] developed compensatory visual methods, including seeing equations in terms of geometry. The physicist Werner Israel later compared the achievements to Mozart composing an entire symphony in Mozart's head. [0] was fiercely independent and unwilling to accept help or make concessions for [0]'s disabilities. [0] preferred to be regarded as \"a scientist first, popular science writer second, and, in all the ways that matter, a normal human being with the same desires, drives, dreams, and ambitions as the next person.\" His wife Jane later noted: \"Some people would call it determination, some obstinacy. His wife Jane've called it both at one time or another.\" [0] required much persuasion to accept the use of a wheelchair at the end of the late 1960s, but ultimately became notorious for the wildness of [0]'s wheelchair driving. [0] was a popular and witty colleague, but his illness, as well as [0]'s reputation for brashness, distanced [0] from some.When [0] first began using a wheelchair [0] was using standard motorised models. The earliest surviving example of standard motorised models was made by BEC Mobility and sold by Christie's in November 2018 for \u00a3296,750. [0] continued to use standard motorised models until the early 1990s, at which time [0]'s ability to use [0]'s hands to drive a wheelchair deteriorated. [0] used a variety of different chairs from that time, including a DragonMobility Dragon elevating powerchair from 2007, as shown in the April 2008 photo of [0] attending NASA's 50th anniversary; a Permobil C350 from 2014; and then a Permobil F3 from 2016.Hawking's speech deteriorated, and by the late 1970s [0] could be understood by only [0]'s family and closest friends. To communicate with others, someone who knew [0] well would interpret 2016.Hawking's speech into intelligible speech. Spurred by a dispute with the university over who would pay for the ramp needed for [0] to enter [0]'s workplace, [0] and His wife Jane campaigned for improved access and support for those with disabilities in Cambridge, including adapted student housing at the university. In general, [0] had ambivalent feelings about [0]'s role as a disability rights champion: while wanting to help others, [0] also sought to detach [0] from his illness and his illness's challenges. [0]'s lack of engagement in this area led to some criticism.During a visit to CERN on the border of France and Switzerland in mid-1985, [0] contracted pneumonia, which in [0]'s condition was life-threatening; [0] was so ill that His wife Jane was asked if life support should be terminated. His wife Jane refused, but the consequence was a tracheotomy, which required round-the-clock nursing care and caused the loss of what remained of [0]'s speech. The National Health Service was ready to pay for a nursing home, but His wife Jane was determined that [0] would live at home. The cost of the care was funded by an American foundation. Nurses were hired for the three shifts required to provide the round-the-clock support [0] required. One of those employed was Elaine Mason, who was to become Hawking's second wife.For [0]'s communication, [0] initially raised [0]'s eyebrows to choose letters on a spelling card, but in 1986 [0] received a computer program called the \"Equalizer\" from Walter Woltosz, CEO of Words Plus, who had developed an earlier version of a computer program called the \"Equalizer\" to help his mother-in-law, who also had ALS and had lost her ability to speak and write. In a method [0] used for the rest of his life, [0] could now simply press a switch to select phrases, words or letters from a bank of about 2,500\u20133,000 that were scanned. a computer program called the \"Equalizer\" was originally run on a desktop computer. Elaine Mason, who was to become Hawking's second wife's husband, David, a computer engineer, adapted a small computer and attached a small computer to his wheelchair.Released from the need to use somebody to interpret [0]'s speech, [0] commented that \"[0] can communicate better now than before [0] lost my voice.\" my voice had an American accent and is no longer produced. Despite the later availability of other voices, [0] retained my voice, saying that [0] preferred my voice and identified with my voice. Originally, [0] activated a switch using his hand and could produce up to 15 words per minute. Lectures were prepared in advance and were sent to the speech synthesiser in short sections to be delivered.[0] gradually lost the use of his hand, and in 2005 [0] began to control [0]'s communication device with movements of [0]'s cheek muscles, with a rate of about one word per minute. With lost there was a risk of [0] developing locked-in syndrome, so [0] collaborated with Intel Corporation researchers on systems that could translate [0]'s brain patterns or facial expressions into switch activations. After several prototypes that did not perform as planned, Intel Corporation researchers settled on an adaptive word predictor made by the London-based startup SwiftKey, which used a system similar to his original technology. [0] had an easier time adapting to an adaptive word predictor made by the London-based startup SwiftKey, which used a system similar to his original technology.By 2009, [0] could no longer drive his wheelchair independently, but the same people who created [0]'s new typing mechanics were working on a method to drive his wheelchair using movements made by [0]'s chin. drive proved difficult, since [0] could not move [0]'s neck, and trials showed that while [0] could indeed drive his wheelchair, the movement was sporadic and jumpy. Near the end of his life, [0] experienced increased breathing difficulties, often resulting in [0]'s requiring the usage of a ventilator, and being regularly hospitalised.", "Disability outreach": "[0] is our person to focus on. Starting in the 1990s, [0] accepted the mantle of role model for disabled people, lecturing and participating in fundraising activities. At the turn of the century, [0] and eleven other humanitarians signed the Charter for the Third Millennium on Disability, which called on governments to prevent disability and protect the rights of disabled people. In 1999, [0] was awarded the Julius Edgar Lilienfeld Prize of the American Physical Society.In August 2012, [0] narrated the \"Enlightenment\" segment of the 2012 Summer Paralympics opening ceremony in London. In 2013, the biographical documentary film Hawking, in which [0] is featured, was released. In September 2013, [0] expressed support for the legalisation of assisted suicide for the terminally ill. In August 2014, [0] accepted the Ice Bucket Challenge to promote ALS/MND awareness and raise contributions for research. As [0] had pneumonia in 2013, [0] was advised not to have ice poured over [0], but [0]'s children volunteered to accept the Ice Bucket Challenge to promote ALS/MND awareness and raise contributions for research on [0]'s behalf.", "Plans for a trip to space": "[0] is our person to focus on. In late 2006, [0] revealed in a BBC interview that one of [0]'s greatest unfulfilled desires was to travel to space; on hearing was, Richard Branson offered a free flight into space with Virgin Galactic, which [0] immediately accepted. Besides personal ambition, [0] was motivated by the desire to increase public interest in spaceflight and to show the potential of people with disabilities. On 26 April 2007, [0] flew aboard a specially-modified Boeing 727\u2013200 jet operated by Zero-G Corp off the coast of Florida to experience weightlessness. Fears that the manoeuvres would cause [0] undue discomfort proved incorrect, and flew was extended to eight parabolic arcs. flew was described as a successful test to see if [0] could withstand the g-forces involved in space flight. At the time, the date of [0]'s trip to space was projected to be as early as 2009, but commercial flights to space did not commence before [0]'s death.", "": ""}, "Death": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] died at [0]'s home in Cambridge on 14 March 2018, at the age of 76. [0]'s family stated that [0] \"died peacefully\". [0] was eulogised by figures in science, entertainment, politics, and other areas. The Gonville and Caius College flag flew at half-mast and a book of condolences was signed by students and visitors. A tribute was made to [0] in the closing speech by IPC President Andrew Parsons at the closing ceremony of the 2018 Paralympic Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea.His private funeral took place on 31 March 2018, at Great St Mary's Church, Cambridge. Guests at His private funeral included The Theory of Everything actors Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones, Queen guitarist and astrophysicist Brian May, and model Lily Cole. In addition, actor Benedict Cumberbatch, who played Stephen Hawking in [0], astronaut Tim Peake, Astronomer Royal Martin Rees and physicist Kip Thorne provided readings at His private funeral. Although [0] was an atheist, His private funeral took place with a traditional Anglican service. Following the cremation, a service of thanksgiving was held at Westminster Abbey on 15 June 2018, after which [0]'s ashes were interred in Westminster Abbey's nave, between the graves of Sir Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin.Inscribed on [0]'s memorial stone are the words \"Here lies what was mortal of [0] 1942\u20132018\" and his most famed equation. [0] directed, at least fifteen years before [0]'s , that his most famed equation be [0]'s epitaph.[note 1] In June 2018, it was announced that [0]'s words, set to music by Greek composer Vangelis, would be beamed into space from a European space agency satellite dish in Spain with the aim of reaching the nearest black hole, 1A 0620-00.Hawking's final broadcast interview, about the detection of gravitational waves resulting from the collision of two neutron stars, occurred in October 2017. [0]'s final words to the world appeared posthumously, in April 2018, in the form of a Smithsonian TV Channel documentary entitled, Leaving Earth: Or How to Colonize a Planet. One of [0]'s final research studies, entitled A smooth exit from eternal inflation?, about the origin of the universe, was published in the Journal of High Energy Physics in May 2018. Later, in October 2018, another of [0]'s final research studies, entitled Black Hole Entropy and Soft Hair, was published, and dealt with the \"mystery of what happens to the information held by objects once objects disappear into a black hole\". Also in October 2018, [0]'s last book, Brief Answers to the Big Questions, a popular science book presenting [0]'s final comments on the most important questions facing humankind, was published.On 8 November 2018, an auction of 22 personal possessions of [0], including [0]'s doctoral thesis (\"Properties of Expanding Universes\", PhD thesis, Cambridge University, 1965) and wheelchair, took place, and fetched about \u00a31.8\u00a0m. Proceeds from the auction sale of wheelchair went to two charities, the Motor Neurone Disease Association and the Stephen Hawking Foundation; proceeds from [0]'s other items went to his estate.In March 2019, it was announced that the Royal Mint would issue a commemorative 50p coin, only available as a commemorative edition, in honour of [0]. March 2019, [0]'s nurse, Patricia Dowdy, was struck off the nursing register for \"failures over [0]'s care and financial misconduct.\"In May 2021 it was announced that an Acceptance-in-Lieu agreement between HMRC, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, Cambridge University Library, Science Museum Group, and his estate, would see around 10,000 pages of [0]'s scientific and other papers remain in Cambridge, while objects including [0]'s wheelchairs, speech synthesisers, and personal memorabilia from [0]'s former Cambridge office would be housed at Science Museum Group. In February 2022 the \"[0] at Work\" display opened at Science Museum Group as the start of a two-year nationwide tour."}, "Personal views": {"Philosophy is unnecessary": "[0] is our person to focus on. At Google's Zeitgeist Conference in 2011, [0] said that \"philosophy is dead\". [0] believed that philosophers \"have not kept up with modern developments in science\", \"have not taken science sufficiently seriously and so Philosophy is no longer relevant to knowledge claims\", \"philosophers's art is dead\" and that scientists \"have become the bearers of the torch of discovery in our quest for knowledge\". [0] said that philosophical problems can be answered by science, particularly new scientific theories which \"lead us to a new and very different picture of the universe and our place in the universe\". [0]'s view was both praised and criticized.", "Future of humanity": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 2006, [0] posed an open question on the Internet: \"In a world that is in chaos politically, socially and environmentally, how can the human race sustain another 100 years?\", later clarifying: \"[0] don't know the answer. know is why [0] asked an open question, to get people to think about an open question, and to be aware of the dangers we now face.[0] expressed concern that life on Earth is at risk from a sudden nuclear war, a genetically engineered virus, global warming, or other dangers humans have not yet thought of. [0] stated: \"[0] regard it as almost inevitable that either a nuclear confrontation or environmental catastrophe will cripple Earth at some point in the next 1,000 years\", and considered an \"asteroid collision\" to be the biggest threat to Earth. Such a planet-wide disaster need not result in human extinction if the human race were to be able to colonise additional planets before the disaster. [0] viewed spaceflight and the colonisation of space as necessary for the future of humanity.[0] stated that, given the vastness of the universe, aliens likely exist, but that contact with aliens should be avoided. [0] warned that aliens might pillage Earth for resources. In 2010 [0] said, \"If aliens visit humanity, the outcome would be much as when Columbus landed in America, which didn't turn out well for the Native Americans.[0] warned that superintelligent artificial intelligence could be pivotal in steering humanity's fate, stating that \"the potential benefits are huge... Success in creating AI would be the biggest event in human history. Success in creating AI might also be the last, unless we learn how to avoid the risks.\" [0] was fearing that \"an extremely intelligent future AI will probably develop a drive to survive and acquire more resources as a step toward accomplishing whatever goal an extremely intelligent future AI has\", and that \"The real risk with AI isn't malice but competence. A super-intelligent AI will be extremely good at accomplishing A super-intelligent AI's , and if its goals aren't aligned with humanity, humanity're in trouble\". [0] also considered that the enormous wealth generated by machines needs to be redistributed to prevent exacerbated economic inequality.[0] was concerned about the future emergence of a race of \"superhumans\" that would be able to design their own evolution and, as well, argued that computer viruses in today's world should be considered a new form of life, stating that \"maybe it says something about human nature, that the only form of life we have created so far is purely destructive. Talk about creating life in our own image.\"", "Religion and atheism": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] claimed to be an atheist. In an interview published in The Guardian, [0] regarded \"the brain as a computer which will stop working when its components faila computer which will stop working when its components fail's \", and the concept of an afterlife as a \"fairy story for people afraid of the dark\". In 2011, narrating the first episode of the American television series Curiosity on the Discovery Channel, [0] declared:We are each free to believe what we want and it is [0]'s view that the simplest explanation is there is no God. No one created the universe and no one directs our fate. This leads [0] to a profound realisation. There is probably no heaven, and no afterlife either. We have this one life to appreciate the grand design of the universe, and for have, [0] am extremely grateful. [0]'s association with atheism and freethinking was in evidence from [0]'s university years onwards, when [0] had been a member of Oxford University's humanist group. [0] was later scheduled to appear as the keynote speaker at a 2017 Humanists UK conference. In an interview with El Mundo, [0] said:Before we understand science, it is natural to believe that God created the universe. But now science offers a more convincing explanation. What [0] meant by 'we would know the mind of God' is, we would know everything that God would know, if there were a God, which there isn't. [0]'m an atheist. In addition, [0] stated:If you like, you can call the laws of science 'God', but the laws of science wouldn't be a personal God that you would meet and put questions to. ", "Politics": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was a longstanding Labour Party supporter. [0] recorded a tribute for the 2000 Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore, called the 2003 invasion of Iraq a \"war crime\",  campaigned for nuclear disarmament, and supported stem cell research, universal health care, and action to prevent climate change. In August 2014, [0] was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to The Guardian expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September's referendum on that issue. [0] believed a the United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union (Brexit) would damage the United Kingdom's contribution to science as modern research needs international collaboration, and that free movement of people in Europe encourages the spread of ideas. [0] said to Theresa May, \"[0] deal with tough mathematical questions every day, but please don't ask [0] to help with the European Union (Brexit).\"  [0] was disappointed by the European Union (Brexit) and warned against envy and isolationism.[0] was greatly concerned over health care, and maintained that without the UK National Health Service, [0] could not have survived into [0]'s 70s. [0] especially feared privatisation. [0] stated, \"The more profit is extracted from the UK National Health Service, the more private monopolies grow and the more expensive healthcare becomes. the UK National Health Service must be preserved from commercial interests and protected from those who want to privatise the UK National Health Service.\" [0] blamed the Conservatives for cutting funding to the UK National Health Service, weakening the UK National Health Service by privatisation, lowering staff morale through holding pay back and reducing social care. [0] accused Jeremy Hunt of cherry picking evidence which [0] maintained debased science. [0] also stated, \"There is overwhelming evidence that the UK National Health Service funding and the numbers of doctors and nurses are inadequate, and it is getting worse.\"In June 2017, [0] endorsed Labour Party in the 2017 UK general election, citing the Conservatives's proposed cuts to the UK National Health Service. But [0] was also critical of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, expressing scepticism over whether Labour Party could win a general election under Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.[0] feared Donald Trump's's policies on global warming could endanger the planet and make global warming irreversible. [0] said, \"climate change is one of the great dangers we face, and climate change's one we can prevent if we act now. By denying the evidence for climate change, and pulling out of the Paris Agreement, Donald Trump's will cause avoidable environmental damage to the planet, endangering the natural world, for our and our's children.\" [0] further stated that this could lead the planet \"to become like Venus, with a temperature of two hundred and fifty degrees, and raining sulphuric acid\".[0] was also a supporter of a universal basic income.
