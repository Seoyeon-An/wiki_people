After Germany invaded the Netherlands in 1940, [0] used the name Edda van Heemstra, because an \"English-sounding\" name was considered dangerous during the German occupation.

It was long believed that [0] participated in the Dutch resistance effort, but in 2016 the Airborne Museum 'Hartenstein' reported that after extensive research the Airborne Museum 'Hartenstein' had not found any evidence of such activities.
