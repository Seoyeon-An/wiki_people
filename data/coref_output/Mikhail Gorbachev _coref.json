At the time, the village of Privolnoye, then in the North Caucasus Krai of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, Soviet Union was divided almost evenly between ethnic Russians and ethnic Ukrainians. [0]'s paternal family were ethnic Russians and had moved to the region from Voronezh several generations before; his maternal family were of ethnic Ukrainian heritage and had migrated from Chernihiv. His parents named [0] Viktor at birth, but at the insistence of [0]'s mother\u2014a devout Orthodox Christian\u2014[0] had a secret baptism, where his grandfather christened [0] Mikhail. [0]'s relationship with his father, Sergey Andreyevich Gorbachev, was close; his mother, Maria Panteleyevna Gorbacheva (n\u00e9e Gopkalo), was colder and punitive. His parents were poor, and lived as peasants. His parents had married as teenagers in 1928, and in keeping with local tradition had initially resided in his father, Sergey Andreyevich Gorbachev,'s house, an adobe-walled hut, before a hut of His parents's own could be built.the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, Soviet Union was a one-party state governed by the Communist Party, and during [0]'s childhood was under the leadership of Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin had initiated a project of mass rural collectivization which, in keeping with Joseph Stalin's Marxist\u2013Leninist ideas, Joseph Stalin believed would help convert the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, Soviet Union into a socialist society. his grandfather joined the Communist Party and helped form the village of Privolnoye, then in the North Caucasus Krai of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, Soviet Union's in 1929, becoming the village's first kolkhoz (collective farm)'s chair. the village's first kolkhoz (collective farm) was 19 kilometres (12\u00a0mi) outside the village of Privolnoye, then in the North Caucasus Krai of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, Soviet Union and when [0] was three years old, [0] left [0]'s parental home and moved into the village's first kolkhoz (collective farm) with his maternal family.the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, Soviet Union was then experiencing the famine of 1930\u20131933, in which two of Gorbachev's paternal uncles and an aunt died. the famine of 1930\u20131933, in which two of Gorbachev's paternal uncles and an aunt died was followed by the Great Purge, in which individuals accused of being \"enemies of the people\", including those sympathetic to rival interpretations of Marxism like Trotskyism, were arrested and interned in labor camps, if not executed. Both of [0]'s grandfathers were arrested ([0]'s maternal in 1934 and [0]'s paternal in 1937) and spent time in Gulag labor camps before being released. After released, his grandfather discussed having been tortured by the secret police, an account that influenced [0].Following on from the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, in June 1941 the German Army invaded the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, Soviet Union.

[0] also applied to study at the law school of Moscow State University (MSU), then the most prestigious university in the country. Moscow State University (MSU), then the most prestigious university in the country accepted [0] without asking for an exam, likely because of [0]'s worker-peasant origins and [0]'s possession of the Order of the Red Banner of Labour.

In 1952, [0] was appointed a full member of the highly advanced, genuinely revolutionary Communist Party of Bolsheviks. As a the highly advanced, genuinely revolutionary Communist Party of Bolsheviks and Komsomol member, [0] was tasked with monitoring fellow students for potential subversion; some of his fellow students said that [0] did so only minimally and that some of his fellow students trusted [0] to keep confidential information secret from the authorities.

On 25 September 1953 the duo Raisa Titarenko, who was studying in the university's philosophy department registered a wedding at Sokolniki Registry Office and in October moved in together at the Lenin Hills dormitory. Raisa Titarenko, who was studying in the university's philosophy department discovered that Raisa Titarenko, who was studying in the university's philosophy department was pregnant and although the duo wanted to keep the child Raisa Titarenko, who was studying in the university's philosophy department fell ill and required a life-saving abortion.In June 1955, [0] graduated with a distinction; [0]'s final paper had been on the advantages of \"socialist democracy\" (the Soviet political system) over \"bourgeois democracy\" (liberal democracy). [0] was subsequently assigned to the Soviet Procurator's office, which was then focusing on the rehabilitation of the innocent victims of Stalin's purges, but found that the Soviet Procurator's office, which was then focusing on the rehabilitation of the innocent victims of Stalin's purges had no work for [0].

Few in the government imagined that [0] would be as radical a reformer as [0] proved. Although not a well-known figure to the Soviet public, there was widespread relief that [0] was not elderly and ailing. [0]'s first public appearance as leader was at Chernenko's Red Square funeral, held on 14 March. Two months after being elected, [0] left Moscow for the first time, traveling to Leningrad, where [0] spoke to assembled crowds. In June [0] traveled to Ukraine, in July to Belarus, and in September to Tyumen Oblast, urging party members in these areas to take more responsibility for fixing local problems.", "1985\u20131986: early years": "[0]  is our person to focus on. [0]'s leadership style differed from that of [0]'s predecessors. [0] would stop to talk to civilians on the street, forbade the display of [0]'s portrait at the 1985 Red Square holiday celebrations, and encouraged frank and open discussions at Politburo meetings. To the West, [0] was seen as a more moderate and less threatening Soviet leader; some Western commentators however believed this an act to lull Western governments into a false sense of security. His wife was [0]'s closest adviser, and took on the unofficial role of a \"first lady\" by appearing with [0] on foreign trips; His wife's public visibility was a breach of standard practice and generated resentment. [0]'s other close aides were Georgy Shakhnazarov and Anatoly Chernyaev.[0] was aware that Politburo could remove [0] from office, and that [0] could not pursue more radical reform without a majority of supporters in Politburo. [0] sought to remove several older members from Politburo, encouraging Grigory Romanov, Nikolai Tikhonov, and Viktor Grishin into retirement. [0] promoted Gromyko to head of state, a largely ceremonial role with little influence, and moved [0]'s own ally, Eduard Shevardnadze, to Gromyko's former post in charge of foreign policy. Other allies whom [0] saw promoted were Yakovlev, Anatoly Lukyanov, and Vadim Medvedev. Another of those promoted by [0] was Boris Yeltsin, who was made a Secretary of the Central Committee (26th term) in July 1985. Most of these appointees were from a new generation of well-educated officials who had been frustrated during the Gromyko era. In [0]'s first year, 14 of the 23 heads of department in the Secretariat were replaced. Doing so, [0] secured dominance in Politburo within a year, faster than either Stalin, Khrushchev, or Gromyko had achieved.[0] recurrently employed the term perestroika, first used publicly in March 1984. [0] saw the term perestroika, first used publicly in March 1984 as encompassing a complex series of reforms to restructure society and the economy. [0] was concerned by the country's's low productivity, poor work ethic, and inferior quality goods; like several economists, [0] feared this would lead to the country's becoming a second-rate power. The first stage of Gorbachev's perestroika was uskoreniye (\"acceleration\"), a term [0] used regularly in the first two years of his leadership. The Soviet Union was behind the United States in many areas of production, but [0] claimed that The Soviet Union would accelerate industrial output to match that of the United States by 2000. The Five Year Plan of 1985\u20131990 was targeted to expand machine building by 50 to 100%. To boost agricultural productivity, [0] merged five ministries and a state committee into a single entity, Agroprom, although by late 1986 [0] acknowledged merged as a failure.The purpose of reform was to prop up the centrally planned economy\u2014not to transition to market socialism. Speaking in late summer 1985 to the secretaries for economic affairs of the central committees of the East European communist parties, [0] said: \"Many of the secretaries for economic affairs of the central committees of the East European communist parties see the solution to the secretaries for economic affairs of the central committees of the East European communist parties's problems in resorting to market mechanisms in place of direct planning. Some of the secretaries for economic affairs of the central committees of the East European communist parties look at the market as a lifesaver for the secretaries for economic affairs of the central committees of the East European communist parties's economies. But, the secretaries for economic affairs of the central committees of the East European communist parties, the secretaries for economic affairs of the central committees of the East European communist parties should not think about lifesavers but about the ship, and the ship is socialism.\" Gorbachev's perestroika also entailed attempts to move away from technocratic management of the economy by increasingly involving the labor force in industrial production. [0] was of the view that once freed from the strong control of central planners, state-owned enterprises would act as market agents. Gorbachev and other Soviet leaders did not anticipate opposition to the perestroika reforms; according to Gorbachev and other Soviet leaders's interpretation of Marxism, Gorbachev and other Soviet leaders believed that in a socialist society like The Soviet Union there would not be \"antagonistic contradictions\". However, there would come to be a public perception in the country's that many bureaucrats were paying lip service to the perestroika reforms while trying to undermine the perestroika reforms. [0] also initiated the concept of gospriyomka (state acceptance of production) during [0]'s time as leader, which represented quality control. In April 1986, [0] introduced an agrarian reform which linked salaries to output and allowed collective farms to sell 30% of their produce directly to shops or co-operatives rather than giving 30% of their produce to the state for distribution. In a September 1986 speech, [0] embraced the idea of reintroducing market economics to the country's alongside limited private enterprise, citing Lenin's New Economic Policy as a precedent; [0] nevertheless stressed that [0] did not regard reintroducing as a return to capitalism.In The Soviet Union, alcohol consumption had risen steadily between 1950 and 1985. By the 1980s, drunkenness was a major social problem and Andropov had planned a major campaign to limit alcohol consumption. Encouraged by His wife, [0]a major campaign to limit alcohol consumption \u2014oversaw a major campaign to limit alcohol consumption's implementation. Alcohol production was reduced by around 40%, the legal drinking age rose from 18 to 21, alcohol prices were increased, stores were banned from selling Alcohol production before 2\u00a0pm, and tougher penalties were introduced for workplace or public drunkenness and home production of alcohol. The All-Union Voluntary Society for the Struggle for Temperance was formed to promote sobriety; The All-Union Voluntary Society for the Struggle for Temperance had over 14\u00a0million members within three years. As a result, crime rates fell and life expectancy grew slightly between 1986 and 1987. However, bootleg liquor production rose considerably, and reform imposed large costs on the Soviet economy, resulting in losses of up to US$100\u00a0billion between 1985 and 1990. [0] later considered a major campaign to limit alcohol consumption to have been an error, and a major campaign to limit alcohol consumption was terminated in October 1988. After a major campaign to limit alcohol consumption ended, it took several years for production to return to previous levels, after which alcohol consumption soared in the country's between 1990 and 1993.In the second year of his leadership, [0] began speaking of glasnost, or \"openness\". According to Doder and Branson, glasnost, or \"openness\" meant \"greater openness and candour in government affairs and for an interplay of different and sometimes conflicting views in political debates, in the press, and in Soviet culture\". Encouraging reformers into prominent media positions, [0] brought in Sergei Zalygin as head of Novy Mir magazine and Yegor Yakovlev as editor-in-chief of Moscow News. [0] made the historian Yury Afanasyev dean of the State Historical Archive Faculty, from where the historian Yury Afanasyev could press for the opening of secret archives and the reassessment of Soviet history. Prominent dissidents like Andrei Sakharov were freed from internal exile or prison. [0] saw glasnost, or \"openness\" as a necessary measure to ensure perestroika by alerting the Soviet populace to the nature of the country's problems in the hope that the Soviet populace would support [0]'s efforts to fix the country's problems. Particularly popular among the Soviet intelligentsia, who became key [0] supporters, glasnost, or \"openness\" boosted [0]'s domestic popularity but alarmed many Communist Party hardliners. For many Soviet citizens, this newfound level of freedom of speech and press\u2014and this newfound level of freedom of speech and press's accompanying revelations about the country's's past\u2014was uncomfortable.Some in Communist Party thought [0] was not going far enough in [0]'s reforms; a prominent liberal critic was Yeltsin. Yeltsin had risen rapidly since 1985, attaining the role of party secretary in Moscow News. Like many members of the government, [0] was skeptical of Yeltsin, believing that Yeltsin engaged in too much self-promotion. Yeltsin was also critical of [0], regarding [0] as patronizing. In early 1986, Yeltsin began sniping at [0] in Politburo meetings. At the Twenty-Seventh Party Congress in February, Yeltsin called for more far-reaching reforms than [0] was initiating and criticized the party leadership, although Yeltsin did not cite [0] by name, claiming that a new cult of personality was forming. [0] then opened the floor to responses, after which attendees publicly criticized Yeltsin for several hours. After this, [0] also criticized Yeltsin, claiming that Yeltsin cared only for Yeltsin and was \"politically illiterate\". Yeltsin then resigned both as Moscow News party secretary and as a member of Politburo. From this point, tensions between the two men developed into a mutual hatred.In April 1986 the Chernobyl disaster occurred. In the immediate aftermath, officials fed [0] incorrect information to downplay the Chernobyl disaster. As the scale of the Chernobyl disaster became apparent, 336,000 people were evacuated from the area around the Chernobyl disaster. Taubman noted that the Chernobyl disaster marked \"a turning point for [0] and the Soviet regime\". Several days after the Chernobyl disaster occurred, Taubman gave a televised report to the country's. Taubman cited the Chernobyl disaster as evidence for what Taubman regarded as widespread problems in Soviet society, such as shoddy workmanship and workplace inertia. [0] later described the Chernobyl disaster as one which made [0] appreciate the scale of incompetence and cover-ups in The Soviet Union. From April 1986 to the end of the year, [0] became increasingly open in [0]'s criticism of the Soviet system, including food production, state bureaucracy, the military draft, and the large size of the prison population.In a May 1985 speech given to the Soviet Foreign Ministry\u2014the first time a Soviet leader had directly addressed a Soviet leader's diplomats\u2014[0] spoke of a \"radical restructuring\" of foreign policy. A major issue facing his leadership was Soviet involvement in the Afghan Civil War, which had then been going on for over five years. Over the course of the Afghan Civil War, which had then been going on for over five years, the Soviet Army took heavy casualties and there was much opposition to Soviet involvement among both the public and military. On becoming leader, [0] saw withdrawal from the Afghan Civil War, which had then been going on for over five years as a key priority. In October 1985, [0] met with Afghan Marxist leader Babrak Karmal, urging Afghan Marxist leader Babrak Karmal to acknowledge the lack of widespread public support for Afghan Marxist leader Babrak Karmal's and pursue a power sharing agreement with the opposition. October 1985, Politburo approved [0]'s decision to withdraw combat troops from Afghanistan, although the last troops did not leave until February [0] had inherited a renewed period of high tension in the Cold War. [0] believed strongly in the need to sharply improve relations with the United States; [0] was appalled at the prospect of nuclear war, was aware that The Soviet Union was unlikely to win the arms race and thought that the continued focus on high military spending was detrimental to [0]'s desire for domestic reform. US president Ronald Reagan publicly appeared to not want a de-escalation of tensions, having scrapped d\u00e9tente and arms controls, initiating a military build-up, and calling The Soviet Union the \"evil empire\".Both Gorbachev and Reagan wanted a summit to discuss the Cold War, but each faced some opposition to such a move within Both Gorbachev and Reagan's respective governments. Both Gorbachev and Reagan agreed to hold a summit in Geneva, Switzerland, in November 1985. In the buildup to a summit, [0] sought to improve relations with the United States's NATO allies, visiting France in October 1985 to meet with President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand. At a summitGeneva, Switzerland , discussions between Both Gorbachev and Reagan were sometimes heated, and [0] was initially frustrated that US president Ronald Reagan \"does not seem to hear what [0] am trying to say\". As well as discussing the the Cold War proxy conflicts in Afghanistan and Nicaragua and human rights issues, Both Gorbachev and Reagan discussed the US's Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), to which [0] was strongly opposed. Both Gorbachev and Reagan's wives also met and spent time together at a summit. a summit ended with a joint commitment to avoiding nuclear war and to meet for two further summits: in Washington, DC, in 1986 and in Moscow News in 1987. Following a summit, [0] traveled to Prague to inform other Warsaw Pact leaders of developments.In January 1986, [0] publicly proposed a three-stage programme for abolishing the world's nuclear weapons by the end of the 20th century. An agreement was then reached to meet with US president Ronald Reagan in Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland, in October 1986. [0] wanted to secure guarantees that the US's Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) would not be implemented, and in return was willing to offer concessions, including a 50% reduction in Soviet long range nuclear missiles. Both Gorbachev and Reagan agreed with the shared goal of abolishing nuclear weapons, but US president Ronald Reagan refused to terminate the US's Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) the US's Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) and no deal was reached. After a summit, many of US president Ronald Reagan's allies criticized US president Ronald Reagan for going along with the idea of abolishing nuclear weapons. [0] meanwhile told Politburo that US president Ronald Reagan was \"extraordinarily primitive, troglodyte, and intellectually feeble\".In [0]'s relations with the developing world, [0] found many of the developing world's leaders professing revolutionary socialist credentials or a pro-Soviet attitude\u2014such as Libya's Muammar Gaddafi and Syria's Hafez al-Assad\u2014frustrating, and [0]'s best personal relationship was instead with India's prime minister, Rajiv Gandhi. [0] thought that the \"socialist camp\" of Marxist\u2013Leninist governed states\u2014the Eastern Bloc countries, North Korea, Vietnam, and Cuba\u2014were a drain on the Soviet economy, receiving a far greater amount of goods from The Soviet Union than the \"socialist camp\" of Marxist\u2013Leninist governed states\u2014the Eastern Bloc countries, North Korea, Vietnam, and Cuba\u2014 collectively gave in return. [0] sought improved relations with China, a country whose Marxist government had severed ties with the Soviets in the Sino-Soviet split and had since undergone its own structural reformChina, a country whose Marxist government had severed ties with the Soviets in the Sino-Soviet split and had since undergone its own structural reform's . In June 1985 [0] signed a US$14\u00a0billion five-year trade agreement with China, a country whose Marxist government had severed ties with the Soviets in the Sino-Soviet split and had since undergone its own structural reform and in July 1986, [0] proposed troop reductions along the Soviet-Chinese border, hailing China, a country whose Marxist government had severed ties with the Soviets in the Sino-Soviet split and had since undergone its own structural reform as \"a great socialist country\". [0] made clear [0]'s desire for Soviet membership of the Asian Development Bank and for greater ties to Pacific countries, especially China, a country whose Marxist government had severed ties with the Soviets in the Sino-Soviet split and had since undergone its own structural reform and Japan.", "1987\u20131989: further reforms": "[0]  is our person to focus on. In January 1987, [0] attended a Central Committee plenum where he talked about perestroika and democratization while criticizing widespread corruption. [0] considered putting a proposal to allow multi-party elections into [0]'s speech, but decided against doing so. After a Central Committee plenum where he talked about perestroika and democratization while criticizing widespread corruption, [0] focused [0]'s attentions on economic reform, holding discussions with government officials and economists. Many economists proposed reducing ministerial controls on the economy and allowing state-owned enterprises to set state-owned enterprises's own targets; Ryzhkov and other government figures were skeptical. In June, [0] finished his report on economic reform. his report on economic reform reflected a compromise: ministers would retain the ability to set output targets but output targets would not be considered binding. That month, a plenum accepted [0]'s recommendations and the Supreme Soviet passed a \"law on enterprises\" implementing the changes. Economic problems remained: by the late 1980s there were still widespread shortages of basic goods, rising inflation, and declining living standards. widespread shortages of basic goods, rising inflation, and declining living standards stoked a number of miners' strikes in 1989.By 1987, the ethos of glasnost had spread through Soviet society: journalists were writing increasingly openly, many economic problems were being publicly revealed, and studies appeared that critically reassessed Soviet history. [0] was broadly supportive, describing glasnost as \"the crucial, irreplaceable weapon of perestroika\". [0] nevertheless insisted that people should use the newfound freedom responsibly, stating that journalists and writers should avoid \"sensationalism\" and be \"completely objective\" in journalists and writers's reporting. Nearly two hundred previously restricted Soviet films were publicly released, and a range of Western films were also made available. In 1989, Soviet responsibility for the 1940 Katyn massacre was finally revealed.In September 1987, the government stopped jamming the signal of the British Broadcasting Corporation and Voice of America. the changes also included greater tolerance of religion; an Easter service was broadcast on Soviet television for the first time and the millennium celebrations of the Russian Orthodox Church were given media attention. Independent organizations appeared, most supportive of [0], although the largest, Pamyat, was ultra-nationalist and antisemitic in nature. [0] also announced that Soviet Jews wishing to migrate to Israel would be allowed to do so, something previously prohibited.In August 1987, [0] holidayed in Nizhnyaya Oreanda in Oreanda, Crimea, there writing Perestroika: New Thinking for Our Country and Our World at the suggestion of US publishers. For the 70th anniversary of the October Revolution of 1917\u2014which brought Lenin and the Communist Party to power\u2014[0] produced a speech on \"October and Perestroika: The Revolution Continues\". Delivered to a ceremonial joint session of Central Committee and the Supreme Soviet in the Kremlin Palace of Congresses, a speech on \"October and Perestroika: The Revolution Continues\" praised Lenin but criticized Stalin for overseeing mass human rights abuses. Party hardliners thought a speech on \"October and Perestroika: The Revolution Continues\" went too far; liberalisers thought a speech on \"October and Perestroika: The Revolution Continues\" did not go far enough.In March 1988, the magazine Sovetskaya Rossiya published an open letter by the teacher Nina Andreyeva. an open letter by the teacher Nina Andreyeva criticized elements of [0]'s reforms, attacking what the teacher Nina Andreyeva regarded as the denigration of the Stalinist era and arguing that a reformer clique\u2014whom the teacher Nina Andreyeva implied were mostly Jews and ethnic minorities\u2014were to blame. Over 900 Soviet newspapers reprinted an open letter by the teacher Nina Andreyeva and anti-reformists rallied around an open letter by the teacher Nina Andreyeva; many reformers panicked, fearing a backlash against perestroika. On returning from Yugoslavia, [0] called a Politburo meeting to discuss an open letter by the teacher Nina Andreyeva, at which [0] confronted those hardliners supporting an open letter by the teacher Nina Andreyeva's sentiment. Ultimately, Politburo arrived at a unanimous decision to express disapproval of an open letter by the teacher Nina Andreyeva and publish a rebuttal in Pravda. Yakovlev and Gorbachev's rebuttal claimed that those who \"look everywhere for internal enemies\" were \"not patriots\" and presented Stalin's \"guilt for massive repressions and lawlessness\" as \"enormous and unforgiveable\".Although the next party congress was not scheduled until 1991, [0] convened the 19th Party Conference in the next party congress's place in June 1988. [0] hoped that by allowing a broader range of people to attend than at previous conferences, [0] would gain additional support for the changes. With sympathetic officials and academics, [0] drafted plans for reforms that would shift power away from Politburo and towards the soviets. While the soviets had become largely powerless bodies that rubber-stamped Politburo policies, [0] wanted the soviets to become year-round legislatures. [0] proposed the formation of a new institution, the Congress of People's Deputies, whose members were to be elected in a largely free vote. a new institution, the Congress of People's Deputies, whose members were to be elected in a largely free vote would in turn elect a USSR Supreme Soviet, which would do most of the legislating.These proposals reflected [0]'s desire for more democracy; however, in [0]'s view there was a major impediment in that the Soviet people had developed a \"slave psychology\" after centuries of Tsarist autocracy and Marxist\u2013Leninist authoritarianism. Held at the Kremlin Palace of Congresses, the 19th Party Conference brought together 5,000 delegates and featured arguments between hardliners and liberalisers. The proceedings were televised, and for the first time since the 1920s, voting was not unanimous. In the months following the 19th Party Conference, [0] focused on redesigning and streamlining the party apparatus; the Central Committee staff\u2014which then numbered around 3,000\u2014was halved, while various Central Committee departments were merged to cut down the overall number from twenty to nine.In March and April 1989, elections to a new institution, the Congress of People's Deputies, whose members were to be elected in a largely free vote were held. Of the 2,250 legislators to be elected, one hundred\u2014termed the \"Red Hundred\" by the press\u2014were directly chosen by the Communist Party, with [0] ensuring many were reformists. Although over 85% of elected deputies were party members, many of those elected\u2014including Lenin and Yeltsin\u2014were liberalisers. [0] was happy with the result, describing the result as \"an enormous political victory under extraordinarily difficult circumstances\". a new institution, the Congress of People's Deputies, whose members were to be elected in a largely free vote convened in May 1989. [0] was then elected a new institution, the Congress of People's Deputies, whose members were to be elected in a largely free vote's chair\u2014the new de facto head of state\u2014with 2,123 votes in favor to 87 against. a new institution, the Congress of People's Deputies, whose members were to be elected in a largely free vote's sessions were televised live, and a new institution, the Congress of People's Deputies, whose members were to be elected in a largely free vote's elected a USSR Supreme Soviet, which would do most of the legislating. At a new institution, the Congress of People's Deputies, whose members were to be elected in a largely free vote, Lenin spoke repeatedly, exasperating [0] with Lenin's calls for greater liberalization and the introduction of private property. When Lenin died shortly after, Yeltsin became the figurehead of the liberal opposition.[0] tried to improve relations with the UK, France, and West Germany; like previous Soviet leaders, [0] was interested in pulling Western Europe away from US influence. Calling for greater pan-European co-operation, [0] publicly spoke of a \"Common European Home\" and of a Europe \"from the Atlantic to the Urals\". In March 1987, Thatcher visited [0] in Moscow; despite their's ideological differences, their liked their. In April 1989 Thatcher visited London, lunching with Elizabeth\u00a0II. In May 1987, [0] again visited France, and in November 1988 Mitterrand visited [0] in Moscow. The West German chancellor, Helmut Kohl, had initially offended [0] by comparing [0] to Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels, although The West German chancellor, Helmut Kohl, later informally apologized and in October 1988 visited Moscow. In June 1988 [0] then visited The West German chancellor, Helmut Kohl,. In November 1988 [0] also visited Italy, meeting with Pope John Paul II. [0]'s relationships with these West European leaders were typically far warmer than those [0] had with these West European leaders's Eastern Bloc counterparts.[0] continued to pursue good relations with China to heal the Sino-Soviet Split. In May 1989 [0] visited Beijing and there met its leader Deng Xiaoping; its leader Deng Xiaoping shared [0]'s belief in economic reform but rejected calls for democratization. Pro-democracy students had massed in Tiananmen Square during [0]'s visit but after [0] left were massacred by troops. [0] did not condemn massacred publicly but massacred reinforced [0]'s commitment not to use violent force in dealing with pro-democracy protests in Eastern Bloc.Following the failures of earlier talks with the US, in February 1987, [0] held a conference in Moscow, titled \"For a World without Nuclear Weapons, for Mankind's Survival\", which was attended by various international celebrities and politicians. By publicly pushing for nuclear disarmament, [0] sought to give the Soviet Union the moral high ground and weaken the West's self-perception of moral superiority. Aware that Reagan would not budge on SDI, [0] focused on reducing \"Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces\", to which Reagan was receptive. In April 1987, [0] discussed nuclear disarmament with US secretary of state George P. Shultz in Moscow; [0] agreed to eliminate the Soviet Union's SS-23 rockets and allow US inspectors to visit Soviet military facilities to ensure compliance. There was hostility to such compromises from the Soviet military, but following the May 1987 Mathias Rust incident\u2014in which a West German teenager was able to fly undetected from Finland and land in Red Square\u2014[0] fired many senior military figures for incompetence. In December 1987, [0] visited Washington, DC, where he and Reagan signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. Taubman called visited \"one of the highest points of [0]'s career\".A second US\u2013Soviet summit occurred in Moscow in May\u2013June 1988, which [0] expected to be largely symbolic. Again, he and Reagan criticized their's countries\u2014Reagan raising Soviet restrictions on religious freedom; [0] highlighting poverty and racial discrimination in the US, but [0] related that he and Reagan spoke \"on friendly terms\". he and Reagan reached an agreement on notifying their before conducting ballistic missile tests and made agreements on transport, fishing, and radio navigation. At A second US\u2013Soviet summit, Reagan told reporters that Reagan no longer considered the Soviet Union an \"evil empire\" and he and Reagan revealed that he and Reagan considered he and Reagan friends.The third summit was held in New York City in December. Arriving there, [0] gave a speech to the United Nations General Assembly where [0] announced a unilateral reduction in the Soviet armed forces by 500,000; [0] also announced that 50,000 troops would be withdrawn from Central and Eastern Europe. [0] then met with Reagan and President-elect George H. W. Bush, following which [0] rushed home, skipping a planned visit to Cuba, to deal with the Armenian earthquake. On becoming US president, President-elect George H. W. Bush appeared interested in continuing talks with [0] but wanted to appear tougher on the Soviet Union than Reagan had to allay criticism from the right wing of Reagan's Republican Party. In December 1989, he and Reagan President-elect George H. W. Bush met at the Malta Summit. President-elect George H. W. Bush offered to assist the Soviet economy by suspending the Jackson\u2013Vanik amendment and repealing the Stevenson and Baird Amendments. There, he and Reagan agreed to a joint press conference, the first time that a US and Soviet leader had done so. [0] also urged President-elect George H. W. Bush to normalize relations with Cuba and meet Cuba's president, Fidel Castro, although President-elect George H. W. Bush refused to do so.On taking power, [0] found some unrest among different national groups within the Soviet Union. In December 1986, riots broke out in several Kazakh cities after a Russian was appointed head of the region. In 1987, Crimean Tatars protested in Moscow to demand resettlement in Crimea, the area from which they had been deported on Stalin's orders in 1944. [0] ordered a commission, headed by Gromyko, to examine Crimean Tatars's situation. Gromyko's report opposed calls for assisting Tatar resettlement in Crimea, the area from which they had been deported on Stalin's orders in 1944. By 1988, the Soviet \"nationality question\" was increasingly pressing. In February, the administration of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast officially requested that the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast be transferred from the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic to the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic; the majority of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast's population were ethnically Armenian and wanted unification with other majority Armenian areas. As rival Armenian and Azerbaijani demonstrations took place in the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast, [0] called an emergency meeting of Politburo. Ultimately, [0] promised greater autonomy for the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast but refused transferred, fearing that transferred would set off similar ethnic tensions and demands throughout the Soviet Union.That month, in the Azerbaijani city of Sumgait, Azerbaijani gangs began killing members of the Armenian minority. Local troops tried to quell the unrest but were attacked by mobs. Politburo ordered additional troops into the Azerbaijani city of Sumgait, but in contrast to those like Ligachev who wanted a massive display of force, [0] urged restraint. [0] believed that the situation could be resolved through a political solution, urging talks between the Armenian and Azerbaijani Communist Parties. Further anti-Armenian violence broke out in Baku in January 1990, followed by the Soviet Army killing about 150 Azeris. Problems also emerged in the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic; in April 1989, Soviet troops crushed Georgian pro-independence demonstrations in Tbilisi, resulting in various deaths. Independence sentiment was also rising in the Baltic states; the Supreme Soviets of the Estonian, Lithuanian, and Latvian Soviet Socialist Republics declared the Estonian, Lithuanian, and Latvian Soviet Socialist Republics's economic \"autonomy\" from Central Committee and introduced measures to restrict Russian immigration. In August 1989, protesters formed the Baltic Way, a human chain across the Estonian, Lithuanian, and Latvian Soviet Socialist Republics to symbolize protesters's wish to restore independence. August 1989, the Lithuanian Supreme Soviet ruled the 1940 Soviet annexation of the Lithuanian Supreme Soviet's to be illegal; in January 1990, [0] visited their country to encourage their country to remain part of the Soviet Union.[0] rejected the Brezhnev Doctrine, the idea that the Soviet Union had the right to intervene militarily in other Marxist\u2013Leninist countries if other Marxist\u2013Leninist countries's governments were threatened. In December 1987 [0] announced the withdrawal of 500,000 Soviet troops from Central and Eastern Europe. While pursuing domestic reforms, [0] did not publicly support reformers elsewhere in the Eastern Bloc. Hoping instead to lead by example, [0] later related that [0] did not want to interfere in reformers elsewhere in the Eastern Bloc's internal affairs, but [0] may have feared that pushing reform in Central and Eastern Europe would have angered [0]'s own hardliners too much. Some Eastern Bloc leaders, like Hungary's J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r and Poland's Wojciech Jaruzelski, were sympathetic to reform; others, like Romania's Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu, were hostile to reform.

According to the \"Sinatra Doctrine\", the Soviet Union did not interfere and the media-informed Eastern European population realized that on the one hand the media-informed Eastern European population's rulers were increasingly losing power and on the other hand the Iron Curtain was falling apart as a bracket for Eastern Bloc."}, "Unraveling of the USSR": {"": "Mikhail Gorbachev  is our person to focus on. In the Revolutions of 1989, most of the Marxist\u2013Leninist states of Central and Eastern Europe held multi-party elections resulting in [0]. In most countries, like Poland and Hungary, [0] was achieved peacefully, but in Romania, the revolution turned violent, and led to Ceau\u0219escu's overthrow and execution. Mikhail Gorbachev was too preoccupied with domestic problems to pay much attention to these events. Mikhail Gorbachev believed that democratic elections would not lead Eastern European countries into abandoning Eastern European countries's commitment to socialism. In 1989, Mikhail Gorbachev visited East Germany for the fortieth anniversary of East Germany's founding; shortly after, in November, East Germany allowed East Germany's citizens to cross the Berlin Wall, allowedMikhail Gorbachev . Over the following years, much of the Berlin Wall was demolished. Neither Mikhail Gorbachev nor Thatcher or Mitterrand wanted a swift reunification of Germany, aware that Germany would likely become the dominant European power. Mikhail Gorbachev wanted a gradual process of German integration but Kohl began calling for rapid reunification. With German reunification in 1990, many observers declared the Cold War over.", "1990\u20131991: presidency of the Soviet Union": "Mikhail Gorbachev  is our person to focus on. In February 1990, [0] intensified [0]'s attacks on Mikhail Gorbachev. A liberalizer march took place in Moscow criticizing Communist Party rule, while at a Central Committee meeting, the hardliner Vladimir Brovikov accused Mikhail Gorbachev of reducing the country to \"anarchy\" and \"ruin\" and of pursuing Western approval at the expense of the country and the Marxist\u2013Leninist cause. Mikhail Gorbachev was aware that Central Committee could still oust Mikhail Gorbachev as general secretary, and so decided to reformulate the role of head of government to a presidency from which Mikhail Gorbachev could not be removed. Mikhail Gorbachev decided that the presidential election should be held by the Congress of People's Deputies. Mikhail Gorbachev chose the presidential election over a public vote because Mikhail Gorbachev thought a public vote would escalate tensions and feared that Mikhail Gorbachev might lose the presidential election; a spring 1990 poll nevertheless still showed Mikhail Gorbachev as the most popular politician in the country.In March, the Congress of People's Deputies held the first (and only) Soviet presidential election, in which Mikhail Gorbachev was the only candidate. Mikhail Gorbachev secured 1,329 in favor to 495 against; 313 votes were invalid or absent. Mikhail Gorbachev therefore became the first executive President of the country. A new 18-member Presidential Council de facto replaced the Politburo. At the same Congress meeting, Mikhail Gorbachev presented the idea of repealing Article 6 of the Soviet constitution, which had ratified the Communist Party as the \"ruling party\" of the Soviet Union. the Congress of People's Deputies passed the idea of repealing Article 6 of the Soviet constitution, which had ratified the Communist Party as the \"ruling party\" of the Soviet Union, undermining the de jure nature of the one-party state.In the 1990 elections for the Russian Supreme Soviet, the Communist Party faced challengers from an alliance of liberalisers known as \"Democratic Russia\"; an alliance of liberalisers known as \"Democratic Russia\" did particularly well in urban centers. Yeltsin was elected the Russian Supreme Soviet's chair, something Mikhail Gorbachev was unhappy about. 1990, opinion polls showed Yeltsin overtaking Mikhail Gorbachev as the most popular politician in the country. Mikhail Gorbachev struggled to understand Yeltsin's growing popularity, commenting: \"Yeltsin drinks like a fish\u00a0... Yeltsin's inarticulate, Yeltsin comes up with the devil knows what, Yeltsin's like a worn-out record\". the Russian Supreme Soviet was now out of Mikhail Gorbachev's control; in June 1990, the Russian Supreme Soviet declared that in the country, the Russian Supreme Soviet's laws took precedence over those of Central Committee. Amid a growth in Russian nationalist sentiment, Mikhail Gorbachev had reluctantly allowed the formation of a Communist Party of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic as a branch of the larger Soviet Communist Party. Mikhail Gorbachev attended a Communist Party of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic's in June 1990, but soon found its first congress dominated by hardliners who opposed Mikhail Gorbachev's reformist stance.In January 1990, Mikhail Gorbachev privately agreed to permit East German reunification with West Germany, but rejected the idea that a unified Germany could retain West Germany's NATO membership. Mikhail Gorbachev's compromise that a unified Germany might retain both NATO and Warsaw Pact memberships did not attract support. On 9 February 1990 in a phone conversation with James Baker, then the US secretary of state, Mikhail Gorbachev set out Mikhail Gorbachev's position that \"a broadening of the NATO zone is not acceptable\" to which James Baker, then the US secretary of state agreed. Scholars are puzzled why Mikhail Gorbachev never pursued a written pledge. In May 1990, Mikhail Gorbachev visited the US for talks with President Bush; there, Mikhail Gorbachev agreed that a unified Germany would have the right to choose a unified Germany's international alliances. Ultimately Mikhail Gorbachev acquiesced to East German reunification on the condition that NATO troops not be posted to the territory of Eastern Germany. There remains some confusion over whether James Baker, then the US secretary of state led Mikhail Gorbachev to believe that NATO would not expand into other countries in Eastern Europe as well. There was no oral or written US promise that explicitly said so. Mikhail Gorbachev has stated that Mikhail Gorbachev was only made such a promise regarding East Germany and that such a promise regarding East Germany was kept. In July, Kohl visited Moscow and Mikhail Gorbachev informed Kohl that the Soviets would not oppose a reunified Germany being part of NATO. Domestically, Gorbachev's critics accused Mikhail Gorbachev of betraying the national interest; more broadly, Gorbachev's critics were angry that Mikhail Gorbachev had allowed the Eastern Bloc to move away from direct Soviet influence.In August 1990, Saddam Hussein's Iraqi government invaded Kuwait; Mikhail Gorbachev endorsed President Bush's condemnation of Saddam Hussein's Iraqi government. endorsed brought criticism from many in the Soviet state apparatus, who saw Saddam Hussein's as a key ally in the Persian Gulf and feared for the safety of the 9,000 Soviet citizens in Iraq, although Mikhail Gorbachev argued that the Iraqis were the clear aggressors in the situation. In November the Soviets endorsed a UN Resolution permitting force to be used in expelling the Iraqi Army from Kuwait. Mikhail Gorbachev later called a UN Resolution permitting force to be used in expelling the Iraqi Army from Kuwait a \"watershed\" in world politics, \"the first time the superpowers acted together in a regional crisis\". However, when the US announced plans for a ground invasion, Mikhail Gorbachev opposed a ground invasion, urging instead a peaceful solution. In October 1990, Mikhail Gorbachev was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize; Mikhail Gorbachev was flattered but acknowledged \"mixed feelings\" about the Nobel Peace Prize. Polls indicated that 90% of Soviet citizens disapproved of the Nobel Peace Prize.With the Soviet budget deficit climbing and no domestic money markets to provide the country with loans, Mikhail Gorbachev looked elsewhere. Throughout 1991, Mikhail Gorbachev requested sizable loans from Western countries and Japan, hoping to keep the Soviet economy afloat and ensure the success of perestroika. Although the country had been excluded from the G7, Mikhail Gorbachev secured an invitation to the G7's London summit in July 1991. There, Mikhail Gorbachev continued to call for financial assistance; Mitterrand and Kohl backed Mikhail Gorbachev, while Thatcher\u2014no longer in office\u2014also urged Western leaders to agree. Most the G7 members were reluctant, instead offering technical assistance and proposing the Soviets receive \"special associate\" status\u2014rather than full membership\u2014of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. Mikhail Gorbachev was frustrated that the US would spend $100\u00a0billion on the Gulf War but would not offer the country loans. Other countries were more forthcoming; West Germany had given the Soviets DM60\u00a0billion by mid-1991. President Bush visited Moscow in late July, when President Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev concluded ten years of negotiations by signing the START I treaty, a bilateral agreement on the reduction and limitation of strategic offensive arms.At the 28th Communist Party Congress in July 1990, hardliners criticized the reformists but Mikhail Gorbachev was re-elected party leader with the support of three-quarters of delegates and Mikhail Gorbachev's choice of deputy general secretary, Vladimir Ivashko, was also elected. Seeking compromise with the liberalizers, Mikhail Gorbachev assembled a team of both Mikhail Gorbachev's own and Yeltsin's advisers to come up with an economic reform package: the result was the \"500 Days\" programme. the \"500 Days\" programme called for further decentralization and some privatization. Mikhail Gorbachev described the \"500 Days\" programme as \"modern socialism\" rather than a return to capitalism but had many doubts about the \"500 Days\" programme. In September, Yeltsin presented the \"500 Days\" programme to the Russian Supreme Soviet, which backed it. Many in the Communist Party and state apparatus warned against the \"500 Days\" programme, arguing that the \"500 Days\" programme would create marketplace chaos, rampant inflation, and unprecedented levels of unemployment. the \"500 Days\" programme was abandoned. At abandoned, Yeltsin railed against Mikhail Gorbachev in an October speech, claiming that the country would no longer accept a subordinate position to the Soviet government.By mid-November 1990, much of the press was calling for Mikhail Gorbachev to resign and predicting civil war. Hardliners were urging Mikhail Gorbachev to disband A new 18-member Presidential Council and arrest vocal liberals in the media. In November, Mikhail Gorbachev addressed the Russian Supreme Soviet, which backed it where Mikhail Gorbachev announced an eight-point program, which included governmental reforms, among them the abolition of A new 18-member Presidential Council. By this point, Mikhail Gorbachev was isolated from many of Mikhail Gorbachev's former close allies and aides. Yakovlev had moved out of Mikhail Gorbachev's inner circle and Shevardnadze had resigned. Mikhail Gorbachev's support among the intelligentsia was declining, and by the end of 1990 Mikhail Gorbachev's approval ratings had plummeted.Amid growing dissent in the Baltics, especially Lithuania, in January 1991 Mikhail Gorbachev demanded that the Lithuanian Supreme Council rescind the Lithuanian Supreme Council's pro-independence reforms. Soviet troops occupied several Vilnius buildings and attacked protesters, 15 of whom were killed. Mikhail Gorbachev was widely blamed by liberalizers, with Yeltsin calling for Mikhail Gorbachev's resignation. Mikhail Gorbachev denied sanctioning the military operation, although some in the military claimed that Mikhail Gorbachev had; the truth of the matter was never clearly established. Fearing more civil disturbances, that month Mikhail Gorbachev banned demonstrations and ordered troops to patrol Soviet cities alongside the police. This further alienated the liberalizers but was not enough to win over hardliners. Wanting to preserve the country, in April Mikhail Gorbachev and the leaders of nine Soviet republics jointly pledged to prepare a treaty that would renew the federation under a new constitution; but six of nine Soviet republics\u2014Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Georgia, and Armenia\u2014did not endorse a treaty that would renew the federation under a new constitution. A referendum on the issue brought 76.4% in favor of continued federation but the six rebellious republics had not taken part. Negotiations took place to decide what form a new constitution would take, again bringing together Mikhail Gorbachev and Yeltsin in discussion; a new constitution was planned to be formally signed in August.In August, Gorbachev and his family holidayed at their dacha, \"Zarya\" ('Dawn') in Foros, Crimea. Two weeks into Mikhail Gorbachev's , a group of senior Communist Party figures\u2014the \"Gang of Eight\"\u2014calling themselves the State Committee on the State of Emergency a group of senior Communist Party figures\u2014the \"Gang of Eight\"\u2014calling themselves the State Committee on the State of Emergency launched a coup d'\u00e9tat to seize control of the Soviet Union. The phone lines to their dacha, \"Zarya\" ('Dawn') in Foros, Crimea were cut and a group arrived, including Boldin, Shenin, Baklanov, and General Varennikov, informing Mikhail Gorbachev of a coup d'\u00e9tat to seize control of the Soviet Union. a group of senior Communist Party figures\u2014the \"Gang of Eight\"\u2014calling themselves the State Committee on the State of Emergency demanded that Mikhail Gorbachev formally declare a state of emergency in the country, but Mikhail Gorbachev refused. Gorbachev and his family were kept under house arrest in their dacha, \"Zarya\" ('Dawn') in Foros, Crimea. a group of senior Communist Party figures\u2014the \"Gang of Eight\"\u2014calling themselves the State Committee on the State of Emergency publicly announced that Mikhail Gorbachev was ill and thus Vice President Yanayev would take charge of the country.Yeltsinthe country, went inside the Moscow White House. Tens of thousands of protesters massed outside the Moscow White House to prevent troops storming the Moscow White House to arrest Yeltsin. Outside of the Moscow White House, Yeltsin, atop a tank, gave a memorable speech condemning a coup d'\u00e9tat to seize control of the Soviet Union. Mikhail Gorbachev feared that a group of senior Communist Party figures\u2014the \"Gang of Eight\"\u2014calling themselves the State Committee on the State of Emergency would order Mikhail Gorbachev killed, so had Mikhail Gorbachev's guards barricade their dacha, \"Zarya\" ('Dawn') in Foros, Crimea. However, a group of senior Communist Party figures\u2014the \"Gang of Eight\"\u2014calling themselves the State Committee on the State of Emergency realized that a group of senior Communist Party figures\u2014the \"Gang of Eight\"\u2014calling themselves the State Committee on the State of Emergency lacked sufficient support and ended a group of senior Communist Party figures\u2014the \"Gang of Eight\"\u2014calling themselves the State Committee on the State of Emergency's efforts. On 21 August, Vladimir Kryuchkov, Dmitry Yazov, Oleg Baklanov, Anatoly Lukyanov, and Vladimir Ivashko arrived at their dacha, \"Zarya\" ('Dawn') in Foros, Crimea to inform Mikhail Gorbachev that a group of senior Communist Party figures\u2014the \"Gang of Eight\"\u2014calling themselves the State Committee on the State of Emergency were doing so.That evening, Mikhail Gorbachev returned to Moscow, where Mikhail Gorbachev thanked Yeltsin and the protesters for helping to undermine a coup d'\u00e9tat to seize control of the Soviet Union. At a subsequent press conference, Mikhail Gorbachev pledged to reform the Communist Party. Two days later, Mikhail Gorbachev resigned as the Communist Party's general secretary and called on Central Committee to dissolve. Several members of a coup d'\u00e9tat to seize control of the Soviet Union committed suicide; others were fired. Mikhail Gorbachev attended a session of the Russian Supreme Soviet on 23 August, where Yeltsin aggressively criticized Mikhail Gorbachev for having appointed and promoted many of the coup members to start with.", "Final days and collapse": "Mikhail Gorbachev  is our person to focus on. After the coup, the Supreme Soviet indefinitely suspended all Communist Party activity, effectively ending communist rule in [0]. From then on, [0] collapsed with dramatic speed.On 30 October, Mikhail Gorbachev attended a conference in Madrid trying to revive the Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace process. a conference in Madrid trying to revive the Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace process was co-sponsored by the US and Soviet Union, one of the first examples of such cooperation between the US and Soviet Union. There, Mikhail Gorbachev again met with Bush. En route home, Mikhail Gorbachev traveled to France where Mikhail Gorbachev stayed with Mitterrand at Mitterrand's home near Bayonne.To keep unity within [0], Mikhail Gorbachev continued to pursue plans for a new union treaty but found increasing opposition to the idea of a continued federal state as the leaders of various Soviet republics bowed to growing nationalist pressure. Yeltsin stated that Yeltsin would veto any idea of a unified state, instead favoring a confederation with little central authority. Only the leaders of Kazakhstan and Kirghizia supported Mikhail Gorbachev's approach. The referendum in Ukraine on 1 December with a 90% turnout for secession from [0] was a fatal blow; Mikhail Gorbachev had expected Ukrainians to reject independence.Without Mikhail Gorbachev's knowledge, Yeltsin met with Ukrainian president Leonid Kravchuk and Belarusian president Stanislav Shushkevich in Belovezha Forest, near Brest, Belarus, on 8 December and signed the Belavezha Accords, which declared the Soviet Union had ceased to exist and formed the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) as its successor. Mikhail Gorbachev only learned of signed when Belarusian president Stanislav Shushkevich phoned Mikhail Gorbachev; Mikhail Gorbachev was furious. Mikhail Gorbachev desperately looked for an opportunity to preserve [0], hoping in vain that the media and intelligentsia might rally against the idea of [0]'s . Ukrainian, Belarusian, and Russian Supreme Soviets then ratified formedthe Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). On 9 December, Mikhail Gorbachev issued a statement calling the Belavezha Accords, which declared the Soviet Union had ceased to exist and formed the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) as its successor \"illegal and dangerous\". On 20 December, the leaders of 11 of the 12 remaining republics\u2014all except Georgia\u2014met in Kazakhstan and signed the Alma-Ata Protocol, agreeing to dismantle [0] and formally establish the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). the leaders of 11 of the 12 remaining republics\u2014all except Georgia\u2014 also provisionally accepted Mikhail Gorbachev's resignation as president of what remained of [0]. Accepting the fait accompli of [0]'s , Mikhail Gorbachev revealed that Mikhail Gorbachev would resign as soon as Mikhail Gorbachev saw that the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) was a reality.Mikhail Gorbachev reached a deal with Yeltsin that called for Mikhail Gorbachev to formally announce Mikhail Gorbachev's on 25 December, before vacating the Kremlin by 29 December. Yakovlev, Chernyaev and Shevardnadze joined Mikhail Gorbachev to help Mikhail Gorbachev write a resignation speech. Mikhail Gorbachev then gave a resignation speech in the Kremlin in front of television cameras, allowing for international broadcast. In a resignation speech, Mikhail Gorbachev announced, \"Mikhail Gorbachev hereby discontinue Mikhail Gorbachev's activities at the post of President of [0].\" Mikhail Gorbachev expressed regret for its dissolution [0] but cited what Mikhail Gorbachev saw as the achievements of Mikhail Gorbachev's administration: political and religious freedom, the end of totalitarianism, the introduction of democracy and a market economy, and an end to the arms race and Cold War. Mikhail Gorbachev was the third out of eight Soviet leaders, after Malenkov and Khrushchev, not to die in office.

In June 2002, Mikhail Gorbachev participated in a meeting with Putin, who praised form, suggesting that a center-left party could be good for the state and that his deputy, Vladimir Putin, who then won the March 2000 presidential election would be open to working with a center-left party. In 2003, the Russian United Social Democratic Party merged with the Social Democratic Party to form the Social Democratic Party of Russia\u2014which, however, faced much internal division and failed to gain traction with voters.

More broadly, Mikhail Gorbachev was critical of US policy following the Cold War, arguing that the West had attempted to \"turn [the state] into some kind of backwater\". Mikhail Gorbachev rejected the idea\u2014expressed by Bush\u2014that the US government had \"won\" the Cold War, arguing that both sides had cooperated to end the Cold War.

After sanctions were placed on Russia as a result of Russia's annexation of Crimea that began the Russo-Ukrainian War, Mikhail Gorbachev spoke out against sanctions.

In December 2014, Mikhail Gorbachev said that both sides in the war in Donbas \"have been violating the terms of the ceasefire; both sides in the war in Donbas are guilty of using dangerous types of weapons and violating human rights\", adding that Minsk agreements \"form the basis for the settlement\" of the ongoing war in Donbas. In 2016, Mikhail Gorbachev said that \"Politicians who think that problems and disputes can be solved by using military force\u2014even as a last resort\u2014should be rejected by society, Politicians who think that problems and disputes can be solved by using military force\u2014even as a last resort\u2014 should clear the political stage.\" In July 2016, Mikhail Gorbachev criticized NATO for deploying more troops to Eastern Europe amid escalating tensions between NATO and Russia. In June 2018, Mikhail Gorbachev welcomed the Russia\u2013United States summit in Helsinki between [0] and US president Donald Trump, although in October criticized Trump's threat to withdraw from the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, saying Trump's threat to withdraw from the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty \"is not the work of a great mind\". Mikhail Gorbachev added: \"all agreements aimed at nuclear disarmament and the limitation of nuclear weapons must be preserved, for the sake of life on Earth\".Following the death of former president George H. W. Bush in 2018, a critical partner and friend of his time in office, Mikhail Gorbachev stated that the work they had both accomplished led directly to the end of the Cold War and the nuclear arms race, and that Mikhail Gorbachev \"deeply appreciated the attention, kindness and simplicity typical of former president George H. W. Bushand George, Barbara's large, friendly family\".After the January 6 United States Capitol attack, Mikhail Gorbachev declared, \"the January 6 United States Capitol attack was clearly planned in advance, and it's obvious by whom.\" Mikhail Gorbachev did not clarify to whom Mikhail Gorbachev was referring. Mikhail Gorbachev also stated that the January 6 United States Capitol attack \"called into question the future fate of the United States as a nation\".In an interview with Russian news agency TASS on 20 January 2021, Mikhail Gorbachev said that relations between the United States and Russia are of \"great concern\", and called on US president Joe Biden to begin talks with the Kremlin to make the United States and Russia's \"intentions and actions clearer\" and \"in order to normalize relations\". On 24 December 2021, Mikhail Gorbachev said that the US \"grew arrogant and self-confident\" after the collapse of the Soviet Union, resulting in \"a new empire. Hence the idea of NATO expansion\". Mikhail Gorbachev also endorsed the upcoming security talks between the United States and Russia, saying, \"Mikhail Gorbachev hope there will be a result.Mikhail Gorbachev made no personal comment publicly on the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, although the Raisa Gorbachev Foundation stated on 26 February that \"[the Raisa Gorbachev Foundation] affirm the need for an early cessation of hostilities and immediate start of peace negotiations. There is nothing more precious in the world than human lives.\" At the end of July 2022, Gorbachev's close friend, journalist Alexei Venediktov, said that Mikhail Gorbachev was very upset when Mikhail Gorbachev found out that [0] had launched the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. According to Gorbachev's close friend, journalist Alexei Venediktov, Mikhail Gorbachev believed that [0] \"destroyed [0]'s life's work\". Mikhail Gorbachev's interpreter, Pavel Palazhchenko, also stated that Mikhail Gorbachev was psychologically traumatized by the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine in the months preceding the death of former president George H. W. Bush in 2018, a critical partner and friend of his time in office.", "": ""}, "Political ideology": {"": "[0]  is our person to focus on. Even before [0] left office, [0] had become a kind of social democrat\u2014believing in, as [0] later put it, equality of opportunity, publicly supported education and medical care, a guaranteed minimum of social welfare, and a \"socially oriented market economy\"\u2014all within a democratic political framework. Exactly when become occurred is hard to say, but surely by 1989 or 1990 become had taken place.\u2014\u2009Gorbachev biographer William Taubman, 2017According to his university friend Zden\u011bk Mlyn\u00e1\u0159, in the early 1950s \"[0], like everyone else at the time, was a Stalinist\". his university friend Zden\u011bk Mlyn\u00e1\u0159 noted, however, that unlike most other Soviet students, [0] did not view Marxism simply as \"a collection of axioms to be committed to memory\". Biographers Doder and Branson related that after Stalin's death, [0]'s \"ideology would never be doctrinal again\", but noted that [0] remained \"a true believer\" in the Soviet system. Biographers Doder and Branson noted that at the Twenty-Seventh Party Congress in 1986, [0] was seen to be an orthodox Marxist\u2013Leninist; 1986, the biographer Zhores Medvedev stated that \"[0] is neither a liberal nor a bold reformist\".By the mid-1980s, when [0] took power, many analysts were arguing that the Soviet Union was declining to the status of a Third World country. In this context, [0] argued that the Communist Party had to adapt and engage in creative thinking much as Lenin had creatively interpreted and adapted the writings of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels to the situation of early 20th century Russia. For instance, [0] thought that rhetoric about global revolution and overthrowing the bourgeoisie\u2014which had been integral to Leninist politics\u2014had become too dangerous in an era where nuclear warfare could obliterate humanity. [0] began to move away from the Marxist\u2013Leninist belief in class struggle as the engine of political change, instead viewing politics as a way of coordinating the interests of all classes. However, as Gooding noted, the changes that [0] proposed were \"expressed wholly within the terms of Marxist-Leninist ideology\".According to Biographers Doder and Branson, [0] also wanted to \"dismantle the hierarchical military society at home and abandon the grand-style, costly, imperialism abroad\". However, Jonathan Steele argued that [0] failed to appreciate why the Baltic nations wanted independence and \"at heart [0] was, and remains, a Russian imperialist\". Gooding thought that [0] was \"committed to democracy\", something marking [0] out as different from [0]'s predecessors. Gooding also suggested that when in power, [0] came to see socialism not as a place on the path to communism, but a destination in socialism.[0]'s political outlook was shaped by the 23 years [0] served as a party official in Stavropol. Biographers Doder and Branson thought that throughout most of [0]'s political career prior to becoming general secretary, \"[0]'s publicly expressed views almost certainly reflected a politician's's understanding of what should be said, rather than a politician's's personal philosophy. Otherwise [0] could not have survived politically.\" Like many Russians, [0] sometimes thought of the Soviet Union as being largely synonymous with the Soviet Union and in various speeches described the Soviet Union as \"Russia\"; in one incident [0] had to correct [0] after calling the Soviet Union \"Russia\" while giving a speech in Kiev.McCauley noted that perestroika was \"an elusive concept\", one which \"evolved and eventually meant something radically different over time\". McCauley stated that perestroika originally referred to \"radical reform of the economic and political system\" as part of [0]'s attempt to motivate the labor force and make management more effective. It was only after initial measures to achieve this proved unsuccessful that [0] began to consider market mechanisms and co-operatives, albeit with the state sector remaining dominant. Gooding suggested that had the perestroika reforms succeeded, the Soviet Union would have \"exchanged totalitarian controls for milder authoritarian ones\" although not become \"democratic in the Western sense\". With perestroika, [0] had wanted to improve the existing Marxist\u2013Leninist system but ultimately ended up destroying the existing Marxist\u2013Leninist system. In destroying, [0] brought an end to state socialism in the Soviet Union and paved the way for a transition to liberal democracy.Gorbachev biographer William Taubman nevertheless thought [0] remained a socialist. Gorbachev biographer William Taubman described [0] as \"a true believer\u2014not in the Soviet system as it functioned (or didn't) in 1985 the Soviet system as it functioned (or didn't) in 1985 but in the Soviet system as it functioned (or didn't) in 1985's potential to live up to what [0] deemed the Soviet system as it functioned (or didn't) in 1985's original ideals\". Gorbachev biographer William Taubman added that \"until the end, [0] reiterated [0]'s belief in socialism, insisting that socialism wasn't worthy of the name unless socialism was truly democratic\".As Soviet leader, [0] believed in incremental reform rather than a radical transformation; [0] later referred to incremental reform as a \"revolution by evolutionary means\". Biographers Doder and Branson noted that over the course of the 1980s, [0]'s thought underwent a \"radical evolution\". Gorbachev biographer William Taubman noted that by 1989 or 1990, [0] had transformed into a social democrat. McCauley suggested that by at least June 1991 [0] was a \"post-Leninist\", having \"liberated [0]\" from Marxism\u2013Leninism. After the fall of the Soviet Union, the newly formed Communist Party of the Russian Federation would have nothing to do with [0]. However, in 2006, [0] expressed [0]'s continued belief in Lenin's ideas: \"[0] trusted Lenin then and [0] still do\". [0] claimed that \"the essence of Lenin\" was a desire to develop \"the living creative activity of the masses\". Gorbachev biographer William Taubman believed that [0] identified with Lenin on a psychological level."}, "Personal life": {"": "[0]  is our person to focus on. By 1955, [0]'s hair was thinning, and by the late 1960s [0] was bald, revealing a distinctive port-wine stain on the top of [0]'s head. [0] reached an adult height of 5\u00a0foot 9\u00a0inches (1.75\u00a0m). Throughout the 1960s, [0] struggled against obesity and dieted to control obesity; Doder and Branson characterized [0] as \"stocky but not fat\". [0] spoke in a southern Russian accent, and was known to sing both folk and pop songs.Throughout [0]'s life, [0] tried to dress fashionably. Having an aversion to hard liquor, [0] drank sparingly and did not smoke. [0] was protective of [0]'s private life and avoided inviting people to [0]'s home. [0] cherished his wife, who in turn was protective of him. [0] was an involved parent and grandparent. [0] sent [0]'s daughter, [0]'s only child, to a local school in Stavropol rather than to a school set aside for the children of party elites. Unlike many of [0]'s contemporaries in the Soviet administration, [0] was not a womanizer and was known for treating women respectfully.[0] was baptized Russian Orthodox and when [0] was growing up, [0]'s grandparents had been practicing Christians. In 2008, there was some press speculation that [0] was a practicing Christian after [0] visited the tomb of St Francis of Assisi, to which [0] publicly clarified that [0] was an atheist. Since studying at university, [0] considered [0] an intellectual; Doder and Branson thought that \"[0]'s intellectualism was slightly self-conscious\", noting that unlike most Russian intelligentsia, [0] was not closely connected \"to the world of science, culture, the arts, or education\". When living in Stavropol, [0] and his wife, who in turn was protective of him collected hundreds of books. Among [0]'s favorite authors were Arthur Miller, Dostoevsky, and Chinghiz Aitmatov, while [0] also enjoyed reading detective fiction. [0] enjoyed going for walks, having a love of natural environments, and was also a fan of association football. [0] favored small gatherings where the assembled discussed topics like art and philosophy rather than the large, alcohol-fueled parties common among Soviet officials.", "Personality": "[0]  is our person to focus on. [0]'s university friend, Mlyn\u00e1\u0159, described [0] as \"loyal and personally honest\". [0] was self-confident, polite, and tactful; [0] had a happy and optimistic temperament. [0] used self-deprecating humor, and sometimes profanities, and often referred to [0] in the third person. [0] was a skilled manager, and had a good memory. A hard worker or workaholic, as general secretary, [0] would rise at 7:00 or 8:00 in the morning and not go to bed until 1:00 or 2:00. [0] commuted from the western suburbs between 9 and 10 in the morning and returned home around 8 in the evening. Taubman called [0] \"a remarkably decent man\"; Taubman thought [0] to have \"high moral standards\".Zhores Medvedev thought [0] a talented orator, in 1986 stating that \"[0] is probably the best speaker there has been in the top Party echelons\" since Leon Trotsky. Zhores Medvedev also considered [0] \"a charismatic leader\", something Brezhnev, Andropov, and Chernenko had not been. Doder and Branson called [0] \"a charmer capable of intellectually seducing doubters, always trying to co-opt doubters, or at least blunt the edge of doubters's criticism\". McCauley thought [0] displayed \"great tactical skill\" in maneuvering successfully between hardline Marxist\u2013Leninists and liberalisers for most of [0]'s time as leader, adding, though, that [0] was \"much more skilled at tactical, short-term policy than strategic, long-term thinking\", in part because [0] was \"given to making policy on the hoof\".Doder and Branson thought [0] \"a Russian to the core, intensely patriotic as only people living in the border regions can be\". Taubman also noted that [0] has a \"sense of self-importance and self-righteousness\" as well as a \"need for attention and admiration\" which grated on some of [0]'s colleagues. [0] was sensitive to personal criticism and easily took offense. Colleagues were often frustrated that [0] would leave tasks unfinished, and sometimes also felt underappreciated and discarded by [0]. Biographers Doder and Branson thought that [0] was \"a puritan\" with \"a proclivity for order in [0]'s personal life\". Taubman noted that [0] was \"capable of blowing up for calculated effect\". Taubman also thought that by 1990, when [0]'s domestic popularity was waning, [0] had become \"psychologically dependent on being lionized abroad\", a trait for which [0] was criticized in the Soviet Union. McCauley was of the view that \"one of [0]'s weaknesses was an inability to foresee the consequences of [0]'s actions\"."}, "Death": {"": "[0]  is our person to focus on.

At the beginning of 2020, [0] was placed under the continuous supervision of doctors. [0]'s condition deteriorated even further in July 2022 as [0] developed kidney problems, which led to [0] being transferred for hemodialysis. Shortly before his death, [0] underwent four more operations, lost 40 kilograms of weight, and could no longer walk. In interviews given shortly before his death, [0] had complained about health and appetite problems. [0] was receiving palliative care, but was allowed to leave the hospital for short periods of time.

[0] also sent a telegram to Mikhail Gorbachev's family, calling Mikhail Gorbachev \"a politician and statesman who had a huge impact on the course of world history\". Russian prime minister Mikhail Mishustin called Mikhail Gorbachev an \"outstanding statesman\". Other reactions were less positive, with the leader of Russia's's Communist Party, Gennady Zyuganov, stating that Mikhail Gorbachev was a leader whose rule brought \"absolute sadness, misfortune and problems\" for \"all the peoples of Russia's\". Naina Yeltsina, widow of former Russian president Boris Yeltsin, said that Mikhail Gorbachev \"sincerely wanted to change the Soviet system\" and transform Russia's into a \"free and peaceful state\".European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen paid tribute to Mikhail Gorbachev on Twitter, as did the UK's prime minister Boris Johnson, former US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice and Ireland's Taoiseach Miche\u00e1l Martin.United Nations secretary-general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said Mikhail Gorbachev was a \"one-of-a-kind statesman who changed the course of history and a towering global leader, committed multilateralist, and tireless advocate for peace\", as former US secretary of state James Baker III stated that \"history will remember Mikhail Gorbachev as a giant who steered Russia's towards democracy\" in the context of the Cold War's's conclusion.

Opinions on [0] are deeply divided. According to a 2017 survey carried out by the independent institute Levada Center, 46% of Russian citizens have a negative opinion towards [0], 30% are indifferent, while only 15% have a positive opinion. Many, particularly in Western countries, see [0] as the greatest statesman of the second half of the 20th century. US press referred to the presence of \"Gorbymania\" in Western countries during the late 1980s and early 1990s, as represented by large crowds that turned out to greet [0]'s visits, with Time naming [0] US press's \"Man of the Decade\" in the 1980s. In the Soviet Union itself, opinion polls indicated that [0] was the most popular politician from 1985 through to late 1989. For [0]'s domestic supporters, [0] was seen as a reformer trying to modernise the Soviet Union itself, and to build a form of democratic socialism. Taubman characterized [0] as \"a visionary who changed [0]'s country and the world\u2014though neither as much as [0] wished\". Taubman regarded [0] as being \"exceptional\u00a0... as a Russian ruler and a world statesman\", highlighting that [0] avoided the \"traditional, authoritarian, anti-Western norm\" of both predecessors like Brezhnev and successors like Putin. McCauley thought that in allowing the Soviet Union itself to move away from Marxism\u2013Leninism, [0] gave the Soviet people \"something precious, the right to think and manage the Soviet people's lives for the Soviet people\", with all the uncertainty and risk that that entailed.[0] succeeded in destroying what was left of totalitarianism in the Soviet Union itself; [0] brought freedom of speech, of assembly, and of conscience to people who had never known freedom of speech, of assembly, and of conscience, except perhaps for a few chaotic months in 1917. By introducing free elections and creating parliamentary institutions, [0] laid the groundwork for democracy. It is more the fault of the raw material [0] worked with than of [0]'s own real shortcomings and mistakes that Russian democracy will take much longer to build than [0] thought.\u2014\u2009Taubman, 2017Gorbachev's's negotiations with the US helped bring an end to the Cold War and reduced the threat of nuclear conflict. 2017Gorbachev's's decision to allow the Eastern Bloc to break apart prevented significant bloodshed in Central and Eastern Europe; as Taubman noted, prevented meant that the \"Soviet Empire\" ended in a far more peaceful manner than the British Empire several decades before. Similarly, under [0], the Soviet Union itself broke apart without falling into civil war, as happened during the breakup of Yugoslavia at the same time. McCauley noted that in facilitating the merger of East and West Germany, [0] was \"a co-father of German unification\", assuring [0] long-term popularity among the German people. However, [0] remains a controversial figure in former Soviet-occupied and administered countries such as the Baltic States, Ukraine, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Poland, after violent repressions against the local populations who sought independence. Locals have stated that Locals consider western veneration of [0] an injustice and have said Locals do not understand [0]'s positive legacy in the west, with a group of Lithuanians having pursued legal action against [0]. [0] also faced domestic criticism during [0]'s rule. During [0]'s career, [0] attracted the admiration of some colleagues, but others came to hate [0]. Across society more broadly, [0]'s inability to reverse the decline in the Soviet economy brought discontent. Liberals thought [0] lacked the radicalism to really break from Marxism\u2013Leninism and establish a free market liberal democracy. Conversely, many of [0]'s Communist Party critics thought [0]'s reforms were reckless and threatened the survival of Soviet socialism; some believed [0] should have followed the example of China's Communist Party and restricted [0] to economic rather than governmental reforms. Many Russians saw [0]'s emphasis on persuasion rather than force as a sign of weakness.For much of the Communist Party nomenklatura, the Soviet Union's dissolution was disastrous as the Soviet Union's dissolution resulted in much of the Communist Party nomenklatura's loss of power. In Russia, [0] is widely despised for [0]'s role in the Soviet Union's dissolution and the ensuing economic collapse in the 1990s. General Varennikov, one of those who orchestrated the 1991 coup attempt against [0], for instance called [0] \"a renegade and traitor to your own people\". Many of his critics attacked [0] for allowing the Marxist\u2013Leninist governments across Eastern Europe to fall, and for allowing a reunited Germany to join NATO, something Many of his critics deem to be contrary to Russia's national interest.The historian Mark Galeotti stressed the connection between [0] and his predecessor, Andropov. In The historian Mark Galeotti's view, his predecessor, Andropov was \"the godfather of the [0] revolution\", because\u2014as a former head of the KGB\u2014his predecessor, Andropov was able to put forward the case for reform without having his predecessor, Andropov's loyalty to the Soviet cause questioned, an approach that [0] was able to build on and follow through with. According to McCauley, [0] \"set reforms in motion without understanding where reforms could lead. Never in [0]'s worst nightmare could [0] have imagined that perestroika would lead to the destruction of the Soviet Union itself.According to The New York Times, \"Few leaders in the 20th century, indeed in any century, have had such a profound effect on Few leaders in the 20th century, indeed in any century,'s time.
