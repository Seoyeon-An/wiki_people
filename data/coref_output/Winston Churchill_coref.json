In October, [0] travelled to the conflict zone near Ladysmith, then besieged by Boer troops, before heading for Colenso.

As a free trader, [0] took part in the foundation of the Free Food League. [0] sensed that the animosity of many party members would prevent [0] from gaining a Cabinet position under a Conservative government. The Liberal Party was then attracting growing support, and so [0]'s defection in 1904 may also have been influenced by personal ambition. [0] increasingly voted with The Liberal Party against the Conservative government. For example, [0] opposed an increase in military expenditure; [0] supported a Liberal bill to restore legal rights to trade unions; and [0] opposed the introduction of tariffs on goods imported into the British Empire, describing [0] as a \"sober admirer\" of the principles of free trade. the Conservative government announced protectionist legislation in October 1903.

[0] supported giving women the vote, but [0] would only back a bill to that effect if a bill to that effect had majority support from the (male) electorate. His proposed solution was a referendum on the issue, but His proposed solution found no favour with Asquith and women's suffrage remained unresolved until 1918. Many suffragettes believed that [0] was a committed opponent of women's suffrage, and targeted [0]'s meetings for protest. In November 1910, the suffragist Hugh Franklin attacked [0] with a whip; the suffragist Hugh Franklin was arrested and imprisoned for six weeks.In November 1910, [0] had to deal with the Tonypandy riots, in which coal miners in the Rhondda Valley violently protested against their working conditions.

Privately, [0] regarded both the mine owners and striking miners as being \"very unreasonable\". The Times and other media outlets accused [0] of being too soft on the protesters; in contrast, many in the Labour Party, which was linked to the trade unions, regarded [0] as having been too heavy-handed. In consequence of the latter, [0] incurred the long-term suspicion of the labour movement.Asquith called a general election in December 1910 and the Liberals were re-elected with [0] secure in Dundee.

After a house in the East End of London, which was surrounded by police caught fire, [0] told the fire brigade not to proceed into a house in the East End of London, which was surrounded by police because of the threat posed by three Latvian burglars. Afterwards, two of three Latvian burglars were found dead.

[0] supported the Home Rule Bill and urged Ulster Unionists to accept the Home Rule Bill as [0] opposed the partition of Ireland. Concerning the possibility of the partition of Ireland, [0] stated: \"Whatever Ulster's's right may be, Ulster's cannot stand in the way of the whole of the rest of Ireland.

Approval was given and, in March 1915, an Anglo-French task force attempted a naval bombardment of Turkish defences in the Dardanelles. In April, the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force, including the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC), began the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force, including the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC),'s assault at Gallipoli. Both campaigns failed and [0] was held by many MPs, particularly Conservatives, to be personally responsible.In May, Asquith agreed under parliamentary pressure to form an all-party coalition government, but the Conservatives' one condition of entry was that [0] must be removed from the Admiralty.

After the Allies failed to prevent the German occupation of Norway, the Commons held [0] from 7 to 9 May on the government's's conduct of the war.

On the second day (Wednesday, 8 May), the Labour opposition called for a division which was in effect a vote of no confidence in Chamberlain's government. There was considerable support for Winston Churchill on both sides of the Commons but, as a member of the government's, Winston Churchill was obliged to speak on the government's's behalf. Winston Churchill was called upon to wind up the debate, which placed Winston Churchill in the difficult position of having to defend the government's without damaging Winston Churchill's own prestige. Although the government's won a division which was in effect a vote of no confidence in Chamberlain's government, the government's's majority was drastically reduced amid calls for a national government to be formed.In the early hours of 10 May, German forces invaded Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands as a prelude to German forces's assault on France. Since a division which was in effect a vote of no confidence in Chamberlain's government, Chamberlain's had been trying to form a coalition but the Labour opposition declared on the Friday afternoon that the Labour opposition would not serve under Chamberlain's's leadership, although the Labour opposition would accept another Conservative. The only two candidates were Winston Churchill and Lord Halifax, the Foreign Secretary. The matter had already been discussed at a meeting on the 9th between Chamberlain's, Lord Halifax, the Foreign Secretary, Winston Churchill, and David Margesson, the government Chief Whip. Lord Halifax, the Foreign Secretary admitted that Lord Halifax, the Foreign Secretary could not govern effectively as a member of the Commons and so Chamberlain's advised the King to send for Winston Churchill.

By that time, [0] had won the doubters over and [0]'s succession as party leader was a formality.[0] began [0]'s premiership by forming a five-man war cabinet which included Chamberlain as Lord President of the Council, Labour leader Clement Attlee as Lord Privy Seal (later as Deputy Prime Minister), Halifax as Foreign Secretary and Labour's Arthur Greenwood as a minister without portfolio. In practice, these five were augmented by the service chiefs and ministers who attended the majority of meetings. The cabinet changed in size and membership as the war progressed, one of the key appointments being the leading trades unionist Ernest Bevin as Minister of Labour and National Service. In response to previous criticisms that there had been no clear single minister in charge of the prosecution of the war, [0] created and assumed the additional position of Minister of Defence, making [0] the most powerful wartime Prime Minister in British history. [0] drafted outside experts into government to fulfil vital functions, especially on the Home Front. outside experts included personal friends like Lord Beaverbrook and Frederick Lindemann, who became government's scientific advisor.At the end of May, with the British Expeditionary Force in retreat to Dunkirk and the Fall of France seemingly imminent, Halifax proposed that government should explore the possibility of a negotiated peace settlement using the still-neutral Mussolini as an intermediary. There were several high-level meetings from 26 to 28 May, including two with the French premier Paul Reynaud.

In time, [0] turned a speech impediment into an asset and could use a speech impediment to great effect, as when [0] called Hitler a \"Nar-zee\" (rhymes with \"khazi\"; emphasis on the \"z\"), rather than a Nazi (\"ts\").His first speech as Prime Minister, delivered to the Commons on 13 May was the \"blood, toil, tears and sweat\" speech. the \"blood, toil, tears and sweat\" speech was little more than a short statement but, Jenkins says, \"the \"blood, toil, tears and sweat\" speech included phrases which have reverberated down the decades\". [0] made it plain to the nation that a long, hard road lay ahead and that victory was the final goal:[0] would say to the House... that [0] have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat.

Operation Dynamo, the evacuation of 338,226 Allied servicemen from Dunkirk, ended on Tuesday, 4 June when the French rearguard surrendered. surrendered was far in excess of expectations and surrendered gave rise to a popular view that Dunkirk had been a miracle, and even a victory. [0] referred to \"a miracle of deliverance\" in [0]'s \"we shall fight on the beaches\" speech to the Commons that afternoon, though [0] shortly reminded everyone that: \"We must be very careful not to assign to this deliverance the attributes of a victory. Wars are not won by evacuations\". the \"blood, toil, tears and sweat\" speech ended on a note of defiance coupled with a clear appeal to the United States:We shall go on to the end. We shall fight in France, We shall fight on the seas and oceans, We shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air. We shall defend We's , whatever the cost may be. We shall fight on the beaches, We shall fight on the landing grounds, We shall fight in the fields and in the streets, We shall fight in the hills. We shall never surrender, and even if, which [0] do not for a moment believe, France or a large part of France were subjugated and starving, then We's Empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the British Fleet, would carry on the struggle, until, in God's good time, the New World, with all its power and mightthe New World, with all its power and might's , steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of France. Germany initiated Fall Rot the following day and Italy entered the war on the 10th. The Wehrmacht occupied Paris on the 14th and completed The Wehrmacht's conquest of France on 25 June. It was now inevitable that Hitler would attack and probably try to invade Great Britain. Faced with this, [0] addressed the Commons on 18 June and delivered one of [0]'s most famous speeches, ending with this peroration:What General Weygand called the \"Battle of France\" is over. [0] expect that the Battle of Great Britain is about to begin. Hitler knows that Hitler will have to break us in France or lose the war. Let us therefore brace us to us's duty and so bear us that if the British Commonwealth and Empire lasts for a thousand years, men will still say: \"This was men's finest hour\". [0] was determined to fight back and ordered the commencement of the Western Desert campaign on 11 June, an immediate response to the Italian declaration of war. the Western Desert campaign went well at first while the Italian army was the sole opposition and Operation Compass was a noted success. In early 1941, however, the still-neutral Mussolini requested German support and Hitler sent the Afrika Korps to Tripoli under the command of Generalleutnant Erwin Rommel, who arrived not long after [0] had halted Operation Compass so that [0] could reassign forces to Greece where the Balkans campaign was entering a critical phase.In other initiatives through June and July 1940, [0] ordered the formation of both the Special Operations Executive (SOE) and the Commandos. the Special Operations Executive (SOE) was ordered to promote and execute subversive activity in Nazi-occupied Europe while the Commandos were charged with raids on specific military targets there. Hugh Dalton, the Minister of Economic Warfare, took political responsibility for the Special Operations Executive (SOE) and recorded in Hugh Dalton, the Minister of Economic Warfare,'s diary that [0] told Hugh Dalton, the Minister of Economic Warfare,: \"And now go and set Nazi-occupied Europe ablaze\".On 20 August 1940, at the height of the \"Battle of France\", [0] addressed the Commons to outline the war situation. In the middle of addressed, [0] made a statement that created a famous nickname for the RAF fighter pilots involved in the battle:The gratitude of every home in our's Island, in our's Empire, and indeed throughout the world, except in the abodes of the guilty, goes out to the British airmen who, undaunted by odds, unwearied in the RAF fighter pilots involved in the battle's constant challenge and mortal danger, are turning the tide of the war by the RAF fighter pilots involved in the battle's prowess and by the RAF fighter pilots involved in the battle's devotion. Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few. The Luftwaffe altered The Luftwaffe's strategy from 7 September 1940 and began the Blitz, which was especially intensive through October and November. [0]'s morale during the Blitz, which was especially intensive through October and November was generally high and [0] told his private secretary John Colville in November that [0] thought the threat of invasion was past. [0] was confident that Great Britain could hold Great Britain's own, given the increase in output, but was realistic about Great Britain's chances of actually winning the war without American intervention.In September 1940, the British and American governments concluded the Destroyers for Bases Agreement, by which fifty American destroyers were transferred to the Royal Navy in exchange for free US base rights in Bermuda, the Caribbean and Newfoundland. An added advantage for Great Britain was that Great Britain's military assets in free US base rights in Bermuda, the Caribbean and Newfoundland could be redeployed elsewhere.[0]'s good relations with United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt helped secure vital food, oil and munitions via the North Atlantic shipping routes. It was for this reason that [0] was relieved when United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt was re-elected in 1940. Upon re-election, United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt set about implementing a new method of providing necessities to Great Britain without the need for monetary payment. United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt persuaded Congress that repayment for providing would take the form of defending the nation. a new method of providing necessities to Great Britain without the need for monetary payment was known as Lend-Lease and a new method of providing necessities to Great Britain without the need for monetary payment was formally enacted on 11 March Hitler launched his invasion of the Soviet Union on Sunday, 22 June 1941. It was no surprise to Churchill, who had known since early April, from Enigma decrypts at Bletchley Park, that his invasion of the Soviet Union was imminent. [0] had tried to warn General Secretary Joseph Stalin via the British ambassador to Moscow, Stafford Cripps, but to no avail as General Secretary Joseph Stalin did not trust [0]. The night before his invasion of the Soviet Union, already intending an address to the nation, [0] alluded to [0]'s hitherto anti-communist views by saying to his private secretary John Colville: \"If Hitler invaded Hell, [0] would at least make a favourable reference to the Devil\".In August 1941, [0] made [0]'s first transatlantic crossing of the war on board HMS\u00a0Prince of Wales and met United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt in Placentia Bay, Newfoundland. On 14 August, they issued the joint statement that has become known as the Atlantic Charter. the joint statement that has become known as the Atlantic Charter outlined the goals of the British and American governments for the future of the world and the joint statement that has become known as the Atlantic Charter is seen as the inspiration for the 1942 Declaration by United Nations, itself the basis of the United Nations which was founded in June 1945.", "Pearl Harbor to D-Day: December 1941 to June 1944": "[0] is our person to focus on. On 7\u20138 December 1941, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor was followed by their's invasion of Malaya and, on the 8th, [0] declared war on their. With the hope of using Irish ports for counter submarine operations, [0] sent a telegram to the Irish Prime Minister (the 8th in which [0] obliquely offers Irish unity: \"Now is the Irish Prime Minister's chance. Now or never! A nation once again! [0] will meet the Irish Prime Minister wherever the Irish Prime Minister wish.\" No meeting took place between the two prime ministers and there is no record of a response from the Irish Prime Minister Three days later came the joint declaration of war by Germany and Italy against the United States. [0] went to Washington later in the month to meet Roosevelt for the first Washington Conference (codename Arcadia). the first Washington Conference (codename Arcadia) was important for \"Europe First\", the decision to prioritise victory in Europe over victory in the Pacific, taken by Roosevelt while [0] was still in mid-Atlantic. The Americans agreed with [0] that Hitler was the main enemy and that the defeat of Germany was key to Allied success. It was also agreed that the first joint Anglo-American strike would be Operation Torch, the invasion of French North Africa (i.e., Algeria and Morocco). Originally planned for the spring of 1942, the first joint Anglo-American strike was finally launched in November 1942 when the crucial Second Battle of El Alamein was already underway.On 26 December, [0] addressed a joint meeting of the US Congress but, that night, [0] suffered a mild heart attack which was diagnosed by [0]'s physician, Sir Charles Wilson (later Lord Moran), as a coronary deficiency needing several weeks' bed rest. [0] insisted that [0] did not need bed rest and, two days later, journeyed on to Ottawa by train where [0] gave a speech to the Canadian Parliament that included the \"some chicken, some neck\" line in which [0] recalled French predictions in 1940 that \"Britain alone would have Britain alone's neck wrung like a chicken\". [0] arrived home in mid-January, having flown from Bermuda to Plymouth in a Boeing 314 Clipper (the first transatlantic air crossing by a head of government), to find that there was a crisis of confidence in both [0]'s coalition government and [0], and [0] decided to face a vote of confidence in the Commons, which [0] won easily.While [0] was away, the Eighth Army, having already relieved the Siege of Tobruk, had pursued Operation Crusader against Rommel's forces in Libya, successfully driving Rommel's forces in Libya back to a defensive position at El Agheila in Cyrenaica. On 21 January 1942, however, Rommel's launched a surprise counter-attack which drove the Allies back to Gazala.Elsewhere, recent British success in the Battle of the Atlantic was compromised by the Kriegsmarine's's introduction of the Kriegsmarine's's M4 4-rotor Enigma, whose signals could not be deciphered by Bletchley Park for nearly a year. In the Far East, the news was much worse with Japanese advances in all theatres, especially at sea and in Malaya. At a press conference in Washington, [0] had to play down [0]'s increasing doubts about the security of Singapore.[0] already had grave concerns about the fighting quality of British troops after the defeats in Norway, France, Greece and Crete. Following the fall of Singapore to the Japanese on 15 February 1942, [0] felt that grave concerns about the fighting quality of British troops were confirmed and said: \"(the fall of Singapore to the Japanese on 15 February 1942 is) the worst disaster and largest capitulation in British military history\". More bad news had come on 11 February as the Kriegsmarine's pulled off the Kriegsmarine's's audacious \"Channel Dash\", a massive blow to British naval prestige. The combined effect of these events was to sink Churchill's morale to Churchill's morale's lowest point of the whole war.Meanwhile, the Japanese had occupied most of Burma by the end of April 1942. Counter-offensives were hampered by the monsoon season and by disordered conditions in Bengal and Bihar, as well as a severe cyclone which devastated Bengal and Bihar in October 1942. A combination of factors, including the curtailment of essential rice imports from Burma, poor administration, wartime inflation and a series of large-scale natural disasters such as flooding and crop disease led to the Bengal famine of 1943, in which an estimated 2.1\u20133.8 million people died. From December 1942 onwards, food shortages had prompted senior officials in India to ask London for grain imports, although the colonial authorities failed to recognise the seriousness of the emerging famine and responded ineptly. Churchill's government was criticised for refusing to approve more imports, refusingChurchill's government . When Churchill's government realised the full extent of the emerging famine in September 1943, [0] ordered the transportation of 130,000 tons of Iraqi and Australian grain to Bengal and the war cabinet agreed to send 200,000 tons by the end of 1943. During the last quarter of 1943, 100,000 tons of rice and 176,000 tons of wheat were imported, compared to averages of 55,000 tons of rice and 54,000 tons of wheat earlier in 1943. In October, [0] wrote to the newly appointed Viceroy of India, Lord Wavell, charging the newly appointed Viceroy of India, Lord Wavell with the responsibility of ending the emerging famine. In February 1944, as preparation for Operation Overlord placed greater demands on Allied shipping, [0] cabled the newly appointed Viceroy of India, Lord Wavell saying: \"[0] will certainly help the newly appointed Viceroy of India, Lord Wavell all [0] can, but the newly appointed Viceroy of India, Lord Wavell must not ask the impossible\". Grain shipment requests continued to be turned down by Churchill's government throughout 1944, and the newly appointed Viceroy of India, Lord Wavell complained to [0] in October that \"the vital problems of India are being treated by Churchill's government with neglect, even sometimes with hostility and contempt\". The relative impact of British policies on the death toll of the emerging famine remains a matter of controversy among scholars.On 20 May 1942, the Soviet Foreign Affairs minister, Vyacheslav Molotov, arrived in London and stayed until the 28th before going on to Washington. The purpose of this visit was to sign a treaty of friendship but the Soviet Foreign Affairs minister, Vyacheslav Molotov, wanted sign done on the basis of certain territorial concessions regarding Poland and the Baltic countries. [0] and Eden worked for a compromise and eventually a twenty-year treaty was formalised but with the question of frontiers placed on hold. the Soviet Foreign Affairs minister, Vyacheslav Molotov, was also seeking a Second Front in Europe but all [0] could do was confirm that preparations were in progress and make no promises on a date.[0] felt well pleased with these negotiations and said as much when [0] contacted Roosevelt on the 27th. The previous day, however, Rommel's had launched Rommel's's counter-offensive, Operation Venice, to begin the Battle of Gazala. The Allies were ultimately driven out of Libya and suffered a major defeat in the fall of Tobruk on 21 June. [0] was with Roosevelt when the news of Tobruk reached [0]. [0] was shocked by the surrender of 35,000 troops which was, apart from Singapore, \"the heaviest blow\" [0] received in the whole war. The Axis advance was eventually halted at the First Battle of El Alamein in July and the Battle of Alam el Halfa in early September. Both sides were exhausted and in urgent need of reinforcements and supplies.[0] had returned to Washington on 17 June. He and Roosevelt agreed on the implementation of Operation Torch, the invasion of French North Africa (i.e., Algeria and Morocco) as the necessary precursor to an invasion of Europe. Roosevelt had appointed General Dwight D. Eisenhower as commanding officer of the European Theater of Operations, United States Army (ETOUSA). Having received the news from North Africa, [0] obtained shipment from the United States to the Eighth Army of 300 Sherman tanks and 100 howitzers. [0] returned to Britain alone on 25 June and had to face another motion of no confidence, this time in [0]'s central direction of the whole war, but again [0] won easily.In August, despite health concerns, [0] visited the British forces in North Africa, raising morale in the process, en route to Moscow for [0]'s first meeting with Stalin. [0] was accompanied by Roosevelt's special envoy Averell Harriman. [0] was in Moscow 12\u201316 August and had four lengthy meetings with Stalin. Although He and Roosevelt got along quite well together on a personal level, there was little chance of any real progress given the state of the whole war with the Germans still advancing in all theatres. Stalin was desperate for The Allies to open the Second Front in Europe, as [0] had discussed with the Soviet Foreign Affairs minister, Vyacheslav Molotov, in May, and the answer was the same.While [0] was in Cairo in early August, [0] decided to appoint Field Marshal Alexander as Field Marshal Auchinleck's successor as Commander-in-Chief of the Middle East Theatre. Command of the Eighth Army was given to General William Gott but General William Gott was shot down and killed while flying to Cairo, only three days later and General Montgomery succeeded General William Gott. [0] returned to Cairo from Moscow on 17 August and could see for [0] that the Alexander/General Montgomery combination was already having an effect. [0] returned to Britain alone on the 21st, nine days before Rommel's launched Rommel's's final offensive.As 1942 drew to a close, the tide of war began to turn with Allied victory in the key battles of El Alamein and Stalingrad. Until November, The Allies had always been on the defensive, but from November, the Germans were. [0] ordered the church bells to be rung throughout Britain alone for the first time since early 1940. On 10 November, knowing that El Alamein was a victory, [0] delivered one of [0]'s most memorable war speeches to the Lord Mayor's Luncheon at the Mansion House in London, in response to the Allied victory at El Alamein: \"the Allied victory at El Alamein is not the end. the Allied victory at El Alamein is not even the beginning of the end. But the Allied victory at El Alamein is, perhaps, the end of the beginning\".In January 1943, [0] met Roosevelt at the first Washington Conference (codename Arcadia). the first Washington Conference (codename Arcadia) was also attended by General Charles de Gaulle on behalf of the Free French Forces. Stalin had hoped to attend but declined because of the situation at Stalingrad. Although [0] expressed doubts on the matter, the so-called Casablanca Declaration committed The Allies to securing \"unconditional surrender\" by the Axis powers. From Morocco, [0] went to Cairo, Adana, Cyprus, Cairo again and Algiers for various purposes. [0] arrived home on 7 February having been out of the country for nearly a month. [0] addressed the Commons on the 11th and then became seriously ill with pneumonia the following day, necessitating more than one month of rest, recuperation and convalescence \u2013 for convalescence, [0] moved to Chequers. [0] returned to work in London on 15 March.[0] made two transatlantic crossings during 1943, meeting Roosevelt at both the third Washington Conference (codename Trident) in May and the first Quebec Conference (codename Quadrant) in August. In November, He and Roosevelt met Chinese Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek at the Cairo Conference (codename Sextant).The most important conference of 1943 was soon afterwards (28 November to 1 December) at Tehran (codename Eureka), where He and Roosevelt met Stalin in the first of the \"Big Three\" meetings, preceding those at Yalta and Potsdam in 1945. Roosevelt and Stalin co-operated in persuading [0] to commit to the opening of a second front in western Europe and it was also agreed that Germany would be divided after the whole war, but no firm decisions were made about how. On He and Roosevelt's way back from Tehran (codename Eureka), He and Roosevelt held a second Cairo conference with Turkish president \u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc, but were unable to gain any commitment from Turkey to join The Allies.[0] went from Cairo to Tunis, arriving on 10 December, initially as Eisenhower's's guest (soon afterwards, Eisenhower's took over as Supreme Allied Commander of the new SHAEF just being created in London). While [0] was in Tunis, [0] became seriously ill with atrial fibrillation and was forced to remain until after Christmas while a succession of specialists was drafted in to ensure [0]'s recovery. Clementine and Colville arrived to keep [0] company; Colville had just returned to Downing Street after more than two years in the RAF. On 27 December, the party went on to Marrakesh for convalescence. Feeling much better, [0] flew to Gibraltar on 14 January 1944 and sailed home on the King George V. [0] was back in London on the morning of 18 January and surprised MPs by attending Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons that afternoon. Since 12 January 1943, when [0] set off for the first Washington Conference (codename Arcadia), [0] had been abroad or seriously ill for 203 of the 371 days.In the autumn of 1942, after [0]'s meeting with Stalin in Moscow, [0] was approached by Eisenhower's, commanding the North African Theater of Operations, United States Army (NATOUSA), and [0]'s aides on the subject of where The Allies should launch The Allies's first strike in Europe. According to General Mark Clark, who later commanded the United States Fifth Army in the Italian campaign, The Americans openly admitted that a cross-Channel operation in the near future was \"utterly impossible\". As an alternative, [0] recommended \"slit(ting) the soft belly of the Mediterranean\" and persuaded The Americans to invade first Sicily and then Italy after The Americans had defeated the Afrika Korps in North Africa. After the whole war, General Mark Clark, who later commanded the United States Fifth Army in the Italian campaign still agreed that [0]'s analysis was correct, but General Mark Clark, who later commanded the United States Fifth Army in the Italian campaign added that, when The Americans landed at Salerno, The Americans found that Italy was \"a tough old gut\".invade Sicily began on 9 July and was successfully completed by 17 August. [0] was then all for driving straight up the Italian mainland with Rome as the main target, but The Americans wanted to withdraw several divisions to Britain alone in the build-up of forces for Operation Overlord. [0] was still not keen on Operation Overlord as [0] feared that an Anglo-American army in France might not be a match for the fighting efficiency of the Wehrmacht. [0] preferred peripheral operations, including a plan called Operation Jupiter for an invasion of northern Norway. Events in Sicily had an unexpected impact in Italy. King Victor Emmanuel sacked Mussolini on 25 July and appointed Marshal Badoglio as Prime Minister. Marshal Badoglio opened negotiations with The Allies which resulted in the Armistice of Cassibile on 3 September. In response, the Germans activated Operation Achse and took control of most of Italy. Although [0] still preferred Italy to Normandy as The Allies's main route into the Third Reich, [0] was deeply concerned about the strong German resistance at Salerno and, later, after The Allies successfully gained The Allies's bridgehead at Anzio but still failed to break the stalemate, [0] caustically said that instead of \"hurling a wildcat onto the shore\", the Allied force had become a \"stranded whale\".  The big obstacle was Monte Cassino and Monte Cassino was not until mid-May 1944 when The big obstacle was finally overcome, enabling The Allies to at last advance on Rome.The difficulties in Italy caused [0] to have a change of heart and mind about Allied strategy to the extent that, when the Anzio stalemate developed soon after [0]'s return to Britain alone from North Africa, [0] threw [0] into the planning of Operation Overlord and set up an ongoing series of meetings with SHAEF and the British Chiefs of Staff over which he regularly presided. an ongoing series of meetings with SHAEF and the British Chiefs of Staff over which he regularly presided were always attended by either Eisenhower's or Eisenhower's's chief of staff General Walter Bedell Smith. [0] was especially taken by the Mulberry project but [0] was also keen to make the most of Allied air power which, by the beginning of 1944, had become overwhelming. [0] never fully lost [0]'s apprehension about Operation Overlord, however, and underwent great fluctuation of mood as D-Day approached. Jenkins says that [0] faced potential victory with much less buoyancy than when [0] defiantly faced the prospect of defeat four years earlier.[0] could not ignore the need for post-war reforms covering a broad sweep of areas such as agriculture, education, employment, health, housing and welfare. The Beveridge Report with its five \"Giant Evils\" The Beveridge Report with its five \"Giant Evils\"'s was published in November 1942 and assumed great importance amid widespread popular acclaim. Even so, [0] was not really interested because [0] was focused on winning the whole war and saw reform in terms of tidying up afterwards. [0]'s attitude was demonstrated in a Sunday evening radio broadcast on 26 March 1944. [0] was obliged to devote most of a Sunday evening radio broadcast on 26 March 1944 to the subject of reform and showed a distinct lack of interest. In their respective diaries, Colville said [0] had broadcast \"indifferently\" and Harold Nicolson said that, to many people, [0] came across the air as \"a worn and petulant old man\".In the end, however, it was the population's demand for reform that decided the 1945 general election. Labour was perceived as the party that would deliver The Beveridge Report with its five \"Giant Evils\". Arthur Greenwood had initiated The Beveridge Report with its five \"Giant Evils\"'s preceding social insurance and allied services inquiry in June 1941. Attlee, Bevin and Labour's other coalition ministers through the whole war were seen to be working towards reform and earned the trust of the electorate.", "Defeat of Germany: June 1944 to May 1945": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was determined to be actively involved in the Normandy invasion and hoped to cross the Channel on D-Day itself (6 June 1944) D-Day itself (6 June 1944) or at least on D-Day+1. [0]'s desire caused unnecessary consternation at SHAEF until [0] was effectively vetoed by the King who told [0] that, as head of all three services, he (the King) ought to go too. [0] expected an Allied death toll of 20,000 on D-Day itself (6 June 1944) but [0] was proven to be pessimistic because less than 8,000 died in the whole of June. [0] made [0]'s first visit to Normandy on 12 June to visit Montgomery, whose HQ was then about five miles inland. That evening, as [0] was returning to London, the first V-1 flying bombs were launched. In a longer visit to Normandy on 22\u201323 July, [0] went to Cherbourg and Arromanches where [0] saw the Mulberry Harbour.[0] met Roosevelt at the Second Quebec Conference (codename Octagon) from 12 to 16 September 1944. Between themselves, themselves reached agreement on the Morgenthau Plan for the Allied occupation of Germany after the war, the intention of which was not only to demilitarise but also de-industrialise Germany. Eden strongly opposed the Morgenthau Plan for the Allied occupation of Germany after the war, the intention of which was not only to demilitarise but also de-industrialise Germany and was later able to persuade [0] to disown the Morgenthau Plan for the Allied occupation of Germany after the war, the intention of which was not only to demilitarise but also de-industrialise Germany. US Secretary of State Cordell Hull also opposed the Morgenthau Plan for the Allied occupation of Germany after the war, the intention of which was not only to demilitarise but also de-industrialise Germany and convinced Roosevelt that the Morgenthau Plan for the Allied occupation of Germany after the war, the intention of which was not only to demilitarise but also de-industrialise Germany was infeasible.At the fourth Moscow conference (codename Tolstoy) from 9 to 19 October 1944, Churchill and Eden met Stalin and Molotov. the fourth Moscow conference (codename Tolstoy) from 9 to 19 October 1944 has gained notoriety for the so-called \"Percentages agreement\" in which Churchill and Stalin effectively agreed the post-war fate of the Balkans. By that time, the Soviet armies were in Rumania and Bulgaria. [0] suggested a scale of predominance throughout Rumania and Bulgaria so as not to, as [0] put it, \"get at cross-purposes in small ways\". [0] wrote down some suggested percentages of influence per country and gave some suggested percentages of influence per country to Stalinsome suggested percentages of influence per country. the so-called \"Percentages agreement\" in which Churchill and Stalin effectively agreed the post-war fate of the Balkans was that Russia would have 90% control of Romania and 75% control of Bulgaria. The United Kingdom and the United States would have 90% control of Greece. Hungary and Yugoslavia would be 50% each. In 1958, five years after the account of the fourth Moscow conference (codename Tolstoy) from 9 to 19 October 1944 was published (in [0]'s The Second World War), Soviet authorities denied that Stalin had accepted such an \"imperialist proposal\".From 30 January to 2 February 1945, Churchill and Eden met for Churchill and Eden's Malta Conference ahead of the second \"Big Three\" event at Yalta from 4 to 11 February. Yalta had massive implications for the post-war world. There were two predominant issues: the question of setting up the United Nations Organisation after the war, on which much progress was made; and the more vexed question of Poland's's post-war status, which [0] saw as a test case for the future of Eastern Europe. [0] faced some strong criticism for the Yalta agreement on Poland's. For example, 27 Tory MPs voted against [0] when the matter was debated in the Commons at the end of the month. Jenkins, however, maintains that [0] did as well as [0] could have done in very difficult circumstances, not least the fact that Roosevelt was seriously ill and could not provide [0] with meaningful support.Another outcome of Yalta was the so-called Operation Keelhaul. The Western Allies agreed to the forcible repatriation of all Soviet citizens in the Allied zones, including prisoners of war, to the Soviet Union and the policy was later extended to all Eastern European refugees, many of whom were anti-Communist. the so-called Operation Keelhaul was implemented between 14 August 1946 and 9 May 1947.On the nights of 13\u201315 February 1945, some 1,200 British and US bombers attacked the German city of Dresden, which was crowded with wounded and refugees from the Eastern Front. attacked were part of an area bombing campaign that was initiated by [0] in January with the intention of shortening the war. [0] came to regret attacked because initial reports suggested an excessive number of civilian casualties close to the end of the war, though an independent commission in 2010 confirmed a death toll between 22,700 and 25,000. On 28 March, [0] decided to restrict area bombing and sent a memorandum to General Ismay for the Chiefs of Staff Committee:The destruction of the German city of Dresden, which was crowded with wounded and refugees from the Eastern Front remains a serious query against the conduct of Allied bombing..... [0] feel the need for more precise concentration upon military objectives..... rather than on mere acts of terror and wanton destruction, however impressive. British historian Frederick Taylor has pointed out that the number of Soviet citizens who died from German bombing was roughly equivalent to the number of German citizens who died from Allied raids. Jenkins asks if [0] was moved more by foreboding than by regret but admits it is easy to criticise with the hindsight of victory. Jenkins adds that the area bombing campaign was no more reprehensible than President Truman's use of the second atomic bomb on Nagasaki six months later. Andrew Marr, quoting Max Hastings, says that a memorandum was a \"calculated political attempt..... to distance [0]..... from the rising controversy surrounding the area offensive\".On 7 May 1945 at the SHAEF headquarters in Reims the Allies accepted Germany's surrender. The next day was Victory in Europe Day (VE Day) when [0] broadcast to the nation that Germany had surrendered and that a final ceasefire on all fronts in Europe would come into effect at one minute past midnight that night (i.e., on 9 May). Afterwards, [0] went to Buckingham Palace where [0] appeared on the balcony with the Royal Family before a huge crowd of celebrating citizens. [0] went from Buckingham Palace to Whitehall where [0] addressed another large crowd: \"God bless another large crowd. This is another large crowd's victory. In our's long history, our have never seen a greater day than This. Everyone, man or woman, has done Everyone, man or woman's best\".At this point [0] asked Ernest Bevin to come forward and share the applause. Ernest Bevin said: \"No, [0], This is [0]'s day\", and proceeded to conduct another large crowd in the singing of For He's a Jolly Good Fellow. In the evening, [0] made another broadcast to the nation asserting that the defeat of Japan would follow in the coming months (the Japanese surrendered on 15 August 1945).In 1945, [0] commissioned the Chiefs of Staff Committee to provide the Chiefs of Staff Committee's thoughts on a possible military campaign against the USSR, code-named Operation Unthinkable. One plan involved a surprise attack on Soviet troops stationed in Germany in order to impose \"the will of the United States and the British Empire\" on the Soviets. The hypothetical start date for the Allied invasion of Soviet-held Europe was set for 1 July 1945.", "Caretaker government: May 1945 to July 1945": "[0] is our person to focus on. With a general election looming (there had been none for almost a decade), and with the Labour ministers refusing to continue the wartime coalition, [0] resigned as Prime Minister on 23 May 1945. Later 23 May 1945, [0] accepted the King's invitation to form a new government, known officially as the National Government, like the Conservative-dominated coalition of the 1930s, but sometimes called the caretaker ministry. a new government, known officially as the National Government, like the Conservative-dominated coalition of the 1930s, but sometimes called the caretaker ministry contained Conservatives, National Liberals and a few non-party figures such as Sir John Anderson and Lord Woolton, but not Labour or Archibald Sinclair's Official Liberals. Although [0] continued to carry out the functions of Prime Minister, including exchanging messages with the US administration about the upcoming Potsdam Conference, [0] was not formally reappointed until 28 May.[0] was Great Britain's's representative at the upcoming Potsdam Conference when the upcoming Potsdam Conference opened on 17 July and was accompanied at the upcoming Potsdam Conference's sessions not only by Eden as Foreign Secretary but also, pending the result of the July general election, by Attlee. They attended nine sessions in nine days before returning to England for They's election counts. After the landslide Labour victory, Attlee returned with Bevin as the new Foreign Secretary and there were a further five days of discussion. the upcoming Potsdam Conference went badly for [0]. Eden as Foreign Secretary later described [0]'s performance as \"appalling\", saying that [0] was unprepared and verbose. [0] upset the Chinese, exasperated the Americans and was easily led by Stalin, whom [0] was supposed to be resisting.[0] mishandled the election campaign by resorting to party politics and trying to denigrate Labour. On 4 June, [0] committed a serious political gaffe by a serious political gaffe in a radio broadcast that a Labour government would require \"some form of Gestapo\" to enforce a Labour government's agenda. a serious political gaffe backfired badly and Attlee made political capital by saying in Attlee's reply broadcast next day: \"The voice we heard last night was that of [0], but the mind was that of Lord Beaverbrook\". Jenkins says that a radio broadcast was \"the making of Attlee.Although polling day was 5 July, the result of the July general election did not become known until 26 July, owing to the need to collect the votes of those serving overseas. Clementine and daughter Mary had been at the count in Woodford, Churchill's new constituency in Essex, and had returned to Downing Street to meet [0] for lunch. [0] was unopposed by the major parties in Woodford, Churchill's new constituency in Essex, but [0]'s majority over a sole independent candidate was much less than expected. [0] now anticipated defeat by Labour and Clementine and daughter Mary later described lunch as \"an occasion of Stygian gloom\". To Clementine's suggestion that election defeat might be \"a blessing in disguise\", [0] retorted: \"At the moment election defeat seems very effectively disguised\".That afternoon Churchill's doctor Lord Moran (so [0] later recorded in Churchill's doctor Lord Moran's book The Struggle for Survival) commiserated with [0] on the \"ingratitude\" of the British public, to which [0] replied: \"[0] wouldn't call the \"ingratitude\" of the British public that. the British public have had a very hard time\". Having lost a general election, despite enjoying much personal support amongst the British public, [0] resigned as Prime Minister that evening and was succeeded by Attlee. Many reasons have been given for [0]'s , key among Many reasons being that a desire for post-war reform was widespread amongst the British public and that [0] Great Britain's was not seen as the man to lead Great Britain's in peace. Although the Conservative Party was unpopular, many electors appear to have wanted [0] to continue as Prime Minister whatever the outcome, or to have wrongly believed that continue would be possible.", "": ""}, "Leader of the Opposition: 1945\u20131951": {"\"Iron Curtain\" speech": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] continued to lead the Conservative Party and, for six years, served as Leader of the Opposition. In 1946, [0] was in America for nearly three months from early January to late March. It was on this trip that [0] gave [0]'s \"Iron Curtain\" speech about the USSR and the USSR's creation of the Eastern Bloc. Speaking on 5 March 1946 in the company of President Truman at Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri, [0] declared:From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic, an Iron Curtain has descended across the continent. Behind an Iron Curtain lie all the capitals of the ancient states of Central and Eastern Europe. Warsaw, Berlin, Prague, Vienna, Budapest, Belgrade, Bucharest and Sofia, all the capitals of the ancient states of Central and Eastern Europe and the populations around all the capitals of the ancient states of Central and Eastern Europe lie in what [0] must call the Soviet sphere. The essence of [0]'s view was that, though the USSR did not want war with the western Allies, the USSR's entrenched position in Eastern Europe had made it impossible for the three great powers to provide the world with a \"triangular leadership\". [0]'s desire was much closer collaboration between Britain and America. Within Speaking, [0] called for \"a special relationship between the British Commonwealth and Empire and America\", but [0] emphasised the need for co-operation within the framework of the United Nations Charter.", "Politics": "[0] is our person to focus on.

As a minister in 1913 and again in 1921, [0] suggested that Ulster should be part of a united Ireland, but with a degree of autonomy from an independent Irish government. [0] was always opposed on this by Ulster Unionists. While [0] was Leader of the Opposition, [0] told John W. Dulanty and Frederick Boland, successive Irish ambassadors to London, that [0] still hoped for reunification.Labour won the 1950 general election, but with a much-reduced majority.

[0] was nearly 77 when [0] took office and was not in good health following several minor strokes. By December 1951, George\u00a0VI had become concerned about [0]'s decline and intended asking [0] to stand down in favour of Eden, but George\u00a0VI had George\u00a0VI's own serious health issues and died on 6 February 1952 without making asking.

[0] wanted US military support of British interests in Egypt and the Middle East, but wanted was refused. While Truman expected British military involvement in Korea, Truman viewed any US commitment to the Middle East as maintaining British imperialism. The Americans recognised that the British Empire was in terminal decline and had welcomed the Attlee government's policy of decolonisation. [0] believed that Britain's position as a world power depended on the British Empire's continued existence.[0] had been obliged to recognise Colonel Nasser's's revolutionary government of Egypt, which took power in 1952. Much to [0]'s private dismay, agreement was reached in October 1954 on the phased evacuation of British troops from British troops's Suez base. In addition, Britain agreed to terminate Britain's rule in Anglo-Egyptian Sudan by 1956, though terminate was in return for Colonel Nasser's's abandonment of Egyptian claims over Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. Elsewhere, the Malayan Emergency, a guerrilla war fought by Communist fighters against Commonwealth forces, had begun in 1948 and continued past Malayan independence (1957) until 1960. Britain maintained the military response to the Malayan Emergency, a guerrilla war fought by Communist fighters against Commonwealth forces, and adopted a similar strategy for the Mau Mau Uprising in British Kenya (1952\u20131960).Churchill was uneasy about the election of Eisenhower as Truman's successor. After Stalin died on 5 March 1953, [0] sought a summit meeting with the Soviets but Eisenhower refused out of fear that the Soviets would use a summit meeting with the Soviets for propaganda. By July of 1953, [0] was deeply regretting that the Democrats had not been returned. [0] told Colville that Eisenhower as president was \"both weak and stupid\". [0] believed that Eisenhower did not fully comprehend the danger posed by the H-bomb and [0] greatly distrusted Eisenhower's Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles. [0] hosted Eisenhower to no avail at the Three-Powers Bermuda Conference (with French Prime Minister Joseph Laniel being the third participant) in December 1953; they met again in June/July 1954 at the White House.

Although publicly supportive, [0] was privately scathing about Eden's handling of the Suez Crisis and Clementine believed that many of [0]'s visits to the United States in the following years were attempts to help repair Anglo-American relations. After leaving the premiership, [0] remained an MP until [0] stood down at the 1964 general election. Apart from 1922 to 1924, [0] had been an MP since October 1900 and had represented five constituencies.By the time of the 1959 general election, [0] seldom attended the House of Commons. Despite the Conservative landslide in 1959, [0]'s own majority in Woodford fell by more than 1000.

Like the Duke of Wellington in 1852 and William Gladstone in 1898, [0] was given a state funeral. Planning for a state funeral had begun in 1953 under the code-name of \"Operation Hope Not\" and a detailed plan had been produced by 1958. His coffin lay in state at Westminster Hall for three days and the funeral ceremony was at St Paul's Cathedral on 30 January. Afterwards, His coffin was taken by boat along the River Thames to Waterloo Station and from there by a special train to the family plot at St Martin's Church, Bladon, near [0]'s birthplace at Blenheim Palace.Worldwide, numerous memorials have been dedicated to [0].

[0] was a prolific writer. [0]'s output included a novel (Savrola), two biographies, three volumes of memoirs, several histories, and numerous press articles. Two of [0]'s most famous works, published after [0]'s first premiership brought [0]'s international fame to new heights, were [0]'s six-volume memoir, The Second World War, and the four-volume A History of the English-Speaking Peoples. In recognition of [0]'s \"mastery of historical and biographical description\" and oratorial output, [0] received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1953.He used either \"Winston S. Churchill\" or \"Winston Spencer Churchill\" as [0]'s pen name to avoid confusion with the American novelist of the same name, with whom [0] struck up a friendly correspondence. For many years, [0] relied heavily upon [0]'s press articles to assuage [0]'s financial worries: in 1937, for example, [0] wrote 64 published articles and some of [0]'s contracts were quite lucrative.As well as writing, [0] became an accomplished amateur artist after [0]'s resignation from the Admiralty in 1915. Using the pseudonym \"Charles Morin\", [0] continued an accomplished amateur artist throughout [0]'s life and completed hundreds of paintings, many of which are on show in the studio at Chartwell as well as in private collections.[0] was an amateur bricklayer, constructing buildings and garden walls at Chartwell. To further constructing, [0] joined the Amalgamated Union of Building Trade Workers but was expelled after [0] revived [0]'s membership of the Conservative Party. [0] also bred butterflies at Chartwell, keeping butterflies in a converted summerhouse each year until the weather was right for butterflies's release. [0] was well known for [0]'s love of animals and always had several pets, mainly cats but also dogs, pigs, lambs, bantams, goats and fox cubs among others. [0] has often been quoted as saying that \"cats look down on us and dogs look up to us, but pigs treat us as equals\", or words to that effect, but the International Churchill Society believe [0] has mostly been misquoted."}, "Legacy and assessments": {"\"A man of destiny\"": "Winston Churchill is our person to focus on. [0] concludes [0]'s biography of Winston Churchill by comparing Winston Churchill favourably with W. E. Gladstone and summarising:[0] now put Winston Churchill, with all Winston Churchill's idiosyncrasies, Winston Churchill's indulgences, Winston Churchill's occasional childishness, but also Winston Churchill's genius, Winston Churchill's tenacity and Winston Churchill's persistent ability, right or wrong, successful or unsuccessful, to be larger than life, as the greatest human being ever to occupy 10 Downing Street. Winston Churchill always self-confidently believed Winston Churchill to be \"a man of destiny\". Because of believed Winston Churchill lacked restraint and could be reckless. Winston Churchill's manifested believed in terms of Winston Churchill's \"affinity with war\" of which, according to Sebastian Haffner, Winston Churchill exhibited \"a profound and innate understanding\". Winston Churchill considered Winston Churchill a military genius but considered made Winston Churchill vulnerable to failure and Paul Addison says Gallipoli was \"the greatest blow Winston Churchill's self-image was ever to sustain\". [0] points out, however, that although Winston Churchill was excited and exhilarated by war, Winston Churchill was never indifferent to the suffering war causes.", "Political ideology": "[0] is our person to focus on. As a politician, [0] was perceived by some observers to have been largely motivated by personal ambition rather than political principle. During [0]'s early parliamentary career, [0] was often deliberately provocative and argumentative to an unusual degree; and [0]'s barbed rhetorical style earned [0] many enemies in parliament. On the other hand, [0] was deemed to be an honest politician who displayed particular loyalty to [0]'s family and close friends. [0] was, according to Jenkins, \"singularly lacking in inhibition or concealment\". Robert Rhodes James said [0] \"lacked any capacity for intrigue and was refreshingly innocent and straightforward\".Until the outbreak of the Second World War, [0]'s approach to politics generated widespread \"mistrust and dislike\", largely on account of [0]'s two party defections. [0]'s biographers have variously categorised [0], in terms of political ideology, as \"fundamentally conservative\", \"(always) liberal in outlook\", and \"never circumscribed by party affiliation\". Jenkins says that [0]'s self-belief was \"far stronger than any class or tribal loyalty\". Whether [0] was a conservative or a liberal, [0] was nearly always opposed to socialism because of socialism's propensity for state planning and [0]'s belief in free markets. The exception was during [0]'s wartime coalition when [0] was completely reliant upon the support of [0]'s Labour colleagues. Although the Labour leaders were willing to join [0]'s coalition, [0] had long been regarded as an enemy of the working class. [0]'s response to the Rhondda Valley unrest and [0]'s anti-socialist rhetoric brought condemnation from socialists. socialists saw [0] as a reactionary who represented imperialism, militarism, and the interests of the upper classes in the class war. [0]'s role in opposing the General Strike earned the enmity of many strikers and most members of the Labour movement. Paradoxically, [0] was supportive of trade unionism, which [0] saw as the \"antithesis of socialism\".On the other hand, [0]'s detractors did not take [0]'s domestic reforms into account, for [0] was in many respects a radical and a reformer, but always with the intention of preserving the existing social structure, never of challenging the existing social structure. [0] could not empathise with the poor, so [0] sympathised with the poor instead, displaying what Addison calls the attitude of a \"benevolent paternalist\". Jenkins remarked that [0] had \"a substantial record as a social reformer\" for [0]'s work in the early years of [0]'s ministerial career. Similarly, Robert Rhodes James thought that, as a social reformer, [0]'s achievements were \"considerable\". This, said Robert Rhodes James, had been achieved because [0] had \"three outstanding qualities. [0] worked hard; [0] put [0]'s proposals efficiently through the Cabinet and Parliament; [0] carried [0]'s Department with [0]. These ministerial merits are not as common as might be thought\".", "Imperialism and racial views": "[0] is our person to focus on. Assessments of [0]'s legacy are largely based on [0]'s leadership of the British people in the Second World War. Even so, [0]'s personal views on empire and race continue to stir debate. [0] was a staunch imperialist and monarchist, and [0] consistently exhibited a \"romanticised view\" of both the British Empire and the reigning monarch, especially of Elizabeth\u00a0II during [0]'s last term as premier.[0] has been described as a \"liberal imperialist\" who saw British imperialism as a form of altruism that benefited British imperialism's subject peoples because \"by conquering and dominating other peoples, the British were also elevating and protecting other peoples\". Martin Gilbert asserted that [0] held a hierarchical perspective of race, seeing racial characteristics as signs of the maturity of a society. [0]'s views on race were driven by [0]'s imperialist mindset and outlook. [0] advocated against black or indigenous self-rule in Africa, Australia, the Caribbean, the Americas and India, believing that the British Empire promoted and maintained the welfare of those who lived in the colonies; [0] insisted that \"the British's responsibility to the native races remains a real one\". In 1906, [0] stated that \"the British will endeavour\u00a0... to advance the principle of equal rights of civilised men irrespective of colour\".According to Addison, [0] was opposed to immigration from the Commonwealth. Addison makes the point that [0] opposed anti-Semitism (as in 1904, when [0] was fiercely critical of the proposed Aliens Bill) and argues that [0] would never have tried \"to stoke up racial animosity against immigrants, or to persecute minorities\".  In the 1920s, [0] supported Zionism but believed that communism was the product of an international Jewish conspiracy; in an article in the Illustrated Sunday Herald, [0] wrote that a group of \"international\" Jews supported a Bolshevist \"world-wide conspiracy for the overthrow of civilisation and for the reconstitution of society on the basis of arrested development, of envious malevolence, and impossible equality\". Although this belief was not unique among British politicians of the time, few had the stature of [0], and an article in the Illustrated Sunday Herald was criticised by the Jewish Chronicle at the time.[0] made a number of disparaging remarks about non-white ethnicities throughout [0]'s life, including a series of racist comments and jokes about Indian nationalists made to colleagues during the inter-war period and his wartime premiership. Historian Philip Murphy partly attributes the strength of a series of racist comments and jokes about Indian nationalists made to colleagues during the inter-war period and his wartime premiership to an \"almost childish desire to shock\" [0]'s inner circle. [0]'s response to the Bengal famine was criticised by some contemporaries as slow (see \u00a7\u00a0Bengal famine), a controversy later increased by the publication of private remarks made to Secretary for India Leo Amery, in which [0] allegedly said that aid would be inadequate because \"Indians [were] breeding like rabbits\". Historian Philip Murphy says that, following the independence of India in 1947, [0] adopted a more pragmatic stance towards empire, although [0] continued to use imperial rhetoric. During [0]'s second term as prime minister, [0] was seen as a moderating influence on Britain's suppression of armed insurgencies against colonial rule in Malaya and Kenya; [0] argued that ruthless policies contradicted British values and international opinion.", "": ""}, "Cultural depictions": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. While the biographies by Addison, Gilbert, Jenkins and Rhodes James are among the most acclaimed works about [0], [0] has been the subject of numerous others.
