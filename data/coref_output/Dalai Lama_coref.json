While the 5th Dalai Lama had no formal or institutional role in any of the religious traditions, which were headed by their own high lamasthe religious traditions, which were headed by their own high lamas's , the 5th Dalai Lama was a unifying symbol of the state of Tibet, where he has represented Buddhist values and traditions, representing Buddhist values and traditions above any specific school.

Samding Dorje PhagmoIn Central Asian Buddhist countries, it has been widely believed for the last millennium that Avalokite\u015bvara, the bodhisattva of compassion, has a special relationship with [0] and intervenes in [0]'s fate by incarnating as benevolent rulers and teachers such as the Dalai Lamas. believed is according to The Book of Kadam, the main text of the Kadampa school, to which the 1st Dalai Lama, Gendun Drup, first belonged.The Book of Kadam, the main text of the Kadampa school, to which the 1st Dalai Lama, Gendun Drup, first belonged is said to have laid the foundation for the Tibetans' later identification of the Dalai Lamas as incarnations of Avalokite\u015bvara, the bodhisattva of compassion\u00a0source\u00a0needed]It traces the legend of Avalokite\u015bvara, the bodhisattva of compassion's incarnations as early Tibetan kings and emperors such as Songtsen Gampo and later as Dromt\u00f6npa (1004\u20131064).This lineage has been extrapolated by Tibetans up to and including the Dalai Lamas.", "Origins in myth and legend": "Dalai Lama is our person to focus on. Thus, according to such sources, an informal line of succession of the present Dalai Lamas as incarnations of Avalokite\u015bvara stretches back much further than Gendun Drub. The Book of Kadam, the compilation of Kadampa teachings largely composed around discussions between [0] and his Tibetan host and chief disciple Dromt\u00f6npa and Tales of the Previous Incarnations of Avalokite\u015bvara, nominate as many as sixty persons prior to Gendun Drub who are enumerated as earlier incarnations of Avalokite\u015bvara and predecessors in the same lineage leading up to Avalokite\u015bvara. In brief, these include a mythology of 36 Indian personalities plus 10 early Tibetan kings and emperors, all said to be previous incarnations of his Tibetan host and chief disciple Dromt\u00f6npa, and fourteen further Nepalese and Tibetan yogis and sages in between his Tibetan host and chief disciple Dromt\u00f6npa and the 1st Dalai Lama. In fact, according to the \"Birth to Exile\" article on the 14th Dalai Lama's's website, the 14th Dalai Lama's is \"the seventy-fourth in a lineage that can be traced back to a Brahmin boy who lived in the time of Buddha Shakyamuni.\"", "Avalokite\u015bvara's \"Dalai Lama master plan\"": "Dalai Lama is our person to focus on. According to the 14th Dalai Lama, long ago [0] had promised the Buddha to guide and defend the Tibetan people. In the late Middle Ages, his master plan to fulfill this promise was the stage-by-stage establishment of the Dalai Lama theocracy in Tibet.First, Tsongkhapa established three great monasteries around Lhasa in the province of \u00dc before Tsongkhapa died in 1419. The 1st Dalai Lama soon became Abbot of the greatest one, Drepung, and developed a large popular power base in \u00dc. He later extended this to cover Tsang, where he constructed a fourth great monastery, Tashi Lhunpo, at Shigatsea large popular power base in \u00dc. He later extended this to cover Tsang, where he constructed a fourth great monastery, Tashi Lhunpo, at Shigatse . The 2nd studied there before returning to LhasaThe 2nd the greatest one, Drepung. Having reactivated The 1st Dalai Lama's large popular followings in Tsang, where he constructed a fourth great monastery, Tashi Lhunpo, at Shigatse and the province of \u00dc, The 2nd then moved on to southern Tibet and gathered more followers there who helped The 2nd construct a new monastery, Chokorgyel. The 2nd established the method by which later Dalai Lama incarnations would be discovered through visions at the \"oracle lake\", Lhamo Lhatso.The 3rd built on The 3rd's predecessors' fame by becoming Abbot of the two great monasteries of the greatest one, Drepung and Sera. The stage was set for the great Mongol King Altan Khan, hearing of The 3rd's reputation, to invite The 3rd to Mongolia where The 3rd converted the great Mongol King Altan Khan and the great Mongol King Altan Khan's followers to Buddhism, as well as other Mongol princes and other Mongol princes's followers covering a vast tract of central Asia. Thus, most of Mongolia was added to Dalai Lama's sphere of influence, founding a spiritual empire which largely survives to the modern age. After being given the Mongolian name 'Dalai', The 3rd returned to Tibet to found the great monasteries of Lithang in Kham, eastern Tibet and Kumbum in Amdo, north-eastern Tibet.The 4th was then born in Mongolia as the great-grandson of the great Mongol King Altan Khan, thus cementing strong ties between central Asia, Dalai Lama, the Gelugpa and Tibet. In fulfilment of his master plan to fulfill this promise, the 5th in the succession used the vast popular power base of devoted followers built up by the 5th in the succession's four predecessors. By 1642, a strategy that was planned and carried out by his resourceful chagdzo or manager Sonam Rapten with the military assistance of his resourceful chagdzo or manager Sonam Rapten's devoted disciple Gushri Khan, Chieftain of the Khoshut Mongols, enabled the 5th in the succession to found Dalai Lama's religious and political reign over more or less the whole of Tibet that survived for over 300 years.Thus Dalai Lama became pre-eminent spiritual leaders in Tibet and 25 Himalayan and Central Asian kingdoms and countries bordering Tibet and Dalai Lama's prolific literary works have \"for centuries acted as major sources of spiritual and philosophical inspiration to more than fifty million people of 25 Himalayan and Central Asian kingdoms and countries bordering Tibet\". Overall, Dalai Lama have played \"a monumental role in Asian literary, philosophical and religious history\".", "Establishment of the Dalai Lama lineage": "[0] is our person to focus on. Gendun Drup (1391\u20131474), a disciple of the founder Je Tsongkapa, was the ordination name of [0], but only from 104 years after [0] died.There had been resistance, since first [0] was ordained a monk in the Kadampa tradition and for various reasons, for hundreds of years the Kadampa tradition had eschewed the adoption of the tulku system to which the older schools adhered. the founder Je Tsongkapa largely modelled the founder Je Tsongkapa's new, reformed Gelugpa school on the Kadampa tradition and refrained from starting a tulku system. Therefore, although [0] grew to be a very important Gelugpa lama, after [0] died in 1474 there was no question of any search being made to identify [0]'s incarnation.Despite this, when the Tashilhunpo monks started hearing what seemed credible accounts that an incarnation of Gendun Drup had appeared nearby and repeatedly announced an incarnation of Gendun Drup from the age of two, the Tashilhunpo monks's curiosity was aroused. It was some 55 years after the founder Je Tsongkapa's when eventually, the monastic authorities saw compelling evidence that convinced the Tashilhunpo monks an incarnation of Gendun Drup was indeed the incarnation of the founder Je Tsongkapa. the Tashilhunpo monks felt obliged to break with the Tashilhunpo monks's own tradition and in 1487, an incarnation of Gendun Drup was renamed Gendun Gyatso and installed at Tashilhunpo as [0]'s tulku, albeit informally.Gendun Gyatso died in 1542 and the lineage of Dalai Lama tulkus finally became firmly established when the third incarnation, Sonam Gyatso (1543\u20131588), came forth. the third incarnation, Sonam Gyatso (1543\u20131588) made the third incarnation, Sonam Gyatso (1543\u20131588) known as the tulku of Gendun Gyatso and was formally recognised and enthroned at Drepung in 1546. When Gendun Gyatso was given the titular name \"Dalai Lama\" by the T\u00fcmed Altan Khan in 1578,:\u200a153\u200a Gendun Gyatso's two predecessors were accorded the titular name \"Dalai Lama\" posthumously and Gendun Gyatso became known as the third in the lineage of Dalai Lama tulkus.", "1st Dalai Lama": "Dalai Lama is our person to focus on. The Dalai Lama title was posthumously given to Gedun Drupa after 1578. The Dalai Lama lineage started from humble beginnings. 'Pema Dorje' (1391\u20131474), the boy who was to become the first in the line, was born in a cattle pen in Shabtod, Tsang in 1391. [0]'s nomad parents kept sheep and goats and lived in tents. When [0]'s father died in 1398 his mother was unable to support [0] so his mother entrusted [0] to [0]'s uncle, a monk at Narthang, a major Kadampa monastery near Shigatse, for education as a Buddhist monk. Narthang, a major Kadampa monastery near Shigatse, ran the largest printing press in Tibet and Narthang, a major Kadampa monastery near Shigatse,'s celebrated library attracted scholars and adepts from far and wide, so [0] received an education beyond the norm at the time as well as exposure to diverse spiritual schools and ideas.[0] studied Buddhist philosophy extensively. In 1405, ordained by Narthang, a major Kadampa monastery near Shigatse,'s , [0] took the name of Gendun Drup. Soon recognised as an exceptionally gifted pupil, Narthang's abbot tutored [0] personally and took special interest in [0]'s progress. In 12 years [0] passed the 12 grades of monkhood and took the highest vows. After completing [0]'s intensive studies at Narthang, a major Kadampa monastery near Shigatse, [0] left to continue at specialist monasteries in Central Tibet, [0]'s grounding at Narthang, a major Kadampa monastery near Shigatse, was revered among many [0] encountered.In 1415 [0] met Tsongkhapa, founder of the Gelugpa school, and became Tsongkhapa, founder of the Gelugpa school's student; met was of decisive historical and political significance as [0] was later to be known as the 1st Dalai Lama. When eventually Tsongkhapa, founder of the Gelugpa school's successor the Panchen Lama Khedrup Je died, [0] became the leader of the Gelugpa school. [0] rose to become Abbot of Drepung, the greatest Gelugpa monastery, outside Lhasa.It was mainly due to [0]'s energy and ability that Tsongkhapa, founder of the Gelugpa school's grew into an expanding order capable of competing with others on an equal footing. Taking advantage of good relations with the nobility and a lack of determined opposition from rival orders, on the very edge of Karma Kagyu-dominated territory [0] founded Tashilhunpo Monastery at Shigatse. [0] was based there, as Tashilhunpo Monastery at Shigatse's Abbot, from Tashilhunpo Monastery at Shigatse's founding in 1447 until [0]'s death. Tashilhunpo Monastery at Shigatse's, became the fourth great Gelugpa monastery in Tibet, after Ganden, Drepung and Sera had all been founded in Tsongkhapa, founder of the Gelugpa school's time. Tashilhunpo Monastery at Shigatse later became the seat of the Panchen Lamas.By establishing Tashilhunpo Monastery at Shigatse at Shigatse in the middle of Tsang, [0] expanded the Gelugpa sphere of influence, and [0]'s own, from the Lhasa region of \u00dc to Tsangthe Karma Kagyu school their patrons, the rising Tsangpa dynasty. Tashilhunpo Monastery at Shigatse was destined to become 'Southern Tibet's greatest monastic university' with a complement of 3,000 monks.[0] was said to be the greatest scholar-saint ever produced by Narthang, a major Kadampa monastery near Shigatse, and became 'the single most important lama in Tibet'. Through hard work [0] became a leading lama, known as 'Perfecter of the Monkhood', 'with a host of disciples'. Famed for [0]'s Buddhist scholarship [0] was also referred to as Panchen Gendun Drup, 'Panchen' being an honorary title designating 'great scholar'. By the great Jonangpa master Bodong Chokley Namgyal [0] was accorded the honorary title Tamchey Khyenpa meaning \"The Omniscient One\", an appellation that was later assigned to all Dalai Lama incarnations.At the age of 50, [0] entered meditation retreat at NarthangNarthang, a major Kadampa monastery near Shigatse,. As [0] grew older, Karma Kagyu adherents, finding the Karma Kagyu school was losing too many recruits to the monkhood to burgeoning Gelugpa monasteries, tried to contain Gelug expansion by launching military expeditions against Gelug expansion in the region. This led to decades of military and political power struggles between Tsangpa dynasty forces and others across central Tibet. In an attempt to ameliorate decades of military and political power struggles between Tsangpa dynasty forces and others across central Tibet, from meditation retreat at Narthang [0] issued a poem of advice to [0]'s followers advising restraint from responding to violence with more violence and to practice compassion and patience instead. The poem, entitled Shar Gang Rima, \"The Song of the Eastern Snow Mountains\", became one of [0]'s most enduring popular literary works.Although [0] was born in a cattle pen to be a simple goatherd, [0] rose to become one of the most celebrated and respected teachers in Tibet and Central Asia. [0]'s spiritual accomplishments brought [0] substantial donations from devotees which [0] used to build and furnish new monasteries, to print and distribute Buddhist texts and to maintain monks and meditators. At last, at the age of 84, older than any of [0]'s 13 successors, in 1474 [0] went on foot to visit Narthang, a major Kadampa monastery near Shigatse, on a final teaching tour. Returning to Tashilhunpo Monastery at Shigatse [0] died 'in a blaze of glory, recognised as having attained Buddhahood'.[0]'s mortal remains were interred in a bejewelled silver stupa at Tashilhunpo Monastery at Shigatse, which survived the Cultural Revolution and can still be seen.", "2nd Dalai Lama": "Dalai Lama is our person to focus on. Like the Kadampa, the Gelugpa eschewed the tulku system. After Gendun Drup died, however, [0], declared [0] at 3 to be \"Gendun Drup\" and asked to be 'taken home' to Tashilhunpo. [0] spoke in mystical verses, quoted classical texts out of the blue and said [0] was Dromt\u00f6npa, an earlier incarnation of the Dalai Lamas. When [0] saw monks from Tashilhunpo [0] greeted the disciples of Gendun Drup by name. The Gelugpa elders had to break with tradition and recognised [0] as Gendun Drup's tulku.[0] was then 8, but until [0]'s 12th year [0]'s took [0] on his father's teachings and retreats, training [0] in all the family Nyingma lineages. At 12 [0] was installed at Tashilhunpo as Gendun Drup's incarnation, ordained, enthroned and renamed Gendun Gyatso Palzangpo (1475\u20131542).Tutored personally by the abbot [0] made rapid progress and from 1492 at 17 [0] was requested to teach all over Tsang, where thousands gathered to listen and give obeisance, including senior scholars and abbots. In 1494, at 19, [0] met some opposition from the Tashilhunpo establishment when tensions arose over conflicts between advocates of the two types of succession, the traditional abbatial election through merit, and incarnation. Although [0] had served for some years as Tashilhunpo's abbot, [0] therefore moved to central Tibet, where [0] was invited to Drepung and where [0]'s reputation as a brilliant young teacher quickly grew.[0] was accorded all the loyalty and devotion that Gendun Drup had earned and the Gelugpa remained as united as ever. moved had the effect of shifting central Gelug authority back to Lhasa. Under [0]'s leadership, the Gelugpa went on growing in size and influence and with the Gelugpa's appeal of simplicity, devotion and austerity the Gelugpa's lamas were asked to mediate in disputes between other rivals. [0]'s popularity in \u00dc-Tsang grew as [0] went on pilgrimage, travelling, teaching and studying from masters such as the adept Khedrup Norzang Gyatso in the Olklha mountains. [0] also stayed in Kongpo and Dagpo and became known all over Tibet. [0] spent [0]'s winters in Lhasa, writing commentaries and the rest of the year travelling and teaching many thousands of monks and lay people.In 1509 [0] moved to southern Tibet to build Chokorgyel Monastery near the 'Oracle Lake', Lhamo Latso, completing Chokorgyel Monastery near the 'Oracle Lake', Lhamo Latso by 1511. 1511 [0] saw visions in the 'Oracle Lake', Lhamo Latso and 'empowered' the 'Oracle Lake', Lhamo Latso to impart clues to help identify incarnate lamas. All Dalai Lamas from the 3rd on were found with the help of such visions granted to regents. By now widely regarded as one of Tibet's greatest saints and scholars [0] was invited back to Tashilhunpo. On [0]'s return in 1512, [0] was given the residence built for Gendun Drup, to be occupied later by the Panchen Lamas. [0] was made abbot of Tashilhunpo and stayed there teaching in Tsang for 9 months.[0] continued to travel widely and teach while based at Tibet's largest monastery, Drepung and became known as 'Drepung Lama', [0]'s fame and influence spreading all over Central Asia as the best students from hundreds of lesser monasteries in Asia were sent to Tibet's largest monastery, Drepung for education.Throughout [0]'s life, the Gelugpa were opposed and suppressed by older rivals, particularly the Karma Kagyu and their Ringpung clan patrons from Tsang, who felt threatened by their loss of influenceolder rivals, particularly the Karma Kagyu and their Ringpung clan patrons from Tsang, who felt threatened by their loss of influence's . In 1498 the Ringpung army captured Lhasa and banned the Gelugpa annual New Year Monlam Prayer Festival started by Tsongkhapa for world peace and prosperity. [0] was promoted to abbot of Tibet's largest monastery, Drepung in 1517 and that year Ringpung forces were forced to withdraw from Lhasa.[0] then went to the Gongma (King) Drakpa Jungne to obtain permission for the Gelugpa annual New Year Monlam Prayer Festival started by Tsongkhapa for world peace and prosperity to be held again. The next New Year, the Gongma was so impressed by [0]'s performance leading the Gelugpa annual New Year Monlam Prayer Festival started by Tsongkhapa for world peace and prosperity that the Gongma sponsored construction of a large new residence for him at Drepung, 'a monastery within a monastery'. a large new residence for him at Drepung, 'a monastery within a monastery' was called the Ganden Phodrang, a name later adopted by the Tibetan Government, and a large new residence for him at Drepung, 'a monastery within a monastery' served as home for Dalai Lamas until the Fifth moved to the Potala Palace in 1645.In 1525, already abbot of Chokhorgyel, Tibet's largest monastery, Drepung and Tashilhunpo, [0] was made abbot of Sera monastery as well, and seeing the number of monks was low [0] worked to increase the number of monks.Based at Tibet's largest monastery, Drepung in winter and Chokorgyel in summer, [0] spent [0]'s remaining years in composing commentaries, regional teaching tours, visiting Tashilhunpo from time to time and acting as abbot of these four great monasteries. As abbot, [0] made Tibet's largest monastery, Drepung the largest monastery in TibetTibet. [0] attracted many students and disciples 'from Kashmir to China' as well as major patrons and disciples such as Gongma Nangso Donyopa of Droda who built a monastery at Zhekar Dzong in [0]'s honour and invited [0] to name a monastery at Zhekar Dzong and be a monastery at Zhekar Dzong's spiritual guide.Gongma Gyaltsen Palzangpo of Khyomorlung at Tolung and his Queen Sangyey Paldzomma also became [0]'s favorite devoted lay patrons and disciples in the 1530s and [0] visited Gongma Gyaltsen Palzangpo of Khyomorlung at Tolung and his Queen Sangyey Paldzomma's to carry out rituals as '[0] chose their area for [0]'s next place of rebirth'. [0] died in meditation at Tibet's largest monastery, Drepung in 1542 at 67 and [0]'s reliquary stupa was constructed at Khyomorlung at Tolung. It was said that, by the time [0] died, through [0]'s and his disciples's students, [0]'s personal influence covered the whole of Buddhist Central Asia where 'there was nobody of any consequence who did not know of [0]'. The Dalai Lama title was posthumously granted to [0] after 1578.", "3rd Dalai Lama": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was born in Tolung, near Lhasa,as predicted by [0]'s predecessor. Claiming [0] was Gendun Gyatso and readily recalling events from [0]'s previous life, [0] was recognised as the incarnation, named 'Sonam Gyatso' and installed at Drepung, where 'he quickly excelled his teachers in knowledge and wisdom and developed extraordinary powers'. Unlike his predecessors, [0] came from a noble family, connected with the Sakya and the Phagmo Drupa (Karma Kagyu affiliated) dynasties, and it is to [0] that the effective conversion of Mongolia to Buddhism is due.A brilliant scholar and teacher, [0] had the spiritual maturity to be made Abbot of Drepung, where 'he quickly excelled his teachers in knowledge and wisdom and developed extraordinary powers', taking responsibility for the material and spiritual well-being of Drepung, where 'he quickly excelled his teachers in knowledge and wisdom and developed extraordinary powers' at the age of nine. At 10 [0] led the Monlam Prayer Festival, giving daily discourses to the assembly of all Gelugpa monks. [0]'s influence grew so quickly that soon the monks at Sera Monastery also made [0] the monks at Sera Monastery's Abbot and [0]'s mediation was being sought to prevent fighting between political power factions. At 16, in 1559, [0] was invited to Nedong by King Ngawang Tashi Drakpa, a Karma Kagyu supporter, and became King Ngawang Tashi Drakpa, a Karma Kagyu supporter's personal teacher.At 17, when fighting broke out in Lhasa between Gelug and Kagyu parties and efforts by local lamas to mediate failed, [0] negotiated a peaceful settlement. At 19, when the Kyichu River burst the Kyichu River's banks and flooded Lhasa, [0] led [0]'s followers to rescue victims and repair the dykes. [0] then instituted a custom whereby on the last day of the Monlam Prayer Festival, all the monks would work on strengthening the flood defences. Gradually, [0] was shaping [0] into a national leader. [0]'s popularity and renown became such that in 1564 when King Ngawang Tashi Drakpa, a Karma Kagyu supporter died, it was Sonam Gyatso at the age of 21 who was requested to lead King Ngawang Tashi Drakpa, a Karma Kagyu supporter's funeral rites, rather than [0]'s own Kagyu lamas.Required to travel and teach without respite after taking full ordination in 1565, [0] still maintained extensive meditation practices in the hours before dawn and again at the end of the day. In 1569, at age 26, [0] went to Tashilhunpo to study the layout and administration of the monastery built by his predecessor Gendun Drup. Invited to become the Abbot [0] declined, already being Abbot of Drepung, where 'he quickly excelled his teachers in knowledge and wisdom and developed extraordinary powers' and Sera Monastery, but left [0]'s deputy there in [0]'s stead. From there [0] visited Narthang, the first monastery of his predecessor Gendun Drup and gave numerous discourses and offerings to the monks in gratitude.Meanwhile, Altan Khan, chief of all the Mongol tribes near China's borders, had heard of [0]'s spiritual prowess and repeatedly invited [0] to Mongolia. By 1571, when Altan Khan, chief of all the Mongol tribes near China's borders, received a title of Shunyi Wang (King) from the Ming dynasty of China and swore allegiance to the Ming dynasty of China, Although Altan Khan, chief of all the Mongol tribes near China's borders, remained de facto quite independent,:\u200a106\u200a Altan Khan, chief of all the Mongol tribes near China's borders, had fulfilled Altan Khan, chief of all the Mongol tribes near China's borders,'s political destiny and a nephew advised Altan Khan, chief of all the Mongol tribes near China's borders, to seek spiritual salvation, saying that \"in Tibet's dwells Avalokiteshvara\", referring to [0]. China's was also happy to help Altan Khan, chief of all the Mongol tribes near China's borders, by providing necessary translations of holy scripture, and also lamas.At the second invitation, in 1577\u201378 [0] travelled 1,500 miles to Mongolia to see Altan Khan, chief of all the Mongol tribes near China's borders,. They met in an atmosphere of intense reverence and devotion and met resulted in the re-establishment of strong Tibet's-Mongolia relations after a gap of 200 years.To Altan Khan, chief of all the Mongol tribes near China's borders,, [0] identified [0] as the incarnation of Drog\u00f6n Ch\u00f6gyal Phagpa, and Altan Khan, chief of all the Mongol tribes near China's borders, as that of Kubilai Khan, thus placing Altan Khan, chief of all the Mongol tribes near China's borders, as heir to the Chingizid lineage whilst securing Altan Khan, chief of all the Mongol tribes near China's borders,'s patronage.Altan Khan, chief of all the Mongol tribes near China's borders, Altan Khan, chief of all the Mongol tribes near China's borders,'s quickly adopted Buddhism as Altan Khan and his followers's state religion, replacing the prohibited traditional Shamanism.Mongol law was reformed to accord with Tibetan Buddhist law. From this time Buddhism spread rapidly across Mongolia and soon the Gelugpa had won the spiritual allegiance of most of the Mongolian tribes.As proposed by [0], Altan Khan, chief of all the Mongol tribes near China's borders, sponsored the building of Thegchen Chonkhor Monastery at the site of [0]'s open-air teachings given to the whole Mongol population. Altan Khan, chief of all the Mongol tribes near China's borders, also called [0] \"Dalai\", Mongolian for 'Gyatso' (Ocean).In October 1587, as requested by the family of Altan Khan, chief of all the Mongol tribes near China's borders,, [0] was promoted to Du\u01d2 Er Zh\u01d0 Ch\u00e0ng (Chinese:\u6735\u513f\u53ea\u5531) by the emperor of China, seal of authority and golden sheets were granted.The name \"Dalai Lama\", by which the lineage later became known throughout the non-Tibetan world, was thus established and The name \"Dalai Lama\", by which the lineage later became known throughout the non-Tibetan world was applied to his predecessors retrospectively.In 1579, the Ming dynasty of China allowed [0] to pay regular tribute. Returning eventually to Tibet's by a roundabout route and invited to stay and teach all along the way, in 1580 [0] was in Hohhot [or Ningxia], not far from Beijing, when the emperor of China summoned [0] to the emperor of China's court.By then [0] had established a religious empire of such proportions that it was unsurprising the emperor of China wanted to summon [0] and grant [0] a diploma.Through Altan Khan, chief of all the Mongol tribes near China's borders,, [0] requested to pay tribute to the emperor of China in order to raise [0]'s State Tutor ranking, and the Ming dynasty of China agreed with requested. In 1582, [0] heard Altan Khan, chief of all the Mongol tribes near China's borders, had died and invited by Altan Khan, chief of all the Mongol tribes near China's borders,'s [0] decided to return to Mongolia. Passing through Amdo, [0] founded a second great monastery, Kumbum, at the birthplace of Tsongkhapa near Kokonor. Further on, [0] was asked to adjudicate on border disputes between Mongolia and China's. It was the first time a Dalai Lama had exercised such political authority.Arriving in Mongolia in 1585, [0] stayed 2 years with his son Dh\u00fcring Khan, teaching Buddhism to his son Dh\u00fcring Khan's people and converting more Mongol princes and more Mongol princes's tribes. Receiving a second invitation from the emperor of China in Beijing [0] accepted, but died en route in 1588. As [0] was dying, his Mongolian converts urged [0] not to leave his Mongolian converts, as his Mongolian converts needed [0]'s continuing religious leadership. [0] promised his Mongolian converts [0] would be incarnated next in Mongolia, as a Mongolian.", "4th Dalai Lama": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was a Mongol, the great-grandson of Altan Khan who was a descendant of Kublai Khan and leader of the T\u00fcmed Mongols who had already been converted to Buddhism by the Third Dalai Lama, Sonam Gyatso (1543\u20131588). This strong connection caused the Mongols to zealously support the Gelugpa sect in Tibet, strengthening the Mongols's status and position but also arousing intensified opposition from the Gelugpa sect's rivals, particularly the Tsang Karma Kagyu in Shigatse and their Mongol patrons and the B\u00f6npo in Kham and the B\u00f6npo in Kham's allies. Being the newest school, unlike the older schools the Gelugpa sect lacked an established network of Tibetan clan patronage and were thus more reliant on foreign patrons.At the age of 10 with a large Mongol escort [0] travelled to Lhasa where [0] was enthroned. [0] studied at Drepung and became Drepung's abbot but being a non-Tibetan [0] met with opposition from some Tibetans, especially the Karma Kagyu who felt the Karma Kagyu's position was threatened by these emerging events; there were several attempts to remove [0] from power. Seal of authority was granted in 1616 by Wanli Emperor of Ming. [0] died at the age of 27 under suspicious circumstances and his chief attendant Sonam Rapten went on to discover the 5th Dalai Lama, became the 5th Dalai Lama's chagdzo or manager and after 1642 his chief attendant Sonam Rapten went on to be the 5th Dalai Lama's regent, the Desi.", "5th Dalai Lama": "Dalai Lama is our person to focus on. The death of [0] in 1617 led to open conflict breaking out between various parties. Firstly, the Tsangpa dynasty, rulers of Central Tibet from Shigatse, supporters of the Karmapa school and rivals to the Gelugpa, forbade the search for [0]'s . However, in 1618 Sonam Rabten, the former attendant of the 4th Dalai Lama who had become the Ganden Phodrang treasurer, secretly identified his incarnation. Then, the Panchen Lama, in Shigatse, negotiated the lifting of forbade, enabling his incarnation to be recognised as Lobsang Gyatso, the 5th Dalai Lama.Also in 1618, the Tsangpa King, Karma Puntsok Namgyal, whose Mongol patron was Choghtu Khong Tayiji of the Khalkha Mongols, attacked the Gelugpa in Lhasa to avenge an earlier snub and established two military bases there to control the monasteries and Lhasa. attacked caused Sonam Rabten, the former attendant of the 4th Dalai Lama who had become the Ganden Phodrang treasurer, to seek more active Mongol patronage and military assistance for the Gelugpa while the 5th Dalai Lama's was still a boy. So, in 1620, Mongol troops allied to the Gelugpa who had camped outside Lhasa suddenly attacked and destroyed the two Tsangpa camps and drove the two Tsangpa camps out of Lhasa, enabling the 5th Dalai Lama's to be brought out of hiding and publicly enthroned there in 1622.In fact, throughout the 5th Dalai Lama's's minority, it was Sonam Rabten, the former attendant of the 4th Dalai Lama who had become the Ganden Phodrang treasurer who inspired the Dzungar Mongols to defend the Gelugpa by attacking their enemies. their enemies included other Mongol tribes who supported the Tsangpa dynasty, rulers of Central Tibet from Shigatse, supporters of the Karmapa school and rivals to the Gelugpa, the Tsangpa dynasty, rulers of Central Tibet from Shigatse, supporters of the Karmapa school and rivals to the Gelugpa and the Tsangpa dynasty, rulers of Central Tibet from Shigatse, supporters of the Karmapa school and rivals to the Gelugpa's B\u00f6npo allies in Kham who had also opposed and persecuted Gelugpas. Ultimately, this strategy led to the destruction of the Tsangpa dynasty, rulers of Central Tibet from Shigatse, supporters of the Karmapa school and rivals to the Gelugpa, the defeat of the Tsangpa dynasty, rulers of Central Tibet from Shigatse, supporters of the Karmapa school and rivals to the Gelugpa and the Tsangpa dynasty, rulers of Central Tibet from Shigatse, supporters of the Karmapa school and rivals to the Gelugpa's other allies and the B\u00f6npos, by armed forces from the Lhasa valley aided by their Mongol alliesarmed forces from the Lhasa valley aided by their Mongol allies's , paving the way for Gelugpa political and religious hegemony in Central Tibet.Apparently by general consensus, by virtue of Sonam Rabten, the former attendant of the 4th Dalai Lama who had become the Ganden Phodrang treasurer's position as the 5th Dalai Lama's's changdzo (chief attendant, minister), after the 5th Dalai Lama's became absolute ruler of Tibet in 1642 Sonam Rabten, the former attendant of the 4th Dalai Lama who had become the Ganden Phodrang treasurer became the \"Desi\" or \"Viceroy\", in fact, the de facto regent or day-to-day ruler of Tibet's governmental affairs. During these years and for the rest of Sonam Rabten, the former attendant of the 4th Dalai Lama who had become the Ganden Phodrang treasurer's life (Sonam Rabten, the former attendant of the 4th Dalai Lama who had become the Ganden Phodrang treasurer died in 1658), \"there was little doubt that politically Sonam Chophel [Rabten] was more powerful than the 5th Dalai Lama's\". As a young man, being 22 years Sonam Rabten, the former attendant of the 4th Dalai Lama who had become the Ganden Phodrang treasurer's junior, the 5th Dalai Lama's addressed Sonam Rabten, the former attendant of the 4th Dalai Lama who had become the Ganden Phodrang treasurer reverentially as \"Zhalngo\", meaning \"the Presence\".During the 1630s Tibet was deeply entangled in rivalry, evolving power struggles and conflicts, not only between the Tibetan religious sects but also between the rising Manchus and the various rival Mongol and Oirat factions, who were also vying for supremacy amongst themselves and on behalf of the religious sects they patronisedthe various rival Mongol and Oirat factions, who were also vying for supremacy amongst themselves and on behalf of the religious sects they patronised the various rival Mongol and Oirat factions, who were also vying for supremacy amongst themselves and on behalf of the religious sects they patronised . For example, Ligdan Khan of the Chahars, a Mongol subgroup who supported the Tsang Karmapasthe Tsangpa dynasty, rulers of Central Tibet from Shigatse, supporters of the Karmapa school and rivals to the Gelugpa, after retreating from advancing Manchu armies headed for Kokonor intending destroy the Gelugpa. Ligdan Khan of the Chahars, a Mongol subgroup who supported the Tsang Karmapas died on the way, in 1634.His vassal Choghtu Khong Tayiji, continued to advance against the Gelugpa, even having 1634.His vassal Choghtu Khong Tayiji's killed after his own son Arslan changed sides, submitted to the 5th Dalai Lama's and become a the Gelugpa monk. By the mid-1630s, thanks again to the efforts of Sonam Rabten, the former attendant of the 4th Dalai Lama who had become the Ganden Phodrang treasurer, the 5th Dalai Lama's had found a powerful new patron in G\u00fcshi Khan of the Khoshut Mongols, a subgroup of the Dzungars, who had recently migrated to the Kokonor area from Dzungaria. G\u00fcshi Khan of the Khoshut Mongols, a subgroup of the Dzungars, who had recently migrated to the Kokonor area from Dzungaria attacked 1634.His vassal Choghtu Khong Tayiji at Kokonor in 1637 and defeated and killed 1634.His vassal Choghtu Khong Tayiji, thus eliminating the Tsangpa dynasty, rulers of Central Tibet from Shigatse, supporters of the Karmapa school and rivals to the Gelugpa and the Tsangpa dynasty, rulers of Central Tibet from Shigatse, supporters of the Karmapa school and rivals to the Gelugpa's main Mongol patron and protector.Next, Donyo Dorje, the B\u00f6npo king of Beri in Kham was found writing to the Tsangpa king in Shigatse to propose a co-ordinated 'pincer attack' on the Lhasa Gelugpa monasteries from east and west, seeking to utterly destroy the Lhasa Gelugpa monasteries once and for all. The intercepted letter was sent to G\u00fcshi Khan who used it as a pretext to invade central Tibet in 1639 to attack them both, the B\u00f6npo and the Tsangpa. By 1641 G\u00fcshi Khan who used it as a pretext to invade central Tibet in 1639 to attack them both, the B\u00f6npo and the Tsangpa had defeated Donyo Dorje and Donyo Dorje's allies in Kham and then G\u00fcshi Khan who used it as a pretext to invade central Tibet in 1639 to attack them both, the B\u00f6npo and the Tsangpa marched on Shigatse where after laying siege to the Tsangpa dynasty, rulers of Central Tibet from Shigatse, supporters of the Karmapa school and rivals to the Gelugpa's strongholds G\u00fcshi Khan who used it as a pretext to invade central Tibet in 1639 to attack them both, the B\u00f6npo and the Tsangpa defeated Karma Tenkyong, broke the power of the Tsang Karma Kagyu in 1642 and ended the Tsangpa dynasty.G\u00fcshi Khan who used it as a pretext to invade central Tibet in 1639 to attack them both, the B\u00f6npo and the Tsangpa's attack on the Tsangpa dynasty, rulers of Central Tibet from Shigatse, supporters of the Karmapa school and rivals to the Gelugpa was made on the orders of Sonam Rabten, the former attendant of the 4th Dalai Lama who had become the Ganden Phodrang treasurer while being publicly and robustly opposed by the Dalai Lama, who, as a matter of conscience, out of compassion and his's vision of tolerance for other religious schools, refused to give permission for more warfare in his's name after the defeat of the Beri king. Sonam Rabten, the former attendant of the 4th Dalai Lama who had become the Ganden Phodrang treasurer deviously went behind Sonam Rabten, the former attendant of the 4th Dalai Lama who had become the Ganden Phodrang treasurer's back to encourage G\u00fcshi Khan who used it as a pretext to invade central Tibet in 1639 to attack them both, the B\u00f6npo and the Tsangpa, to facilitate G\u00fcshi Khan who used it as a pretext to invade central Tibet in 1639 to attack them both, the B\u00f6npo and the Tsangpa's plans and to ensure the attacks took place; for this defiance of Sonam Rabten, the former attendant of the 4th Dalai Lama who had become the Ganden Phodrang treasurer's wishes, Sonam Rabten, the former attendant of the 4th Dalai Lama who had become the Ganden Phodrang treasurer was severely rebuked by his.After Sonam Rabten, the former attendant of the 4th Dalai Lama who had become the Ganden Phodrang treasurer died in 1658, the following year his appointed Sonam Rabten, the former attendant of the 4th Dalai Lama who had become the Ganden Phodrang treasurer's as Sonam Rabten, the former attendant of the 4th Dalai Lama who had become the Ganden Phodrang treasurer's successor. However, after a few months, his younger brother Depa Norbu (aka Nangso Norbu) betrayed his and led a rebellion against the Ganden Phodrang Government. With his younger brother Depa Norbu (aka Nangso Norbu)'s accomplices his younger brother Depa Norbu (aka Nangso Norbu) seized Samdruptse fort at Shigatse and tried to raise a rebel army from Tsang and Bhutan, but his skilfully foiled his younger brother Depa Norbu (aka Nangso Norbu)'s plans without any fighting taking place and his younger brother Depa Norbu (aka Nangso Norbu) had to flee. Four other Desis were appointed after his younger brother Depa Norbu (aka Nangso Norbu): Trinle Gyatso, Lozang Tutop, Lozang Jinpa and Sangye Gyatso.Having thus defeated all the Gelugpa's rivals and resolved all regional and sectarian conflicts G\u00fcshi Khan who used it as a pretext to invade central Tibet in 1639 to attack them both, the B\u00f6npo and the Tsangpa became the undisputed patron of a unified Tibet and acted as a \"Protector of the Gelugpa\", establishing the Khoshut Khanate which covered almost the entire Tibetan plateau, an area corresponding roughly to 'Greater Tibet' including Kham and Amdo, as claimed by exiled groups (see maps). At an enthronement ceremony in Shigatse G\u00fcshi Khan who used it as a pretext to invade central Tibet in 1639 to attack them both, the B\u00f6npo and the Tsangpa conferred full sovereignty over Tibet on the 5th Dalai Lama's, unified for the first time since the collapse of the Tibetan Empire exactly eight centuries earlier. G\u00fcshi Khan who used it as a pretext to invade central Tibet in 1639 to attack them both, the B\u00f6npo and the Tsangpa then retired to Kokonor with G\u00fcshi Khan who used it as a pretext to invade central Tibet in 1639 to attack them both, the B\u00f6npo and the Tsangpa's armies and [according to Smith] ruled Amdo G\u00fcshi Khan who used it as a pretext to invade central Tibet in 1639 to attack them both, the B\u00f6npo and the Tsangpa directly thus creating a precedent for the later separation of Amdo from the rest of Tibet.In this way, G\u00fcshi Khan who used it as a pretext to invade central Tibet in 1639 to attack them both, the B\u00f6npo and the Tsangpa established the 5th Dalai Lama's as the highest spiritual and political authority in Tibet. 'The Great Fifth' became the temporal ruler of Tibet in 1642 and from then on the rule of the Dalai Lama lineage over some, all or most of Tibet lasted with few breaks for the next 317 years, until 1959, when the 14th Dalai Lama fled to India. In 1645, the 5th Dalai Lama's began the construction of the Potala Palace in Lhasa.G\u00fcshi Khan who used it as a pretext to invade central Tibet in 1639 to attack them both, the B\u00f6npo and the Tsangpa died in 1655 and was succeeded by G\u00fcshi Khan who used it as a pretext to invade central Tibet in 1639 to attack them both, the B\u00f6npo and the Tsangpa's descendants Dayan, Tenzin Dalai Khan and Tenzin Wangchuk Khan. However, G\u00fcshi Khan who used it as a pretext to invade central Tibet in 1639 to attack them both, the B\u00f6npo and the Tsangpa's had settled in Amdo but fought amongst G\u00fcshi Khan's other eight sons over territory so the 5th Dalai Lama's sent governors to rule G\u00fcshi Khan's other eight sons in 1656 and 1659, thereby bringing Amdo and thus the whole of Greater Tibet under the 5th Dalai Lama's's personal rule and Gelugpa control. The Mongols in Amdo became absorbed and Tibetanised.In 1636 the Manchus proclaimed the Manchus's dynasty as the Qing dynasty and by 1644 the Manchus had completed the Manchus's conquest of China under the prince regent Dorgon. The following year the Manchus's forces approached Amdo, causing the Oirat and Khoshut Mongols there to submit in 1647 and send tribute. In 1648, after quelling a rebellion of Tibetans of Kansu-Xining, the Qing dynasty invited the 5th Dalai Lama's to visit the Qing dynasty's court at Beijing since the Qing dynasty wished to engender Tibetan influence in the Qing dynasty's dealings with The Mongols in Amdo. the Qing dynasty were aware the 5th Dalai Lama's had extraordinary influence with The Mongols in Amdo and saw relations with the 5th Dalai Lama's as a means to facilitate submission of the Khalka Mongols, traditional patrons of the Karma Kagyu sect.Similarly, since the Tibetan Gelugpa were keen to revive a priest-patron relationship with the dominant power in China and Inner Asia, the the Qing dynasty invitation was accepted. After five years of complex diplomatic negotiations about whether the Tsangpa king in Shigatse or the Tsangpa king in Shigatse's representatives should meet the 5th Dalai Lama's inside or outside the Great Wall, when meet would be astrologically favourable, how meet would be conducted and so on, meet eventually took place in Beijing in 1653.The Shunzhi Emperor was then 16 years old, having in the meantime ascended the throne in 1650 after the death of the prince regent Dorgon. For the Qing dynasty, although the 5th Dalai Lama's was not required to kowtow to the Tsangpa king in Shigatsethe Tsangpa king in Shigatse's , the significance of meet was that of nominal political submission by the 5th Dalai Lama's since Inner Asian heads of state did not travel to meet each other but sent envoys. For Tibetan Buddhist historians, however, meet was interpreted as the start of an era of independent rule of the Dalai Lamas, and of the Qing dynasty patronage alongside that of The Mongols in Amdo.When the 5th Dalai Lama's returned, the 5th Dalai Lama's was granted by the Tsangpa king in Shigatse a golden seal of authority and golden sheets with texts written in Manchu, Tibetan and Han Chinese languages. the 5th Dalai Lama's wanted to use a golden seal of authority right away. However, Lobzang Gyatsho noted that \"The Tibetan version of the inscription of the seal was translated by a Mongol translator but was not a good translation\". After correction, The Tibetan version of the inscription of the seal read: \"The one who resides in the Western peaceful and virtuous paradise is unalterable Vajradhara, Ocen Lama, unifier of the doctrines of the Buddha for all beings under the sky\". The words of the diploma ran: \"Proclamation, to let all the people of the western hemisphere know\". Tibetan historian Nyima Gyaincain points out that based on texts written in Manchu, Tibetan and Han Chinese languagesgolden sheets with texts written in Manchu, Tibetan and Han Chinese languages, the 5th Dalai Lama's was only a subordinate of the Tsangpa king in Shigatse.However, despite such patronising attempts by Chinese officials and historians to symbolically show for the record that Chinese officials and historians held political influence over Tibet, the Tibetan Gelugpa did not accept any such symbols imposed on the Tibetan Gelugpa by the Chinese with this kind of motive. For example, concerning a golden seal of authority, the 5th Dalai Lama's comments in Dukula, the 5th Dalai Lama's's autobiography, on leaving China after this courtesy visit to the Tsangpa king in Shigatse in 1653, that \"the Tsangpa king in Shigatse made the Tsangpa king in Shigatse's men bring a golden seal for the 5th Dalai Lama's that had three vertical lines in three parallel scripts: Chinese, Mongol and Tibetan\". the 5th Dalai Lama's also criticised the words carved on a golden seal of authority as being faultily translated into Tibetan, writing that \"The Tibetan version of the inscription of a golden seal of authority was translated by a Mongol translator but was not a good translation\". Furthermore, when the 5th Dalai Lama's arrived back in Tibet, the 5th Dalai Lama's discarded a golden seal of authority and made a new one for important state usage, writing in the 5th Dalai Lama's's autobiography: \"Leaving out the Chinese characters that were on a golden seal of authority, a new one was carved for stamping documents that dealt with territorial issues. The first imprint of a new one was offered with prayers to the image of Lokeshvara ...\".The 17th-century struggles for domination between the Qing dynasty and the various Mongol groups spilled over to involve Tibet because of the 5th Dalai Lama's's strong influence over The Mongols in Amdo as a result of The Mongols in Amdo's general adoption of Tibetan Buddhism and The Mongols in Amdo's consequent deep loyalty to the 5th Dalai Lama's as The Mongols in Amdo's guru. Until 1674, the 5th Dalai Lama's had mediated in Dzungar Mongol affairs whenever The Mongols in Amdo required the 5th Dalai Lama's to do so, and the Kangxi Emperor, who had succeeded the Shunzhi Emperor in 1661, would accept and confirm the 5th Dalai Lama's's decisions automatically.For the Kangxi Emperor, who had succeeded the Shunzhi Emperor in 1661,, the alliance between the Dzungar Mongols and the Tibetans was unsettling because the Kangxi Emperor, who had succeeded the Shunzhi Emperor in 1661, feared the alliance between the Dzungar Mongols and the Tibetans had the potential to unite all the other Mongol tribes together against the Qing dynasty, including those tribes who had already submitted. Therefore, in 1674, the Kangxi Emperor, who had succeeded the Shunzhi Emperor in 1661,, annoyed by the 5th Dalai Lama's's less than full cooperation in quelling a rebellion against the Qing dynasty in Yunnan, ceased deferring to the 5th Dalai Lama's as regards Mongol affairs and started dealing with The Mongols in Amdo directly.In 1674, the 5th Dalai Lama'sthe 5th Dalai Lama's's , caused Mongol troops to occupy the border post of Dartsedo between Kham and Sichuan, further annoying the Kangxi Emperor who (according to Smith) already considered Tibet as part of the Qing Empire. It also increased the Qing dynasty suspicion about Tibetan relations with the Mongol groups and led the Kangxi Emperor who (according to Smith) already considered Tibet as part of the Qing Empire to seek strategic opportunities to oppose and undermine Mongol influence in Tibet and eventually, within 50 years, to defeat The Mongols in Amdo militarily and to establish the Qing dynasty as sole 'patrons and protectors' of Tibet in The Mongols in Amdo's place.The time of the 5th Dalai Lama's, was a period of rich cultural development. His reign and that of Desi Sangye Gyatso are noteworthy for the upsurge in literary activity and of cultural and economic life that occurred. The same goes for the great increase in the number of foreign visitors thronging Lhasa during His reign and that of Desi Sangye Gyatso as well as for the number of inventions and institutions that are attributed to the 5th Dalai Lama'sthe 5th Dalai Lama's. the 5th Dalai Lama's, the 5th Dalai Lama's composed more literary works than all the other Dalai Lamas combined. Writing on a wide variety of subjects the 5th Dalai Lama's is specially noted for the 5th Dalai Lama's's works on history, classical Indian poetry in Sanskrit and the 5th Dalai Lama's's biographies of notable personalities of the 5th Dalai Lama's's epoch, as well as the 5th Dalai Lama's's own two autobiographies, one spiritual in nature and the other political (see Further Reading). the 5th Dalai Lama's also taught and travelled extensively, reshaped the politics of Inner Asia, unified Tibet, conceived and constructed the Potala Palace and is remembered for establishing systems of national medical care and education.the 5th Dalai Lama's died in 1682. Tibetan historian Nyima Gyaincain points out that the written wills from the 5th Dalai Lama's before the 5th Dalai Lama's died explicitly said the 5th Dalai Lama's's title and authority were from the Tsangpa king in Shigatse, and the 5th Dalai Lama's was subordinate of the Tsangpa king in Shigatse.the 5th Dalai Lama's's was kept secret for fifteen years by the 5th Dalai Lama's's . Desi Sangye Gyatso pretended the 5th Dalai Lama's was in retreat and ruled on Desi Sangye Gyatso's behalf, secretly selecting the 6th Dalai Lama and presenting the 6th Dalai Lama as someone else. Tibetan historian Nyima Gyaincain points out that Desi Sangye Gyatso wanted to consolidate Desi Sangye Gyatso's personal status and power by not reporting the death of [0] to the Tsangpa king in Shigatse, and also collude with the rebellion group of the Qing dynasty, Mongol Dzungar tribe in order to counter influence from another Mongol Khoshut tribe in Tibet. Being afraid of prosecution by the Tsangpa king in Shigatse, Desi Sangye Gyatso explained with fear and trepidation the reason behind Desi Sangye Gyatso's to the Tsangpa king in Shigatse.In 1705, Desi Sangye Gyatso was killed by Lha-bzang Khan of the Mongol Khoshut tribe because of Desi Sangye Gyatso's actions including Desi Sangye Gyatso's illegal action of selecting the 6th Dalai Lama. Since the Tsangpa king in Shigatse was not happy about Desi Sangye Gyatso's , the Tsangpa king in Shigatse gave Lha-bzang Khan of the Mongol Khoshut tribe additional title and golden seal. the Tsangpa king in Shigatse also ordered Lha-bzang Khan of the Mongol Khoshut tribe to arrest the 6th Dalai Lama and send the 6th Dalai Lama to Beijing, the 6th Dalai Lama died when the 6th Dalai Lama was en route to Beijing. Journalist Thomas Laird argues that it was apparently done so that construction of the Potala Palace could be finished, and it was to prevent Tibet's neighbors, the Mongols and the Qing dynasty, from taking advantage of an interregnum in the succession of the Dalai Lamas.", "6th Dalai Lama": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was born near Tawang, now in India, and picked out in 1685 but not enthroned until 1697 when the death of the Fifth was announced. After 16 years of study as a novice monk, in 1702 in [0]'s 20th year [0] rejected full ordination and gave up [0]'s monk's robes and monastic life, preferring the lifestyle of a layman.In 1703 G\u00fcshi Khan's ruling grandson Tenzin Wangchuk Khan was murdered by his brother Lhazang Khan who usurped the Khoshut's Tibetan throne, but unlike his brother Lhazang Khan who usurped the Khoshut's Tibetan throne's four predecessors his brother Lhazang Khan who usurped the Khoshut's Tibetan throne started interfering directly in Tibetan affairs in Lhasa; his brother Lhazang Khan who usurped the Khoshut's Tibetan throne opposed the Fifth Dalai Lama's regent, Desi Sangye Gyatso for the Fifth Dalai Lama's regent, Desi Sangye Gyatso's deceptions and in 1703, with the support of the Kangxi Emperor, his brother Lhazang Khan who usurped the Khoshut's Tibetan throne forced the Fifth Dalai Lama's regent, Desi Sangye Gyatso out of office. Then in 1705, his brother Lhazang Khan who usurped the Khoshut's Tibetan throne used [0]'s escapades as an excuse to seize full control of Tibet. Most Tibetans, though, still supported Most Tibetans's despite [0]'s behaviour and deeply resented his brother Lhazang Khan who usurped the Khoshut's Tibetan throne's interference.When his brother Lhazang Khan who usurped the Khoshut's Tibetan throne was requested by the Tibetans to leave Lhasa politics to the Tibetans and to retire to Kokonor like his brother Lhazang Khan who usurped the Khoshut's Tibetan throne's predecessors, his brother Lhazang Khan who usurped the Khoshut's Tibetan throne quit Kokonor, but only to gather his brother Lhazang Khan who usurped the Khoshut's Tibetan throne's armies in order to return, capture Lhasa militarily and assume full political control of Tibet. the Fifth Dalai Lama's regent, Desi Sangye Gyatso was then murdered by his brother Lhazang Khan who usurped the Khoshut's Tibetan throne or his brother Lhazang Khan who usurped the Khoshut's Tibetan throne's wife, and, in 1706 with the compliance of the Kangxi Emperor [0] was deposed and arrested by his brother Lhazang Khan who usurped the Khoshut's Tibetan throne. his brother Lhazang Khan who usurped the Khoshut's Tibetan throne, then sent [0] to Beijing under escort to appear before the emperor but [0] died mysteriously on the way near Lake Qinghai, ostensibly from illness.Having discredited and deposed [0]his brother Lhazang Khan who usurped the Khoshut's Tibetan throne , and having removed the Fifth Dalai Lama's regent, Desi Sangye Gyatso, his brother Lhazang Khan who usurped the Khoshut's Tibetan throne pressed the Lhasa Gelugpa lamas to endorse a new Dalai Lama in the Fifth Dalai Lama's regent, Desi Sangye Gyatso's place as the true incarnation of the Fifth. the Lhasa Gelugpa lamas eventually nominated a new Dalai Lamahis brother Lhazang Khan who usurped the Khoshut's Tibetan throne's , and his brother Lhazang Khan who usurped the Khoshut's Tibetan throne had a new Dalai Lama installed as the 'real' Sixth Dalai Lama, endorsed by the Panchen Lama and named Yeshe Gyatso in 1707. This choice was in no way accepted by the Tibetan people, however, nor by Lhazang's princely Mongol rivals in Kokonor who resented his usurpation of the Khoshut Tibetan throne as well as his meddling in Tibetan affairs.the Kangxi Emperor concurred with Lhazang's princely Mongol rivals in Kokonor who resented his usurpation of the Khoshut Tibetan throne as well as his meddling in Tibetan affairs, after sending investigators, initially declining to recognize the Fifth Dalai Lama's regent, Desi Sangye Gyatso. the Kangxi Emperor recognized the Fifth Dalai Lama's regent, Desi Sangye Gyatso in 1710, after sending a Qing official party to assist his brother Lhazang Khan who usurped the Khoshut's Tibetan throne in 'restoring order'. a Qing official party were the first Chinese representatives of any sort to officiate in Tibet. At the same time, while the Fifth Dalai Lama's regent, Desi Sangye Gyatso had no political power, the Kangxi Emperor secured from his brother Lhazang Khan who usurped the Khoshut's Tibetan throne in return for this support the promise of regular payments of tribute; this was the first time tribute had been paid to the Manchu by the Mongols in Tibet and the first overt acknowledgment of Qing supremacy over Mongol rule in Tibet.", "7th Dalai Lama": "Dalai Lama is our person to focus on. In 1708, in accordance with an indication given by [0] when quitting Lhasa, a child called Kelzang Gyatso had been born at Lithang in eastern Tibet who was soon claimed by local Tibetans to be [0]'s incarnation. After going into hiding out of fear of Lhazang Khan, a child called Kelzang Gyatso was installed in Lithang in eastern Tibet. Along with some of the Kokonor Mongol princes, rivals of Lhazang Khan, in defiance of the situation in Lhasa the Tibetans of Kham duly recognised a child called Kelzang Gyatso as the Seventh Dalai Lama in 1712, retaining a child called Kelzang Gyatso's birth-name of Kelzang Gyatso. For security reasons a child called Kelzang Gyatso was moved to Derge monastery and eventually, in 1716, now also backed and sponsored by the Kangxi Emperor of China.the Tibetans of Kham asked Dzungars to bring a true Dalai Lama to Lhasa, but the Manchu Chinese did not want to release a child called Kelzang Gyatso to Dzungars. The Regent Taktse Shabdrung and Tibetan officials then wrote a letter to the Kangxi Emperor of China that The Regent Taktse Shabdrung and Tibetan officials recognized a child called Kelzang Gyatso as the Dalai Lama. the Kangxi Emperor of China then granted a child called Kelzang Gyatso a golden seal of authority. a child called Kelzang Gyatso was taken to Amdo at the age of 8 to be installed in Kumbum Monastery with great pomp and ceremony.According to Smith, the Kangxi Emperor of China now arranged to protect a child called Kelzang Gyatso and keep a child called Kelzang Gyatso at Kumbum Monastery in reserve just in case the Kangxi Emperor of China's and [0], were overthrown. According to Mullin, however, the Kangxi Emperor of China's support came from genuine spiritual recognition and respect rather than being politically motivated.In any case, the Kangxi Emperor of China took full advantage of having a child called Kelzang Gyatso under Qing control at Kumbum Monastery after other Mongols from the Dzungar tribes led by Tsewang Rabtan who was related to his supposed ally Lhazang Khan, deceived and betrayed Lhazang Khan by invading Tibet and capturing Lhasa in 1717.These Dzungars, who were Buddhist, had supported the Fifth Dalai Lama and the Fifth Dalai Lama's regent. other Mongols from the Dzungar tribes led by Tsewang Rabtan who was related to his supposed ally Lhazang Khan were secretly petitioned by the Lhasa Gelugpa lamas to invade with the Lhasa Gelugpa lamas's help in order to rid the Lhasa Gelugpa lamas of the Lhasa Gelugpa lamas's and to replace the unpopular Sixth Dalai Lama pretender with a child called Kelzang Gyatso. This plot suited other Mongols from the Dzungar tribes led by Tsewang Rabtan who was related to his supposed ally Lhazang Khan's ambitions and other Mongols from the Dzungar tribes led by Tsewang Rabtan who was related to his supposed ally Lhazang Khan were only too happy to oblige. Early in 1717, after conspiring to undermine Lhazang Khan through treachery other Mongols from the Dzungar tribes led by Tsewang Rabtan who was related to his supposed ally Lhazang Khan entered Tibet from the northwest with a large army, sending a smaller force to Kumbum Monastery to collect a child called Kelzang Gyatso and escort a child called Kelzang Gyatso to Lhasa.By the end of 1717, with Tibetan connivance other Mongols from the Dzungar tribes led by Tsewang Rabtan who was related to his supposed ally Lhazang Khan had captured Lhasa, killed Lhazang Khan and all Lhazang Khan's family and deposed the unpopular Sixth Dalai Lama pretender. other Mongols from the Dzungar tribes led by Tsewang Rabtan who was related to his supposed ally Lhazang Khan's a child called Kelzang Gyatso, however, was intercepted and destroyed by Qing armies alerted by Lhazang Khan. In Lhasa, Lhazang Khan not only failed to produce a child called Kelzang Gyatso but also went on the rampage, looting and destroying the holy places, abusing the populace, killing hundreds of Nyingma monks, causing chaos and bloodshed and turning other Mongols from the Dzungar tribes led by Tsewang Rabtan who was related to his supposed ally Lhazang Khan's Tibetan allies against other Mongols from the Dzungar tribes led by Tsewang Rabtan who was related to his supposed ally Lhazang Khan. the Tibetans of Kham were soon appealing to the Kangxi Emperor of China to rid the Tibetans of Kham of other Mongols from the Dzungar tribes led by Tsewang Rabtan who was related to his supposed ally Lhazang Khan.When other Mongols from the Dzungar tribes led by Tsewang Rabtan who was related to his supposed ally Lhazang Khan had first attacked, Lhazang Khan sent word to Qing for support and Qing quickly dispatched two armies to assist, two armies, but two armies arrived too late. In 1718 two armies were halted not far from Lhasa to be defeated and then ruthlessly annihilated by other Mongols from the Dzungar tribes led by Tsewang Rabtan who was related to his supposed ally Lhazang Khan in the Battle of the Salween River.This humiliation only determined the Kangxi Emperor of China to expel other Mongols from the Dzungar tribes led by Tsewang Rabtan who was related to his supposed ally Lhazang Khan from Tibet once and for all and the Kangxi Emperor of China set about assembling and dispatching a much larger force to march on Lhasa, bringing the Kangxi Emperor of China's with a much larger force. On a much larger force's stately passage from Kumbum Monastery to Lhasa with a child called Kelzang Gyatso being welcomed adoringly at every stage, Khoshut Mongols and Tibetans were happy (and well paid) to join and swell a much larger force's ranks.By the autumn of 1720, other Mongols from the Dzungar tribes led by Tsewang Rabtan who was related to his supposed ally Lhazang Khan had been vanquished from Tibet. Qing imperial forces had entered Lhasa triumphantly with a child called Kelzang Gyatso, acting as patrons of [0], liberators of Tibet, allies of the Tibetan anti-Dzungar forces led by Kangchenas and Polhanas, and allies of the Khoshut Mongol princes. the Tibetans of Kham enthroned a child called Kelzang Gyatso as the Seventh Dalai Lama at the Potala Palace.A new Tibetan government was established consisting of a Kashag or cabinet of Tibetan ministers headed by Kangchenas. a child called Kelzang Gyatso, studied Buddhism. a child called Kelzang Gyatso played a symbolic role in government, and, being profoundly revered by the Mongols, a child called Kelzang Gyatso exercised much influence with Qingthe Mongols.Having vanquished other Mongols from the Dzungar tribes led by Tsewang Rabtan who was related to his supposed ally Lhazang Khan, a large army withdrew leaving [0] as a political figurehead and only a Khalkha Mongol as the Qing amban or representative and a garrison in Lhasa. After the Kangxi Emperor died in 1722 and was succeeded by the Kangxi Emperor's son, the Yongzheng Emperor, these were also withdrawn, leaving the Tibetans of Kham to rule autonomously and showing Qing were interested in an alliance, not conquest. In 1723, after brutally quelling a major rebellion by zealous Tibetan patriots and disgruntled Khoshut Mongols from Amdo who attacked Xining, Qing intervened again, splitting Tibet by putting Amdo and Kham under Qing's own more direct control.Continuing Qing interference in Central Tibetan politics and religion incited an anti-Qing faction to quarrel with the Qing-sympathising Tibetan nobles in power in Lhasa, led by KangchenasPolhanas. quarrel led eventually to the murder of Kangchenas in 1727 and a civil war that was resolved in 1728 with the canny Polhanas, who had sent for Qing assistance, the victor. When the Qing forces did arrive Qing punished the losers and exiled [0] to Kham, under the pretence of sending [0] to Beijing, because [0]'s father had assisted the defeated, anti-Qing faction. [0] studied and taught Buddhism there for the next seven years.In 1735 [0] was allowed back to Lhasa to study and teach, but still under strict control, being mistrusted by Qing, while Polhanas ruled Central Tibet under nominal Qing supervision. Meanwhile, Qing had promoted the Fifth Dalai Lama to be a rival leader and reinstated the ambans and the Lhasa garrison. Polhanas died in 1747. Polhanas was succeeded by his son Gyurme Namgyal, the last dynastic ruler of Tibet, who was far less cooperative with the Qing. his son Gyurme Namgyal, the last dynastic ruler of Tibet, who was far less cooperative with the Qing built a Tibetan army and started conspiring with the Dzungars to rid Tibet of Qing influence. In 1750, when the ambans realised conspiring, the ambans invited his son Gyurme Namgyal, the last dynastic ruler of Tibet, who was far less cooperative with the Qing and personally assassinated his son Gyurme Namgyal, the last dynastic ruler of Tibet, who was far less cooperative with the Qing. Despite [0]'s attempts to calm the angered populace, a vengeful Tibetan mob assassinated the ambans, along with most of the ambans's escort.Qing sent yet another force 'to restore order' but when yet another force arrived the situation had already been stabilised under the leadership of [0]. Just as Lhazang Khan had done with the Fifth Dalai Lama, Qing therefore helped reconstitute the government with [0] presiding over a Kashag of four Tibetans, reinvesting [0] with temporal power in addition to [0]'s already established spiritual leadership. This arrangement, with a Kashag under [0] or [0]'s regent, outlasted the Qing dynasty which collapsed in 1912.The ambans and the Lhasa garrison were reinstated to observe and to some extent supervise affairs. the ambans's influence generally waned with the power of the ambans's empire, which gradually declined after 1792 along with the ambans's influence over Tibet, a decline aided by a succession of corrupt or incompetent ambans. Moreover, there was soon no reason for Qing to fear the Dzungars; by the time [0] died in 1757 at the age of 49, the Dzungars had been practically exterminated through years of genocidal campaigns by Qing armies, and deadly smallpox epidemics, with the survivors being forcibly transported into China. the survivors's emptied lands were then awarded to other peoples.According to Mullin, despite living through such violent times a child called Kelzang Gyatso was perhaps 'the most spiritually learned and accomplished of any Dalai Lama', a child called Kelzang Gyatso's written works comprising several hundred titles including 'some of Tibet's finest spiritual literary achievements'. Despite a child called Kelzang Gyatso's apparent lack of zeal in politics, a child called Kelzang Gyatso is credited with establishing in 1751 the reformed government of Tibet headed by the Dalai Lama, which continued over 200 years until the 1950s, and then in exile. Construction of the Norbulingka, the 'Summer Palace' of the Dalai Lamas in Lhasa was started during a child called Kelzang Gyatso's reign.", "8th Dalai Lama": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was born in Tsang in 1758 and died aged 46 having taken little part in Tibetan politics, mostly leaving temporal matters to [0]'s regents and the ambans.

Since you enjoy such honor, you have to make efforts to promote self-cultivation, study and propagate Buddhism, also help me in promoting Buddhism and goodness of the previous generation of [0] for the people, and also for the long life of the country's\" The Dalai Lama, his later generations and the local government cherished a jade seal of authority and jade sheets of confirmation of authority. a jade seal of authority and jade sheets of confirmation of authority were properly preserved as the root to The Dalai Lama, his later generations and the local government's ruling power.Although [0] lived almost as long as the Seventh [0] was overshadowed by many contemporary lamas in terms of both religious and political accomplishment. According to Mullin, the 14th Dalai Lama has pointed to certain indications that [0] might not have been the incarnation of the Seventh but of Jamyang Chojey, a disciple of Tsongkhapa and founder of Drepung monastery who was also reputed to be an incarnation of Avalokiteshvara. In any case, [0] mainly lived a quiet and unassuming life as a devoted and studious monk, uninvolved in the kind of dramas that had surrounded [0]'s predecessors.Nevertheless, [0] was also said to possess all the signs of being the true incarnation of the Seventh. being was also claimed to have been confirmed by many portents clear to the Tibetans and so, in 1762, at the age of 5, [0] was duly enthroned as [0] at the Potala monastery. At the age of 23 [0] was persuaded to assume the throne as ruler of Tibet with a Regent to assist him and after three years of assume, when a Regent to assist him went to Beijing as ambassador in 1784, [0] continued to rule solo for a further four years. Feeling unsuited to worldly affairs, however, and unhappy in rule, [0] then retired from public office to concentrate on religious activities for [0]'s remaining 16 years until [0]'s death in 1804. [0] is also credited with the construction of the Norbulingka 'Summer Palace' started by [0]'s predecessor in Lhasa and with ordaining some ten thousand monks in [0]'s efforts to foster monasticism.", "9th to 12th Dalai Lamas": "Dalai Lama is our person to focus on. Hugh Richardson's's summary of the period covering the four short-lived, 19th-century Dalai Lamas:After him [the 8th Dalai Lama, Jamphel Gyatso], [0] died before attaining [0]'s majority: one of [0] is credibly stated to have been murdered and strong suspicion attaches to the other. The 11th and 12th were each enthroned but died soon after being invested with power. For 113 years, therefore, supreme authority in Tibet was in the hands of a Lama Regent, except for about two years when a lay noble held office and for short periods of nominal rule by the 11th and 12th Dalai Lamas.[note 1]It has sometimes been suggested that this state of affairs was brought about by the Ambans\u2014the Imperial Residents in Tibet\u2014because it would be easier to control Tibet through a Regent than when a Dalai Lama, with a Dalai Lama's absolute power, was at the head of the government. That is not true. The regular ebb and flow of events followed The regular ebb and flow of events's set course. the Ambans\u2014the Imperial Residents in Tibet, after the first flush of zeal in 1750, grew less and less interested and efficient. Tibet was, to the Ambans\u2014the Imperial Residents in Tibet, exile from the urbanity and culture of Peking; and so far from dominating the Regents, the Ambans\u2014the Imperial Residents in Tibet allowed the Ambans\u2014the Imperial Residents in Tibet to be dominated. It was the ambition and greed for power of Tibetans that led to five successive Dalai Lamas being subjected to continuous tutelage. Thubten Jigme Norbu, the elder brother of the 14th Dalai Lama, described these unfortunate events as follows, although there are few, if any, indications that any of the four short-lived, 19th-century Dalai Lamas were said to be 'Chinese-appointed imposters':It is perhaps more than a coincidence that between the seventh and the thirteenth holders of that office, only one reached only one's majority. the seventh died when the seventh was in the seventh's thirties, Lungtog Gyatso when Lungtog Gyatso was eleven, Tsultrim Gyatso at eighteen, Khadrup Gyatso when Khadrup Gyatso was eighteen also, and Krinla Gyatso at about the same age. The circumstances are such that it is very likely that some, if not all, were poisoned, either by loyal Tibetans for being Chinese-appointed impostors, or by the Chinese for not being properly manageable. Many Tibetans think that this was done at the time when the young [Dalai Lama] made the young [Dalai Lama]'s ritual visit to the Lake Lhamtso. ... Each of the four [Dalai Lamas] to die young expired shortly after Each of the four [Dalai Lamas] to die young's visit to the Lake Lhamtso. Many said expired was because the four short-lived, 19th-century Dalai Lamas were not the true reincarnations, but imposters imposed by the Chinese. Others tell stories of how the cooks of the retinue, which in those days included many Chinese, were bribed to put poison in the young [Dalai Lama]'s] food. The 13th [Dalai Lama] did not visit the Lake Lhamtso until the young [Dalai Lama] was 25 years old. the young [Dalai Lama] was adequately prepared by spiritual exercise and the young [Dalai Lama] also had faithful cooks. the Chinese were disappointed when the young [Dalai Lama] did not die like the young [Dalai Lama]'s predecessors, and the young [Dalai Lama] was to live long enough to give the Chinese much more cause for regret.[note 2] According to Mullin, on the other hand, it is improbable that the Manchus would have murdered any of the four short-lived, 19th-century Dalai Lamas for being 'unmanageable' since it would have been in the Manchus's best interests to have strong Dalai Lamas ruling in Lhasa, Mullin argues, agreeing with Hugh Richardson's that it was rather \"the ambition and greed for power of Tibetans\" that might have caused the four short-lived, 19th-century Dalai Lamas's early deaths.[note 3] Further, if Tibetan nobles murdered any of the four short-lived, 19th-century Dalai Lamas, murdered would more likely have been in order to protect or enhance Tibetan nobles's family interests rather than out of suspicion that the four short-lived, 19th-century Dalai Lamas were seen as Chinese-appointed imposters as suggested by Thubten Jigme Norbu, the elder brother of the 14th Dalai Lama,. the four short-lived, 19th-century Dalai Lamas could also have died from illnesses, possibly contracted from diseases to which the four short-lived, 19th-century Dalai Lamas had no immunity, carried to Lhasa by the multitudes of pilgrims visiting from nearby countries for blessings. Finally, from the Buddhist point of view, Mullin says, \"Simply stated, the four short-lived, 19th-century Dalai Lamas died young because the world did not have enough good karma to deserve the four short-lived, 19th-century Dalai Lamas's presence\".Tibetan historian K. Dhondup, however, in Tibetan historian K. Dhondup's history The Water-Bird and Other Years, based on the Tibetan minister Surkhang Sawang Chenmo's historical manuscripts, disagrees with Mullin's opinion that having strong Dalai Lamas in power in Tibet would have been in China's's best interests. Tibetan historian K. Dhondup notes that many historians are compelled to suspect Manchu foul play in these unfortunate events because the Ambans\u2014the Imperial Residents in Tibet had such latitude to interfere; Manchu, Tibetan historian K. Dhondup says, \"to perpetuate Manchu's domination over Tibetan affairs, did not desire a Dalai Lama who will ascend the throne and become a strong and capable ruler over his own country and peoplea Dalai Lama who will ascend the throne and become a strong and capable ruler over his own country and people's \". The life and deeds of the 13th Dalai Lama [in successfully upholding de facto Tibetan independence from China's from 1912 to 1950] serve as the living proof of this argument, Tibetan historian K. Dhondup points out. This account also corresponds with Thubten Jigme Norbu, the elder brother of the 14th Dalai Lama,'s observations above.Finally, while acknowledging the possibility, the 14th Dalai Lama himself the 14th Dalai Lama himself doubts these unfortunate events were poisoned. the 14th Dalai Lama himself ascribes the probable cause of these unfortunate events to negligence, foolishness and lack of proper medical knowledge and attention. \"Even today\" the 14th Dalai Lama himself is quoted as saying, \"when people get sick, some [Tibetans] will say: 'Just do people's prayers, people don't need medical treatment.'\"Born in Kham in 1805\u20136 amidst the usual miraculous signs the Ninth Dalai Lama, Lungtok Gyatso was appointed by the 7th Panchen Lama's's search team at the age of two and enthroned in the Potala in 1808 at an impressive ceremony attended by representatives from China's, Mongolia, Nepal and Bhutan. Exemption from using Golden Urn was approved by the Emperor. Tibetan historian Nyima Gyaincain and Wang Jiawei point out that the Ninth Dalai Lama, Lungtok Gyatso was allowed to use the seal of authority given to the 7th Panchen Lama's by the Emperor of ChinaHis second Regent Demo Tulku was the biographer of the the 7th Panchen Lama's and 9th Dalai Lamas and though the Ninth Dalai Lama, Lungtok Gyatso died at the age of 9, the Ninth Dalai Lama, Lungtok Gyatso's biography is as lengthy as those of many of the early Dalai Lamas. In 1793 under Manchu pressure, Tibet had closed Tibet's borders to foreigners. In 1811, a British Sinologist, Thomas Manning became the first Englishman to visit Lhasa. Considered to be 'the first Chinese scholar in Europe' a British Sinologist, Thomas Manning stayed five months and gave enthusiastic accounts in a British Sinologist, Thomas Manning's journal of a British Sinologist, Thomas Manning's regular meetings with the Ninth Dalai Lama whom a British Sinologist, Thomas Manning found fascinating: \"beautiful, elegant, refined, intelligent, and entirely self-possessed, even at the age of six\". Three years later in March 1815 a British Sinologist, Thomas Manning caught a severe cold and, leaving the Potala the Potala to preside over the Monlam Prayer Festival, a British Sinologist, Thomas Manning contracted pneumonia from which a British Sinologist, Thomas Manning soon died.Like the 7th Panchen Lama's, the Ninth Dalai Lama, Lungtok Gyatso, was born in Lithang, Kham, where the Third Dalai Lama had built a monastery. It was 1816 and Regent Demo Tulku and the Seventh Panchen Lama followed indications from Nechung, the 'state oracle' which led Regent Demo Tulku and the Seventh Panchen Lama to appoint the Ninth Dalai Lama, Lungtok Gyatso at the age of two. the Ninth Dalai Lama, Lungtok Gyatso passed all the tests and was brought to Lhasa but official recognition was delayed until 1822 when the Ninth Dalai Lama, Lungtok Gyatso was enthroned and ordained by the 7th Panchen Lama's. There are conflicting reports about whether the Chinese 'Golden Urn' was utilised by drawing lots to choose the Ninth Dalai Lama, Lungtok Gyatso, but lot-drawing result was reported and approved by emperor. the Ninth Dalai Lama, Lungtok Gyatso mentioned in the Ninth Dalai Lama, Lungtok Gyatso's biography that the Ninth Dalai Lama, Lungtok Gyatso was allowed to use the golden seal of authority based on the convention set up by the 7th Panchen Lama's. At the investiture, decree of the Emperor of ChinaHis was issued and read out.After 15 years of intensive studies and failing health the Ninth Dalai Lama, Lungtok Gyatso died, in 1837, at the age of 20 or 21. the Ninth Dalai Lama, Lungtok Gyatso identified with ordinary people rather than the court officials and often sat on the Ninth Dalai Lama, Lungtok Gyatso's verandah in the sunshine with the office clerks. Intending to empower the common people the Ninth Dalai Lama, Lungtok Gyatso planned to institute political and economic reforms to share the nation's wealth more equitably. Over this period the Ninth Dalai Lama, Lungtok Gyatso's health had deteriorated, the implication being that the Ninth Dalai Lama, Lungtok Gyatso may have suffered from slow poisoning by Tibetan aristocrats whose interests political and economic reforms to share the nation's wealth more equitably were threatening. the Ninth Dalai Lama, Lungtok Gyatso was also dissatisfied with the Ninth Dalai Lama, Lungtok Gyatso's and scolded his Regent and the Kashag for not alleviating the condition of the common people, who had suffered much in small ongoing regional civil wars waged in Kokonor between Mongols, local Tibetans and the government over territory, and in Kham to extract unpaid taxes from rebellious Tibetan communities.Born in Gathar, Kham in 1838 and soon discovered by the official search committee with the help of Nechung, the 'state oracle', the Ninth Dalai Lama, Lungtok Gyatso was brought to Lhasa in 1841 and recognised, enthroned and named the Ninth Dalai Lama, Lungtok Gyatso by the 7th Panchen Lama's on April 16, 1842, seal of authority and golden sheets were granted on April 16, 1842. Sitting-in-the-bed ceremony was held in July 1844. After that the Ninth Dalai Lama, Lungtok Gyatso was immersed in religious studies under the 7th Panchen Lama's, amongst other great masters. Meanwhile, there were court intrigues and ongoing power struggles taking place between the various Lhasa factions, second Regent Demo Tulku, the Kashag, the powerful nobles and the abbots and monks of the three great monasteries. second Regent Demo Tulku became mistrusted and was forcibly deposed, there were machinations, plots, beatings and kidnappings of ministers and so forth, resulting at last in the 7th Panchen Lama's being appointed as interim Regent to keep the peace. Eventually the Third Reting Rinpoche was made Regent, and in 1855, Khedrup Gyatso, appearing to be an extremely promising prospect, was requested to take the reins of power at the age of 17. Khedrup Gyatso, appearing to be an extremely promising prospect was enthroned as ruler of Tibet in 1855, on orders of the Xianfeng Emperor. Khedrup Gyatso, appearing to be an extremely promising prospect died after just 11 months, no reason for Khedrup Gyatso, appearing to be an extremely promising prospect's being given in these accounts, Shakabpa and Mullin's histories both being based on untranslated Tibetan chronicles. the Third Reting Rinpoche was recalled once again to act as Regent and requested to lead the search for the next incarnation, the twelfth.In 1856, the next incarnation, the twelfth was born in south central Tibet amidst all the usual extraordinary signs. the next incarnation, the twelfth came to the notice of the search team, was investigated, passed the traditional tests and was recognised as the 12th Dalai Lama in 1858. The use of the Chinese Golden Urn at the insistence of the Third Reting Rinpoche, confirmed recognised to the satisfaction of all. Renamed Trinley Gyatso and enthroned on July 3rd, 1860 after emperor's edict from Amban was announced.  the next incarnation, the twelfth underwent 13 years of intensive tutelage and training before stepping up to rule Tibet at the age of 17.His minority seems a time of even deeper Lhasan political intrigue and power struggles than the next incarnation, the twelfth's . By 1862 this led to a coup by Wangchuk Shetra, a minister whom the Regent had banished for conspiring against himWangchuk Shetra, a minister whom the Regent had banished for conspiring against him. Wangchuk Shetra, a minister whom the Regent had banished for conspiring against him contrived to return, deposed the Third Reting Rinpoche, and seized power, appointing Wangchuk Shetra, a minister whom the Regent had banished for conspiring against him 'Desi' or Prime Minister. Wangchuk Shetra, a minister whom the Regent had banished for conspiring against him then ruled with \"absolute power\" for three years, quelling a major rebellion in northern Kham in 1863 and re-establishing Tibetan control over significant Qing-held territory there. Wangchuk Shetra, a minister whom the Regent had banished for conspiring against him died in 1864 and the Kashag re-assumed power. The retired 76th Ganden Tripa, Khyenrab Wangchuk, was appointed as 'Regent' but The retired 76th Ganden Tripa, Khyenrab Wangchuk's role was limited to supervising and mentoring the Ninth Dalai Lama, Lungtok Gyatso.In 1868 Shetra's coup organiser, a semi-literate Ganden monk named Palden Dondrup, seized power by another coup and ruled as a cruel despot for three years, putting opponents to death by having opponents 'sewn into fresh animal skins and thrown in the river'. In 1871, at the request of officials outraged after Shetra's coup organiser, a semi-literate Ganden monk named Palden Dondrup, had done putting with one minister and imprisoned several others, Shetra's coup organiser, a semi-literate Ganden monk named Palden Dondrup, in turn was ousted and committed suicide after a counter-coup coordinated by The retired 76th Ganden Tripa, Khyenrab Wangchuk. As a result of this action The retired 76th Ganden Tripa, Khyenrab Wangchuk is fondly remembered by Tibetans as saviour of the Dalai Lama and Tibet. the Kashag and the Tsongdu or National Assembly were re-instated, and, presided over by a Dalai Lama or a Dalai Lama's Regent, ruled without further interruption until 1959.According to Smith, however, during the Ninth Dalai Lama, Lungtok Gyatso's minority, second Regent Demo Tulku was deposed in 1862 for abuse of authority and closeness with China's, by an alliance of monks and officials called Gandre Drungche (Ganden and Drepung Monks Assembly); an alliance of monks and officials called Gandre Drungche (Ganden and Drepung Monks Assembly) then ruled Tibet for ten years until dissolved, when a National Assembly of monks and officials called the Tsongdu was created and took over. Smith makes no mention of Wangchuk Shetra, a minister whom the Regent had banished for conspiring against him or Shetra's coup organiser, a semi-literate Ganden monk named Palden Dondrup, acting as usurpers and despots in this period.In any case, the Ninth Dalai Lama, Lungtok Gyatso died within three years of assuming power. In 1873, at the age of 20 \"the Ninth Dalai Lama, Lungtok Gyatso suddenly became ill and passed away\". On the cause of the Ninth Dalai Lama, Lungtok Gyatso's , accounts diverge. Mullin relates an interesting theory, based on cited Tibetan sources: out of concern for the monastic tradition, the Ninth Dalai Lama, Lungtok Gyatso chose to die and reincarnate as the 13th Dalai Lama, rather than taking the option of marrying a woman called Rigma Tsomo from Kokonor and leaving an heir to \"oversee Tibet's future\". Shakabpa on the other hand, without citing sources, notes that the Ninth Dalai Lama, Lungtok Gyatso was influenced and manipulated by two close acquaintances who were subsequently accused of having a hand in the Ninth Dalai Lama, Lungtok Gyatso's fatal illness and imprisoned, tortured and exiled as a result.", "13th Dalai Lama": "Dalai Lama is our person to focus on.

Fearing for [0]'s life in the wake of a revolt in Tibet in 1959, [0] fled to India, from where he led a government in exile.With the aim of launching guerrilla operations against the Chinese, the Central Intelligence Agency funded [0]'s administration with US$1.7\u00a0million a year in the 1960s. In 2001 [0] ceded [0]'s partial power over Tibet to an elected parliament of selected Tibetan exiles. [0]'s original goal was full independence for Tibet, but by the late 1980s [0] was seeking high-level autonomy instead. [0] continued to seek greater autonomy from the People's Republic of China, but Dolma Gyari, deputy speaker of an elected parliament of selected Tibetan exiles, stated: \"If the middle path fails in the short term, we will be forced to opt for complete independence or self-determination as per the UN charter\".[0] became one of the two most popular world leaders by 2013 (tied with Barack Obama), according to a poll conducted by Harris Interactive of New York, which sampled public opinion in The United States and six major European countries.In 2014 and 2016, [0] stated that Tibet wants to be part of the People's Republic of China but the People's Republic of China should let Tibet preserve Tibet's culture and script.In 2018, [0] stated that \"Europe belongs to the Europeans\" and that Europe has a moral obligation to aid refugees whose lives are in peril. Further [0] stated that Europe should receive, help and educate refugees but ultimately refugees should return to develop refugees's home countries.

[0] was based at Tashi Lhunpo Monastery, which [0] founded. The Second to the Fifth Dalai Lamas were mainly based at Drepung Monastery outside Lhasa. In 1645, after the unification of Tibet, the Fifth moved to the ruins of a royal fortress or residence on top of Marpori ('Red Mountain') in Lhasa and decided to build a palace on the ruins of a royal fortress or residence on top of Marpori ('Red Mountain') in Lhasa. a royal fortress or residence on top of Marpori ('Red Mountain') in Lhasa, was originally built around 636 AD by the founder of the Tibetan Empire, Songtsen Gampo for the founder of the Tibetan Empire, Songtsen Gampo's Nepalese wife. Amongst the ruins of a royal fortress or residence on top of Marpori ('Red Mountain') in Lhasa there was just a small temple left where Tsongkhapa had given a teaching when Tsongkhapa arrived in Lhasa in the 1380s.the Fifth began construction of a palace on the ruins of a royal fortress or residence on top of Marpori ('Red Mountain') in Lhasa in 1645, carefully incorporating what was left of the founder of the Tibetan Empire, Songtsen Gampo's palace into a palace's structure. From then on and until today, unless on tour or in exile the Dalai Lamas have always spent the Dalai Lamas's winters at a palace and the Dalai Lamas's summers at the Norbulingka palace and park. Both palaces are in Lhasa and approximately 3\u00a0km apart.Following the failed 1959 Tibetan uprising, Dalai Lama sought refuge in India. Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru allowed in Dalai Lama and the Tibetan government officials.

Dalai Lama's residence on the Temple Road in McLeod Ganj, in the Kangra district of Himachal Pradesh in northern India, where the Central Tibetan Administration is established is called the Dalai Lama Temple and is visited by people from across the globe.

By the Himalayan tradition, phowa is the discipline that is believed to transfer the mindstream to the intended body. Upon the death of [0] and consultation with the Nechung Oracle, a search for the Lama's yangsi, or reincarnation, is conducted. The government of the People's Republic of China has stated The government of the People's Republic of China's intention to be the ultimate authority on the selection of the next Dalai Lama.High Lamas may also claim to have a vision by a dream or if [0] was cremated, High Lamas will often monitor the direction of the smoke as an 'indication' of the direction of the expected rebirth.If there is only one boy found, High Lamas will invite Living Buddhas of the three great monasteries, together with secular clergy and monk officials, to 'confirm Living Buddhas of the three great monasteries, together with secular clergy and monk officials's findings' and then report to the Central Government through the Minister of Tibet. Later, a group consisting of the three major servants of [0], eminent officials,[who?] and troops[which?] will collect only one boy and only one boy's family and travel to Lhasa, where the boy would be taken, usually to Drepung Monastery, to study the Buddhist sutra in preparation for assuming the role of spiritual leader of Tibet.If there are several possible claimed reincarnations, however, regents, eminent officials, monks at the Jokhang in Lhasa, where the boy would be taken, and the Minister of Tibet have historically decided on the individual by putting the boys' names inside an urn and drawing one lot in public if it was too difficult to judge the reincarnation initially.In [0]'s autobiography, Freedom in Exile, [0] states that after [0] dies it is possible that [0]'s people will no longer want a Dalai Lama, in which case there would be no search for the Lama's yangsi, or reincarnation. \"So, [0] might take rebirth as an insect, or an animal - whatever would be of most value to the largest number of sentient beings\" (p.237). ", "List of Dalai Lamas": "[0] is our person to focus on. There have been 14 recognised incarnations of [0]:There has also been one non-recognised Dalai Lama, Ngawang Yeshe Gyatso, declared 28 June 1707, when he was 25 years old, by Lha-bzang Khan as the \"true\" 6th Dalai Lama \u2013 however, he was never accepted as such by the majority of the population."}, "Future of the position": {"": "Dalai Lama is our person to focus on. In the mid-1970s, [0] told a Polish newspaper that [0] thought [0] would be the last Dalai Lama. In a later interview published in the English language press [0] stated, \"The Dalai Lama office was an institution created to benefit others. It is possible that The Dalai Lama office will soon have outlived The Dalai Lama office's usefulness.\" These statements caused a furore amongst Tibetans in India. Many could not believe that such an option could even be considered. It was further felt that it was not the Dalai Lama's's decision to reincarnate. Rather, Many felt that since the Dalai Lama's is a national institution it was up to the people of Tibet to decide whether the Dalai Lama's should reincarnate. The government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) has claimed the power to approve the naming of \"high\" reincarnations in Tibet, based on a precedent set by the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing dynasty. the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing dynasty instituted a system of selecting the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama by a lottery that used a Golden Urn with names wrapped in clumps of barley. a system of selecting the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama by a lottery that used a Golden Urn with names wrapped in clumps of barley was used a few times for the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama during the 19th century, but eventually fell into disuse.In 1995, the Dalai Lama's chose to proceed with the selection of the 11th reincarnation of the Panchen Lama without the use of a Golden Urn with names wrapped in clumps of barley, while The government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) insisted that a Golden Urn with names wrapped in clumps of barley must be used.[citation needed] This has led to two rival Panchen Lamas: Gyaincain Norbu as chosen by The government of the People's Republic of China (PRC)'s process, and Gedhun Choekyi Nyima as chosen by the Dalai Lama. However, Gedhun Choekyi Nyima as chosen by the Dalai Lama was abducted by The government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) shortly after being chosen as the Panchen Lama and has not been seen in public since 1995.In September 2007, The government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) said all high monks must be approved by The government of the People's Republic of China (PRC), which would include the selection of the 15th Dalai Lama after the death of [0]. Since by tradition, the Panchen Lama must approve the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama's, approve is another possible method of control. Consequently, the Dalai Lama's has alluded to the possibility of a referendum to determine the 15th Dalai Lama.In response to the possibility of a referendum to determine the 15th Dalai Lama, Tashi Wangdi, the representative of the 14th Dalai Lama, replied that The government of the People's Republic of China (PRC)'s would be meaningless. \"You can't impose an Imam, an Archbishop, saints, any religion...you can't politically impose an Imam, an Archbishop, saints, any religion on people\", said Tashi Wangdi, the representative of the 14th Dalai Lama. \"the Chinese government's selection has to be a decision of the followers of that tradition. The government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) can use The government of the People's Republic of China (PRC)'s political power: force. Again, it's meaningless. Like The government of the People's Republic of China (PRC)'s . And The government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) can't keep The government of the People's Republic of China (PRC)'s in Tibet. The government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) tried to bring their Panchen Lama to their Panchen Lama's monastery many times but people would not see their Panchen Lama. How can you have a religious leader like that?\"The 14th Dalai Lama said as early as 1969 that it was for the Tibetans to decide whether that tradition the Dalai Lama's \"should continue or not\". the Dalai Lama's has given reference to a possible vote occurring in the future for all Tibetan Buddhists to decide whether all Tibetan Buddhists wish to recognize the Dalai Lama's's rebirth. In response to the possibility that The government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) might attempt to choose the Dalai Lama's's successor, the Dalai Lama's said the Dalai Lama's would not be reborn in a country controlled by The government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) or any other country which is not free. According to Robert D. Kaplan, said could mean that \"the next Dalai Lama might come from the Tibetan cultural belt that stretches across Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Nepal, and Bhutan, presumably making the next Dalai Lama even more pro-Indian and hence anti-Chinese\".the Dalai Lama's supported the possibility that the next Dalai Lama could be a woman. As an \"engaged Buddhist\" the Dalai Lama's has an appeal straddling cultures and political systems making the Dalai Lama's one of the most recognized and respected moral voices today. \"Despite the complex historical, religious and political factors surrounding the selection of incarnate masters in that tradition, the Dalai Lama's is open to change\", author Michaela Haas writes."}}
