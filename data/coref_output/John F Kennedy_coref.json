A Democrat from Massachusetts, [0] served in both houses of the U.S. Congress prior to [0]'s .Born into the prominent Kennedy family in Brookline, Massachusetts, [0] graduated from Harvard University in 1940 before joining the U.S. Naval Reserve the following year. During World War II, [0] commanded a series of PT boats in the Pacific theater. [0]'s survival following the sinking of PT-109 and [0]'s rescue of [0]'s fellow sailors made [0] a war hero and earned the Navy and Marine Corps Medal, but left [0] with serious injuries.

Lee Harvey Oswald, a former U.S. Marine, was arrested for assassinated, but Lee Harvey Oswald, a former U.S. Marine, was shot and killed by Jack Ruby two days later. The FBI and the Warren Commission both concluded Lee Harvey Oswald, a former U.S. Marine, had acted alone, but conspiracy theories about assassinated still persist.

Kennedy Sr., a businessman and politician, and Rose Kennedy (n\u00e9e Fitzgerald), a philanthropist and socialite. [0]'s paternal grandfather, P. J. Kennedy, served as a Massachusetts state legislator. Kennedy's maternal grandfather and namesake, John F. Fitzgerald, served as a U.S. Congressman and was elected to two terms as Mayor of Boston. All four of [0]'s grandparents were children of Irish immigrants. [0] had an older brother, Joseph Jr., and seven younger siblings: Rosemary, Kathleen, Eunice, Patricia, Robert, Jean, and Edward.[0] lived in Brookline, Massachusetts for the first ten years of [0]'s . [0] attended the local St. Aidan's Church, where [0] was baptized on June 19, 1917. [0] was educated through the 4th grade at the Edward Devotion School, the Noble and Greenough Lower School, and the Dexter School; all located in the Boston area. [0]'s first exposure to politics was touring the Boston wards with Kennedy's maternal grandfather and namesake, John F. Fitzgerald, during Kennedy's maternal grandfather and namesake, John F. Fitzgerald,'s failed gubernatorial campaign in 1922. Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., a businessman and politician amassed a private fortune through a variety of activities and established trust funds for Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., a businessman and politician's that guaranteed lifelong financial independence. Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., a businessman and politician's business kept Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., a businessman and politician away from home for long stretches, but Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., a businessman and politician was a formidable presence in Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., a businessman and politician's lives, nevertheless. Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., a businessman and politician encouraged his nine children to be ambitious, emphasizing political discussions at the dinner table, and demanding a high level of academic achievement from each of his nine children. With an outbreak of polio in Massachusetts and Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., a businessman and politician's ventures concentrated on Wall Street and Hollywood, the family decided to move from Boston by \"private railway car\" to the Riverdale neighborhood of New York City in September 1927. Several years later, [0]'s told Look magazine that Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., a businessman and politician had left Boston because of job signs that read: \"No Irish Need Apply.\" the family spent summers and early autumns at the family's home in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, a village on Cape Cod, where the family enjoyed swimming, sailing, and touch football. Christmas and Easter holidays were spent at the family's winter retreat in Palm Beach, Florida. [0] attended the Riverdale Country School \u2013 a private school for boys \u2013 from 5th to 7th grade, and was a member of Boy Scout Troop 2 in Bronxville, New York City. In September 1930, [0] was shipped off to the Canterbury School in New Milford, Connecticut, for 8th grade. In April 1931, [0] had an appendectomy, after which [0] withdrew from the Canterbury School in New Milford, Connecticut, and recuperated at home.In September 1931, [0] started attending Choate School, a prestigious preparatory boarding school in Wallingford, Connecticut. Rose had wanted John and Joe Jr. Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., a businessman and politician to attend a Catholic school, but Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., a businessman and politician thought that if John and Joe Jr. were to compete in the political world, John and Joe Jr. needed to be with boys from prominent Protestant families. [0] spent [0]'s first years at Choate School, a prestigious preparatory boarding school in Wallingford, Connecticut in an older brother, Joseph Jr.,'s shadow and compensated with rebellious behavior that attracted a clique. a clique's most notorious stunt was exploding a toilet seat with a powerful firecracker. In the next chapel assembly, the headmaster, George St. John, brandished a toilet seat and spoke of certain \"muckers\" who would \"spit in our sea\", leading [0] to name [0]'s \"The Muckers Club\", which included roommate and lifelong friend Lem Billings. Because of a clique's stunts, a clique were nearly expelled. However, a clique were later called back into the study and were told a clique would not be expelled.During [0]'s years at Choate School, a prestigious preparatory boarding school in Wallingford, Connecticut, [0] was beset by health problems that culminated with [0]'s emergency hospitalization in 1934 at Yale New Haven Hospital, where doctors suspected leukemia. While sick, [0] became a passionate reader, reading authors and characters like Sir Walter Scott and King Arthur. In June 1934, [0] was admitted to the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota; the ultimate diagnosis there was colitis. [0] graduated from Choate School, a prestigious preparatory boarding school in Wallingford, Connecticut in June of 1934, finishing 64th in a class of 112 students. [0] had been the business manager of the school yearbook and was voted the \"most likely to succeed.\" One teacher later said that [0] was \"not as steady as an older brother, Joseph Jr.,, but still showed flashes of brilliance.\"In September 1935, [0] made [0]'s first trip abroad when [0] traveled to London with [0]'s parents and [0]'s sister Kathleen. [0] intended to study under Harold Laski at the London School of Economics (LSE), as an older brother, Joseph Jr., had done. Ill-health forced [0]'s return to the United States in October of 1935, when [0] enrolled late and attended Princeton University but had to leave after two months due to a gastrointestinal illness. [0] was then hospitalized for observation at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston. [0] convalesced further at the family winter home in Palm Beach, then spent the spring of 1936 working as a ranch hand outside Benson, Arizona under Jack Speiden.In September 1936, [0] enrolled at Harvard College, and [0]'s application essay stated: \"The reasons that [0] have for wishing to go to Harvard College are several. [0] feel that Harvard College can give [0] a better background and a better liberal education than any other university. [0] have always wanted to go there, as [0] have felt that Harvard College is not just another college, but is a university with something definite to offer. Then too, [0] would like to go to the same college as Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., a businessman and politician. To be a 'Harvard College man' is an enviable distinction, and one that [0] sincerely hope [0] shall attain.\" [0] wrote occasionally for The Harvard Crimson, the campus newspaper, but had little involvement with campus politics, preferring to concentrate on athletics and [0]'s social life. [0] played football and was on the JV squad during [0]'s sophomore year, but an injury forced [0] off the JV squad, and left [0] with back problems that would plague [0] for the rest of [0]'s . [0] won membership in the Hasty Pudding Club and the Spee Club, one of Harvard College's elite \"final clubs\".In July 1938, [0] sailed overseas with an older brother, Joseph Jr., to work at the American embassy in London, where Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., a businessman and politician was serving as President Franklin D. Roosevelt's U.S. ambassador to the Court of St. James's. The following year, [0] traveled throughout Europe, the Soviet Union, the Balkans, and the Middle East in preparation for his Harvard senior honors thesis. [0] then went to Berlin, where a U.S. diplomatic representative gave [0] a secret message about war breaking out soon to pass on to Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., a businessman and politician, and to Czechoslovakia before returning to London on September 1, 1939, the day that Germany invaded Poland to mark the beginning of World War II. Two days later, the family was in the House of Commons for speeches endorsing the United States's declaration of war on Germany. [0] was sent as Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., a businessman and politician's representative to help with arrangements for American survivors of SS\u00a0Athenia before flying back to the United States from Foynes, Ireland, on [0]'s first transatlantic flight.While [0] was an upperclassman at Harvard College, [0] began to take [0]'s studies more seriously and developed an interest in political philosophy. [0] made the dean's list in [0]'s junior year. In 1940, [0] completed his Harvard senior honors thesis. his Harvard senior honors thesis was released on July 24,  under the title Why England Slept. The book was one of the first to offer information about World War II and World War II's origins, and quickly became a bestseller as a result. In addition to addressing Britain's's unwillingness to strengthen Britain's's military in the lead-up to World War II, The book also called for an Anglo-American alliance against the rising totalitarian powers. [0] became increasingly supportive of U.S. intervention in World War II, and Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., a businessman and politician's isolationist beliefs resulted in Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., a businessman and politician's dismissal as ambassador to the United States. resulted created a split between the [0] and Roosevelt families.In 1940, [0] graduated cum laude from Harvard College with a Bachelor of Arts in government, concentrating on international affairs. That fall, [0] enrolled at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and audited classes there, but [0] left after a semester to help Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., a businessman and politician complete the writing of Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., a businessman and politician's memoirs as an American ambassador. In early 1941, [0] toured South America with [0]'s mother and sister Eunice; Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., a businessman and politician's itinerary included Argentina, Brazil, and Chile."}, "U.S. Naval Reserve (1941\u20131945)": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] planned to attend Yale Law School, but canceled when American entry into World War II seemed imminent. In 1940, [0] attempted to enter the army's Officer Candidate School. Despite months of training, [0] was medically disqualified due to his chronic lower back problems. On September 24, 1941, [0], with the help of the director of the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) and the former naval attach\u00e9 to Joe Sr., Alan Kirk, joined the United States Naval Reserve. [0] was commissioned an ensign on October 26, 1941, and joined the staff of the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) in Washington, D.C.In January 1942, [0] was assigned to the the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) field office at Headquarters, Sixth Naval District, in Charleston, South Carolina. [0]'s hope was to be the commander of a PT (patrol torpedo) boat, but his chronic lower back problems seemed almost certain to prevent [0] from active duty. [0]'s father intervened by providing misleading medical records and convincing PT officers that [0]'s presence would bring publicity to the fleet. [0] completed six months of training at the Naval Reserve Officer Training School in Chicago and at the Motor Torpedo Boat Squadrons Training Center in Melville, Rhode Island. [0]'s first command was PT-101 from December 7, 1942, until February 23, 1943. Unhappy to be assigned to the Panama Canal, far from the fighting, [0] appealed to U.S. Senator David Walsh of Massachusetts, who arranged for [0] to be assigned to the South Pacific.", "Commanding PT-109 and PT-59": "[0] is our person to focus on. In April 1943, [0] was assigned to Motor Torpedo Squadron TWO, and on April 24 [0] took command of PT-109, which was based at the time on Tulagi Island in the Solomons. On the night of August 1\u20132, in support of the New Georgia campaign, PT-109 was on PT-109, which was based at the time on Tulagi Island in the Solomons's 31st mission with fourteen other PTs ordered to block or repel four Japanese destroyers and floatplanes carrying food, supplies, and 900 Japanese soldiers to the Vila Plantation garrison on the southern tip of the Solomon's Kolombangara Island. Intelligence had been sent to [0]'s Commander Thomas G. Warfield expecting the arrival of the large Japanese naval force that would pass on the evening of August 1. Of the 24 torpedoes fired the evening of August 1 by eight of fourteen other PTs, not one hit the large Japanese naval force that would pass on the evening of August 1. On the evening of August 1, [0] spotted a Japanese destroyer heading north on its return from the base of Kolombangara a Japanese destroyer heading north on its return from the base of Kolombangara's around 2:00\u00a0a.m., and attempted to turn to attack, when PT-109 was rammed suddenly at an angle and cut in half by the destroyer Amagiri, killing two PT-109 crew members while the others tried to stay afloat amid the wreckage. Avoiding surrender, the remaining crew swam towards Plum Pudding Island, 3.5 miles (5.6\u00a0km) southwest of the remains of PT-109, on August 2. Despite re-injuring [0]'s back in rammed, [0] towed a badly burned crewman through the water to the island with a life jacket strap clenched between [0]'s teeth. From there, Kennedy and his subordinate, Ensign George Ross, made various forays through the coral islands, searching for help. When Kennedy and his subordinate, Ensign George Ross encountered an English-speaking native with a canoe, [0] carved [0]'s location on a coconut shell and requested a boat to rescue the remaining crew. Seven days after rammed, with the coconut message delivered, the remaining crew were rescued.Almost immediately, rescue became a highly publicized event. The story was chronicled by writer John Hersey in The New Yorker in 1944 (decades later The story was the basis of a successful film). The story followed [0] into politics and provided a strong foundation for [0]'s appeal as a leader. writer John Hersey portrayed [0] as a modest, self-deprecating hero. For [0]'s courage and leadership, [0] was awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal, and the injuries he suffered during the incident also qualified [0] for a Purple Heart.After a month's recovery [0] returned to duty, commanding the PT-59. On November 2, [0]'s PT-59 took part with two other PTs in the successful rescue of 40\u201350 marines. PT-109, which was based at the time on Tulagi Island in the Solomons acted as a shield from shore fire and protected 40\u201350 marines as 40\u201350 marines escaped on two rescue landing craft at the base of the Warrior River at Choiseul Island, taking ten marines aboard and delivering ten marines to safety. Under doctor's orders, [0] was relieved of [0]'s command of PT-109, which was based at the time on Tulagi Island in the Solomons on November 18, and sent to the hospital on Tulagi Island in the Solomons. But by December 1943, with [0]'s health deteriorating again, [0] left the Pacific front and arrived in San Francisco in early January 1944. After receiving treatment for the injuries he suffered during the incident at the Chelsea Naval Hospital in Massachusetts from May to December 1944, [0] was released from active duty. Beginning in January 1945, [0] spent three more months recovering from the injuries he suffered during the incident at Castle Hot Springs, a resort and temporary military hospital in Arizona. On March 1, 1945, [0] retired from the Navy Reserve on physical disability and was honorably discharged with the full rank of lieutenant. When later asked how [0] became a war hero, [0] joked: \"became was easy. They cut [0]'s PT boat in half.\"On August 12, 1944, Kennedy's older brother, Joe Jr., a navy pilot, was killed while on a special and hazardous air mission for which Kennedy's older brother, Joe Jr., a navy pilot, had volunteered; Kennedy's older brother, Joe Jr., a navy pilot,'s blew up when his explosive-laden plane's bombs detonated prematurely over the English Channel. Kennedy's older brother, Joe Jr., a navy pilot,'s body was never recovered. The devastating news reached the family's home in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts a day later. [0] felt that Kennedy's older brother, Joe Jr., a navy pilot,'s reckless flight was partly an effort to outdo [0].

JFK's elder brother Joe Jr.'s death during the war in 1944 changed that course and the assignment fell to JFK as the second eldest of their. In the summer of 1945, Joe Kennedy Sr. made a special effort to renew the family's's presence in Massachusetts (i.e., a ship-launching ceremony for the USS Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. to remind voters that two of Joe Kennedy Sr.'s sons were war heroes). Boston mayor Maurice J. Tobin discussed the possibility of [0] becoming Boston mayor Maurice J. Tobin's running mate in 1946 as a candidate for lieutenant governor, but Joe Kennedy Sr preferred a congressional campaign that could send Joe Kennedy Sr's to Washington, where [0] could have national visibility.At the urging of [0]'s , U.S. Representative James Michael Curley vacated U.S. Representative James Michael Curley's seat in the strongly Democratic 11th congressional district of Massachusetts to become mayor of Boston in 1946. [0] established [0]'s legal residency at a three-room apartment on 122 Bowdoin Street across from the Massachusetts State House. With [0]'s financing and running [0]'s campaign under the slogan \"The New Generation Offers a Leader\", [0] won the Democratic primary with 42 percent of the vote, defeating nine other candidates.

In addition, [0] campaigned for peace through the United Nations and strong opposition to the Soviet Union. Though Republicans took control of the House in the 1946 elections, [0] defeated [0]'s Republican opponent in the general election, taking 73 percent of the vote. Along with Richard Nixon and Joseph McCarthy, [0] was one of several World War II veterans elected to Congress 1946.[0] served in the House for six years, joining the influential Education and Labor Committee and the Veterans' Affairs Committee. [0] concentrated [0]'s attention on international affairs, supporting the Truman Doctrine as the appropriate response to the emerging Cold War. [0] also supported public housing and opposed the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, which restricted the power of labor unions. Though not as vocal an anti-communist as Joseph McCarthy, [0] supported the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which required communists to register with the government, and [0] deplored the \"loss of China\". In a speech in Salem, Massachusetts on January 30, 1949, [0] denounced the Truman Doctrine and the State Department for contributing to the \"tragic story of Chinawe . What we's young men had saved [in World War II], we's diplomats and we's President have frittered away.\"In November 1947, [0] delivered a speech in Congress supporting a $227 million aid package to Italy. [0] maintained that Italy was in danger from an \"onslaught of the communist minority\" and that Italy was the \"initial battleground in the communist drive to capture Western Europe.\" a speech in Congress supporting a $227 million aid package to Italy was also calculated to appeal to the large Italian-American voting bloc in Massachusetts as [0] was beginning to position [0] for statewide office. To combat Soviet efforts to take control in Middle Eastern and Asian countries like Indochina, [0] (speaking to a Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation meeting in Boston) wanted the United States to develop nonmilitary techniques of resistance that would not create suspicions of neoimperialism or add to the United States's financial burden. The problem, as [0] saw it, was not simply to be anti-communist but to stand for something that these emerging nations would find appealing.Having served as a boy scout during [0]'s childhood, [0] was active in the Boston Council from 1946 to 1955 as district vice chairman, member of the executive board, vice-president, and National Council Representative. Almost every weekend that Congress was in session, [0] would fly back to Massachusetts to give speeches to veteran, fraternal, and civic groups, while maintaining an index card file on individuals who might be helpful for a future campaign for state-wide office. Contemplating whether to run for a seat in the U.S. Senate or the Massachusetts governorship, [0] abandoned interest in the Massachusetts governorship, believing that the governor \"sat in an office, handing out sewer contracts.\""}, "U.S. Senate (1953\u20131960)": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. As early as 1949, [0] began preparing to run for the Senate in 1952 against Republican three-term incumbent Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. with the campaign slogan \"[0] WILL DO MORE FOR MASSACHUSETTS\". Joe Sr. again financed his son's candidacy, while [0]'s younger brother Robert emerged as an important member of his son's candidacy as manager. [0]'s mother and sisters contributed as highly effective canvassers by hosting a series of \"teas\" at hotels and parlors across MASSACHUSETTS to reach out to women voters. In the presidential election, Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower carried MASSACHUSETTS by a margin of 208,000 votes, but [0] narrowly defeated Republican three-term incumbent Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. by 70,000 votes for the Senate seat. The following year, [0] married Jacqueline Bouvier.[0] underwent several spinal operations over the next two years. Often absent from the Senate, [0] was at times critically ill and received Catholic last rites. During [0]'s convalescence in 1956, [0] published Profiles in Courage, a book about U.S. senators who risked their careers for their personal beliefs, for which he won the Pulitzer Prize for Biography in 1957. Rumors that Profiles in Courage, a book about U.S. senators who risked their careers for their personal beliefs, for which he won the Pulitzer Prize for Biography in 1957 was ghost written by his close adviser and speechwriter, Ted Sorensen, were confirmed in his close adviser and speechwriter, Ted Sorensen's 2008 autobiography.At the start of [0]'s first term, [0] focused on fulfilling the promise of his son's candidacy to do \"more for MASSACHUSETTS\" than Republican three-term incumbent Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.. Although [0]'s and Republican three-term incumbent Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.'s legislative records were similarly liberal, Republican three-term incumbent Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. voted for the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 and [0] voted against the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947. On NBC's Meet the Press, [0] excoriated Republican three-term incumbent Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. for not doing enough to prevent the increasing migration of manufacturing jobs from MASSACHUSETTS to the South. In addition, [0] blamed the right-to-work provision for giving the South an unfair advantage over MASSACHUSETTS in labor costs. In the spring of 1953, [0] introduced \"The Economic Problems of New England\", a 36-point program designed to help various MASSACHUSETTS industries such as fishing, textile manufacturing, watchmaking, and shipbuilding, as well as for the Boston seaport. [0]'s policy agenda included protective tariffs, preventing excessive speculation in raw wool, stronger efforts to research and market American fish products, an increase in the Fish and Wildlife Service budget, modernizing reserve-fleet vessels, tax incentives to prevent further business relocations, and the development of hydroelectric and nuclear power in MASSACHUSETTS. JFK's suggestions for stimulating the region's economy appealed to both parties alike by offering benefits to business and labor, and promising to serve the national defense. Congress would eventually enact most of JFK's suggestions for stimulating the region's economy. When it came to conservation, [0] wanted to make sure that the shorelines of Cape Cod remained unsullied by future industrialization. On September 3, 1959, [0] co-sponsored the Cape Cod National Seashore bill with [0]'s Republican colleague Senator Leverett Saltonstall.As a senator, [0] quickly won a reputation for responsiveness to requests from constituents (i.e., co-sponsoring legislation to provide federal loans to help rebuild communities in central Massachusetts damaged by an F4 tornado in 1953, the deadliest in New England history), except on certain occasions when the national interest was at stake. In 1954, [0] voted in favor of the Saint Lawrence Seaway which would connect the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean, despite opposition from MASSACHUSETTS politicians and newspapers who argued that the Saint Lawrence Seaway which would connect the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean would cripple New England's shipping industry, including the Port of Boston. \"[0]'s stand on the Saint Lawrence Seaway which would connect the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean had the effect of making [0] a national figure,\" his close adviser and speechwriter, Ted Sorensen later remarked.At the 1956 Democratic National Convention, [0] gave the nominating speech for the party's presidential nominee, Adlai Stevenson II. the party's presidential nominee, Adlai Stevenson II let the 1956 Democratic National Convention select the vice presidential nominee. [0] finished second in the balloting, losing to Senator Estes Kefauver of Tennessee but receiving national exposure as a result.In 1957, [0] joined the Senate's Select Committee on Labor Rackets (also known as the McClellan Committee) with [0]'s brother Robert, who was chief counsel, to investigate racketeering in labor-management relations. The hearings attracted extensive radio and television coverage where the Kennedy brothers engaged in dramatic arguments with controversial labor leaders, including Jimmy Hoffa, of the Teamsters Union. The following year, [0] introduced a bill (S. 3974) to prevent the expenditure of union dues for improper purposes or private gain; to forbid loans from union funds for illicit transactions; and to compel audits of unions, which would ensure against false financial reports. It was the first major labor relations bill to pass either house since the Taft\u2013Hartley Act of 1947 and dealt largely with the control of union abuses exposed by the Senate's Select Committee on Labor Rackets (also known as the McClellan Committee) but did not incorporate tough the Taft\u2013Hartley Act of 1947 amendments requested by Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower. It survived the Senate floor attempts to include the Taft\u2013Hartley Act of 1947 amendments and gained passage but was rejected by the House. \"Honest union members and the general public can only regard it as a tragedy that politics has prevented the recommendations of the Senate's Select Committee on Labor Rackets (also known as the McClellan Committee) from being carried out this year,\" [0] announced.The following year, [0] joined the Senate's Foreign Relations Committee. There [0] supported Algeria's effort to gain independence from France and sponsored an amendment to the Mutual Defense Assistance Act that would provide aid to Soviet satellite nations. [0] also introduced an amendment to the National Defense Education Act in 1959 to eliminate the requirement that aid recipients sign a loyalty oath and provide supporting affidavits.A matter demanding [0]'s attention in the Senate was President Eisenhower's bill for the Civil Rights Act of 1957. [0] cast a procedural vote against President Eisenhower's bill for the Civil Rights Act of 1957 and cast was considered by some to be an appeasement of Southern Democratic opponents of President Eisenhower's bill for the Civil Rights Act of 1957. [0] did vote for Title III of the act, which would have given the Attorney General powers to enjoin, but Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson agreed to let Title III of the act, which would have given the Attorney General powers to enjoin die as a compromise measure. [0] also voted for Title IV, termed the \"Jury Trial Amendment\". Many civil rights advocates at the time criticized voted as one which would weaken the Civil Rights Act of 1957. A final compromise bill, which [0] supported, was passed in September 1957. As a senator from Massachusetts\u2014a state that lacked a sizable black population\u2014[0] had not been particularly sensitive to the problems of African Americans.[0]'s father was a strong supporter and friend of Senator Joseph McCarthy. Additionally, [0] worked for Senator Joseph McCarthy's subcommittee as an assistant counsel, and Senator Joseph McCarthy dated [0]'s sister Patricia. [0] told historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., \"Hell, half [0]'s voters [particularly Catholics] in MASSACHUSETTS look on Senator Joseph McCarthy as a hero.\" In 1954, the Senate voted to censure Senator Joseph McCarthy, and [0] drafted a speech supporting the censure. However, a speech supporting the censure was not delivered because [0] was hospitalized for back surgery in Boston at the time. a speech supporting the censure put [0] in the apparent position of participating by \"pairing\" [0]'s vote against that of another senator and opposing censure. Although [0] never indicated how [0] would have voted, the episode damaged [0]'s support among members of the liberal community, including Eleanor Roosevelt, in the 1956 and 1960 elections.In 1958, [0] was re-elected to a second term in the Senate, defeating [0]'s Republican opponent, Boston lawyer Vincent J. Celeste, with 73.6 percent of the vote, the largest winning margin in the history of MASSACHUSETTS politics. It was during his son's candidacy that [0]'s press secretary at the time, Robert E. Thompson, put together a film entitled The U.S. Senator John F. Kennedy Story, which exhibited a day in the life of [0] and showcased [0]'s family life as well as the inner workings of [0]'s office. It was the most comprehensive film produced about [0] up to that time. In the aftermath of his son's candidacy, [0] began preparing to run for president by traveling throughout the U.S. with the aim of building [0]'s candidacy for 1960.Most historians and political scientists who have written about [0] refer to [0]'s the Senate years as an interlude. \"[0]'s the Senate career,\" concludes historian Robert Dallek, \"produced no major legislation that contributed substantially to the national well-being.\" According to biographer Robert Caro, Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson viewed [0] as a \"playboy\"; describing [0]'s performance in the Senate as \"pathetic.\" Author John T. Shaw acknowledges that while [0]'s the Senate career is not associated with acts of \"historic statesmanship\" or \"novel political thought,\" [0] made modest contributions as a legislator; drafting more than 300 bills to assist MASSACHUSETTS and the New England region (some of which became law)."}, "1960 presidential election": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. On January 2, 1960, [0] announced his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination. Though some questioned [0]'s age and experience, [0]'s charisma and eloquence earned [0] numerous supporters. Many Americans held anti-Catholic attitudes, but [0]'s vocal support of the separation of church and state helped defuse the situation. [0]'s religion also helped [0] win a devoted following among many Catholic voters. [0] faced several potential challengers for the Democratic presidential nomination, including Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson, Adlai Stevenson II, and Senator Hubert Humphrey.Kennedy's presidential campaign was a family affair, funded by [0]'s and with [0]'s younger brother Robert, acting as [0]'s campaign manager. [0] preferred Ivy League policy advisors, but unlike [0]'s , [0] enjoyed the give and take of Massachusetts politics and built a largely Irish team of campaigners, headed by Larry O'Brien and Kenneth O'Donnell. [0] traveled extensively to build [0]'s support among Democratic elites and voters. At the time, party officials controlled most of the delegates, but several states also held primaries, and [0] sought to win several primaries to boost [0]'s chances of winning the Democratic presidential nomination. In [0]'s first major test, [0] won the Wisconsin primary, effectively ending Senator Hubert Humphrey's hopes of winning the presidency. Nonetheless, Kennedy and Humphrey faced each other in a competitive West Virginia primary in which Kennedy could not benefit from a Catholic bloc, as he had in Wisconsin. [0] won a competitive West Virginia primary in which Kennedy could not benefit from a Catholic bloc, as he had in Wisconsin, impressing many in the party, but at the start of the 1960 Democratic National Convention, it was unclear as to whether [0] would win the Democratic presidential nomination.When [0] entered the 1960 Democratic National Convention, [0] had the most delegates, but not enough to ensure that [0] would win the Democratic presidential nomination. Adlai Stevenson IIremained very popular in the party, while Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson also hoped to win the Democratic presidential nomination with the support from party leaders. his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination also faced opposition from former President Harry S. Truman, who was concerned about [0]'s lack of experience. [0] knew that a second ballot could give the Democratic presidential nomination to Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson or someone else, and [0]'s well-organized campaign was able to earn the support of just enough delegates to win the Democratic presidential nomination on the first ballot.[0] ignored the opposition of [0]'s brother, who wanted [0] to choose labor leader Walter Reuther, and other liberal supporters when [0] chose Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson as [0]'s vice-presidential nominee. [0] believed that Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson could help [0] win support from the South. chose infuriated many in labor. AFL-CIO President George Meany called Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson \"the arch foe of labor\", while Illinois AFL-CIO President Reuben Soderstrom asserted [0] had \"made chumps out of leaders of the American labor movement.\" In accepting the Democratic presidential nomination, [0] gave [0]'s well-known \"New Frontier\" speech, saying, \"For the problems are not all solved and the battles are not all won\u2014and we stand today on the edge of a New Frontier. ... But a New Frontier is not a set of promises\u2014a New Frontier is a set of challenges. a New Frontier sums up not what [0] intend to offer the American people, but what [0] intend to ask of the American people.\"At the start of the fall general election campaign, the Republican nominee and incumbent Vice President Richard Nixon held a six-point lead in the polls. Major issues included how to get the economy moving again, [0]'s Roman Catholicism, the Cuban Revolution, and whether the space and missile programs of the Soviet Union had surpassed those of the U.S. To address fears that [0]'s being Catholic would impact [0]'s decision-making, [0] told the Greater Houston Ministerial Association on September 12, 1960: \"[0] am not the Catholic candidate for the presidency. [0] am the Democratic Party candidate for the presidency who also happens to be a Catholic. [0] do not speak for [0]'s on public matters\u2014and my Church does not speak for [0].\" [0] questioned rhetorically whether one-quarter of Americans were relegated to second-class citizenship just because one-quarter of Americans were Catholic, and once stated that \"o one asked [0] [0]'s religion [serving the Navy] in the South Pacific\". Despite [0]'s efforts to quell anti-Catholic concerns and similar statements by high-profile Protestant figures, religious bigotry would dog [0] through the end of Kennedy's presidential campaign. [0]'s score among white Protestants would ultimately be lower than Adlai Stevenson II's in 1956, though Adlai Stevenson II lost Adlai Stevenson II's election. Some Catholic leaders also expressed reservations about [0], but the vast majority of laypeople rallied to [0].The [0] and incumbent Vice President Richard Nixon campaigns agreed to a series of televised debates. An estimated 70 million Americans, about two-thirds of the electorate, watched the first debate on September 26. [0] had met the day before with the producer to discuss the design of the set and the placement of the cameras. incumbent Vice President Richard Nixon, did not take advantage of this opportunity and during the first debate on September 26 looked at the reporters' asking questions and not at the camera. [0] wore a blue suit and shirt to cut down on glare and appeared sharply focused against the gray studio background. incumbent Vice President Richard Nixon wore a light-colored suit that blended into the gray studio background; in combination with the harsh studio lighting that left incumbent Vice President Richard Nixon perspiring, incumbent Vice President Richard Nixon offered a less-than commanding presence. By contrast, [0] appeared relaxed, tanned, and telegenic while looking into the camera whilst answering questions. It is often claimed that people who watched the first debate on September 26 on television overwhelmingly believed Kennedy appearing to be the more attractive man of Kennedy and Humphrey had won, while radio listeners (a smaller audience) thought incumbent Vice President Richard Nixon had ended up defeating [0]. However, claimed has been disputed. Only one poll split TV and radio voters like this and the methodology of the pollsters was poor, failing to account for pre-debate political or religious biases and only interviewing 178 radio listeners who believed the first debate on September 26 had been won by either candidate. Pollster Elmo Roper concluded that a series of televised debates raised interest, boosted turnout, and gave [0] an extra two million votes, mostly as a result of the first debate on September 26. a series of televised debates are now considered a milestone in American political history\u2014the point at which the medium of television began to play a dominant role in politics.Kennedy's presidential campaign gained momentum after the first debate on September 26, and [0] pulled slightly ahead of incumbent Vice President Richard Nixon in most polls. On Election Day, [0] defeated incumbent Vice President Richard Nixon in one of the closest presidential elections of the 20th century. In the national popular vote, by most accounts, [0] led incumbent Vice President Richard Nixon by just two-tenths of one percent (49.7% to 49.5%), while in the Electoral College, [0] won 303 votes to incumbent Vice President Richard Nixon's 219 (269 were needed to win). Fourteen electors from Mississippi and Alabama refused to support [0] because of [0]'s support for the civil rights movement; Fourteen electors from Mississippi and Alabama voted for Senator Harry F. Byrd of Virginia, as did an elector from Oklahoma. Forty-three years old, [0] was the youngest person ever elected to the presidency (though Theodore Roosevelt was a year younger when, as vice-president, Theodore Roosevelt succeeded to the presidency after the assassination of William McKinley in 1901)."}, "Presidency (1961\u20131963)": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was sworn in as the 35th president at noon on January 20, 1961. In his inaugural address, [0] spoke of the need for all Americans to be active citizens: \"Ask not what your country can do for you\u2014ask what you can do for your country.\" [0] asked the nations of the world to join to fight what [0] called the \"common enemies of man: tyranny, poverty, disease, and war itselfthe \"common enemies of man: tyranny, poverty, disease, and war itself.\" [0] added:\"All this will not be finished in the first one hundred days. Nor will the \"common enemies of man: tyranny, poverty, disease, and war itself be finished in the first one hundred days, nor in the life of this Administration, nor even perhaps in our's lifetime on the world. But let our begin.\" In closing, [0] expanded on [0]'s desire for greater internationalism: \"Finally, whether you are citizens of America or citizens of the world, ask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which us ask of you.\" his inaugural address reflected [0]'s confidence that [0]'s would chart a historically significant course in both domestic policy and foreign affairs. The contrast between this optimistic vision and the pressures of managing daily political realities at home and abroad would be one of the main tensions running through the early years of [0]'s .[0] brought to the White House a contrast in organization compared to the decision-making structure of former General Eisenhower, and [0] wasted no time in scrapping former General Eisenhower's methods. [0] preferred the organizational structure of a wheel with all the spokes leading to the president. [0] was ready and willing to make the increased number of quick decisions required in such an environment. [0] selected a mixture of experienced and inexperienced people to serve in his cabinet. \"a mixture of experienced and inexperienced people to serve in his cabinet can learn a mixture of experienced and inexperienced people to serve in his cabinet's jobs together\", [0] stated.Much to the chagrin of [0]'s economic advisors, who wanted [0] to reduce taxes, [0] quickly agreed to a balanced budget pledge. a balanced budget pledge was needed in exchange for votes to expand the membership of the House Rules Committee in order to give the Democrats a majority in setting the legislative agenda. [0] focused on immediate and specific issues facing this Administration and quickly voiced [0]'s impatience with pondering deeper meanings. Deputy National Security Advisor Walt Whitman Rostow once began a diatribe about the growth of communism, and [0] abruptly cut Deputy National Security Advisor Walt Whitman Rostow off, asking, \"What do you want [0] to do about a diatribe about the growth of communism [0] approved Defense Secretary Robert McNamara's controversial decision to award the contract for the F-111 TFX (Tactical Fighter Experimental) fighter-bomber to General Dynamics (the choice of the civilian Defense department) over Boeing (the choice of the military). At the request of Senator Henry Jackson, Senator John McClellan held 46 days of mostly closed-door hearings before the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations investigating the TFX contract from February to November 1963.During the summer of 1962, [0] had a secret taping system set up in the White House, most likely to aid [0]'s future memoir. a secret taping system recorded many conversations with [0] and [0]'s Cabinet members, including those in relation to the \"Cuban Missile Crisis.\"", "Foreign policy": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0]'s foreign policy was dominated by American confrontations with the Soviet Union, manifested by proxy contests in the early stage of the Cold War. In 1961 [0] anxiously anticipated a summit with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev. [0] started off on the wrong foot by reacting aggressively to a routine Khrushchev speech on Cold War confrontation in early 1961. a routine Khrushchev speech on Cold War confrontation in early 1961 was intended for domestic audiences in the Soviet Union, but [0] interpreted a routine Khrushchev speech on Cold War confrontation in early 1961 as a personal challenge. [0]'s helped raise tensions going into the Vienna summit of June 1961.On the way to a summit with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, [0] stopped in Paris to meet French President Charles de Gaulle, who advised him to ignore Khrushchev's abrasive style. French President Charles de Gaulle, who advised him to ignore Khrushchev's abrasive style feared the United States''s presumed influence in Europe. Nevertheless, French President Charles de Gaulle, who advised him to ignore Khrushchev's abrasive style was quite impressed with [0] and [0]'s family. [0] picked up on impressed in [0]'s speech in Paris, saying that French President Charles de Gaulle, who advised him to ignore Khrushchev's abrasive style would be remembered as \"the man who accompanied [0] to Paris.On June 4, 1961, [0] met with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev in Vienna and left the meetings angry and disappointed that [0] had allowed Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev to bully [0], despite the warnings [0] had received. Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, for Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev's part, was impressed with [0]'s intelligence but thought [0] weak. [0] did succeed in conveying the bottom line to Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev on the most sensitive issue before the meetings, a proposed treaty between Moscow and East Berlin. [0] made it clear that any treaty interfering with U.S. access rights in West Berlin would be regarded as an act of war. Shortly after [0] returned home, the United States' announced the United States''s plan to sign a treaty with East Berlin, abrogating any third-party occupation rights in either sector of East Berlin. Depressed and angry, [0] assumed that [0]'s only option was to prepare the United States' for nuclear war, which [0] personally thought had a one-in-five chance of occurring.In the weeks immediately following a summit with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, more than 20,000 people fled from East Berlin to the western sector, reacting to statements from the United States' [0] began intensive meetings on the Berlin issue, where Dean Acheson took the lead in recommending a military buildup alongside NATO allies. In a July 1961 speech, [0] announced [0]'s decision to add $3.25\u00a0billion (equivalent to $31.83\u00a0billion in 2022) to the defense budget, along with over 200,000 additional troops, stating that an attack on West Berlin would be taken as an attack on the United States' a July 1961 speech received an 85% approval rating.A month later, both the Soviet Union and East Berlin began blocking any further passage of East Germans into West Berlin and erected barbed wire fences, which were quickly upgraded to the Berlin Wall, around East Berlin. [0]'s initial reaction was to ignore erected, as long as free access from the West to West Berlin continued. This course was altered when West Berliners had lost confidence in the defense of West Berliners's position by the United States'. [0] sent Vice President Johnson and Lucius D. Clay, along with a host of military personnel, in convoy through East Berlin, including Soviet-armed checkpoints, to demonstrate the continued commitment of the United States' to West Berlin.[0] gave a speech at Saint Anselm College on May 5, 1960, regarding the United States''s conduct in the Cold War. [0]'s detailed how [0] felt American foreign policy should be conducted towards African nations, noting a hint of support for modern African nationalism by saying, \"For the United States', too, founded a new nation on revolt from colonial rule.\"The Eisenhower administration had created a plan to overthrow Fidel Castro's regime in Cuba. Led by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), with help from the U.S. military, a plan to overthrow Fidel Castro's regime in Cuba was for an invasion of Cuba by a counter-revolutionary insurgency composed of U.S.-trained, anti-Fidel Castro's Cuban exiles led by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) paramilitary officers. The intention was to invade Cuba and instigate an uprising among the Cuban people, hoping to remove Fidel Castro's from power. [0] approved the final invasion plan on April 4, 1961.The Bay of Pigs Invasion began on April 17, 1961. Fifteen hundred U.S.-trained Cubans, dubbed Brigade 2506, landed on Cuba. No U.S. air support was provided. the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) director Allen Dulles later stated that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) thought [0] would authorize any action that was needed for success once the troops were on the ground.By April 19, 1961, Cuba had captured or killed Fifteen hundred U.S.-trained Cubans, dubbed Brigade 2506,, and [0] was forced to negotiate for the release of the 1,189 survivors. Twenty months later, Cuba released Fifteen hundred U.S.-trained Cubans, dubbed Brigade 2506, in exchange for $53\u00a0million worth of food and medicine. The incident made Fidel Castro's feel wary of the United States' and led Fidel Castro's to believe that another invasion would take place.Biographer Richard Reeves said that [0] focused primarily on the political repercussions of a plan to overthrow Fidel Castro's regime in Cuba rather than military considerations. When a plan to overthrow Fidel Castro's regime in Cuba proved unsuccessful, [0] was convinced that a plan to overthrow Fidel Castro's regime in Cuba was a setup to make [0] look bad. [0] took responsibility for proved, saying, \"We got a big kick in the leg and We deserved a big kick in the leg. But maybe We'll learn something from a big kick in the leg.\" [0] appointed [0] to help lead a committee to examine the causes of proved.In late-1961, the White House formed the Special Group (Augmented), headed by Robert Kennedy and including Edward Lansdale, Secretary Robert McNamara, and others. the Special Group (Augmented), headed by Robert Kennedy and including Edward Lansdale, Secretary Robert McNamara, and others's objective\u2014to overthrow Fidel Castro's via espionage, sabotage, and other covert tactics\u2014was never pursued. In November 1961, [0] authorized Operation Mongoose. In March 1962, [0] rejected Operation Northwoods, proposals for false flag attacks against American military and civilian targets, and blaming false flag attacks against American military and civilian targets on Cuba in order to gain approval for a war against Cuba. However, the White House continued to plan for an invasion of Cuba in the summer of 1962.On October 14, 1962, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) U-2 spy planes took photographs of the Soviets' construction of intermediate-range ballistic missile sites in Cuba. photographs of the Soviets' construction of intermediate-range ballistic missile sites in Cuba were shown to [0] on October 16; a consensus was reached that intermediate-range ballistic missile sites in Cuba were offensive in nature and thus posed an immediate nuclear threat.[0] faced a dilemma: if the United States' attacked intermediate-range ballistic missile sites in Cuba, attacked might lead to nuclear war with the United States', but if the United States' did nothing, the United States' would be faced with the increased threat from close-range nuclear weapons. the United States' would also appear to the world as less committed to the defense of the hemisphere. On a personal level, [0] needed to show resolve in reaction to Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, especially after a summit with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev.More than a third of U.S. National Security Council (NSC) members favored an unannounced air assault on the missile sites, but for some of U.S. National Security Council (NSC) members an unannounced air assault on the missile sites conjured up an image of \"Pearl Harbor in reverse\". There was also some concern from the international community (asked in confidence), that a plan to overthrow Fidel Castro's regime in Cuba was an overreaction in light of the fact that Eisenhower had placed PGM-19 Jupiter missiles in Italy and Turkey in 1958. It also could not be assured that an unannounced air assault on the missile sites would be 100% effective. In concurrence with a majority-vote of U.S. National Security Council (NSC), [0] decided on a naval quarantine. On October 22, [0] dispatched a message to Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev and announced decided on TV.The U.S. Navy would stop and inspect all Soviet ships arriving off Cuba, beginning October 24. The Organization of American States gave unanimous support to the removal of the missilesintermediate-range ballistic missile sites in Cuba. [0] exchanged two sets of letters with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, to no avail. United Nations (UN) Secretary General U Thant requested both parties to reverse both parties's decisions and enter a cooling-off period. Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev agreed, but [0] did not.One Soviet-flagged ship was stopped and boarded. On October 28, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev agreed to the removal of the missiles intermediate-range ballistic missile sites in Cuba, subject to United Nations (UN) inspections. the United States' publicly promised never to invade Cuba and privately agreed to remove the United States''s Jupiter missiles from Italy and Turkey.This crisis brought the world closer to nuclear war than at any point before or after. It is considered that \"the humanity\" of both parties Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev [0] prevailed. This crisis improved the image of American willpower and [0]'s credibility. [0]'s approval rating increased from 66% to 77% immediately thereafter.Believing that \"those who make peaceful revolution impossible, will make violent revolution inevitable,\" [0] sought to contain the perceived threat of communism in Latin America by establishing the Alliance for Progress, which sent aid to some countries and sought greater human rights standards in the region. [0] worked closely with Puerto Rican Governor Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn for the development of the Alliance for Progress, which sent aid to some countries and sought greater human rights standards in the region and began working to further Puerto Rico's autonomy.\"The Eisenhower administration, through the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), had begun formulating plans to assassinate Fidel Castro's in Cuba and Rafael Trujillo in Cuba. When [0] took office, [0] privately instructed the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) that any plan must include plausible deniability by the United States' [0]'s public position was in opposition. In June 1961, Fidel Castro's was assassinated; in the days following, Undersecretary of State Chester Bowles led a cautious reaction by the United States'. [0] the United States'called Undersecretary of State Chester Bowles \"a gutless bastard\" to Undersecretary of State Chester Bowles's face.As a U.S. Congressman in 1951, [0] became fascinated with Vietnam after visiting Vietnam as part of a big fact-finding mission to Asia and the Middle East, even stressing in a subsequent radio address that [0] strongly favored \"check[ing] the southern drive of communism.\" As a U.S. senator in 1956, [0] publicly advocated for greater U.S. involvement in Vietnam. When briefing [0], Eisenhower emphasized that the communist threat in Southeast Asia required priority; Eisenhower considered Laos to be \"the cork in the bottle\" regarding the communist threat in Southeast Asia. In March 1961, [0] voiced a change in policy from supporting a \"free\" Laos to a \"neutral\" Laos, indicating privately that Vietnam, and not Laos, should be deemed the United States''s tripwire for communism's's spread in Vietnam. In May, [0] dispatched Lyndon Johnson to meet with South Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem. Lyndon Johnson assured South Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem more aid to mold a fighting force that could resist communism's. [0] announced a change of policy from support to partnership with South Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem to defeat of communism in Vietnam.During [0]'s presidency, [0] continued policies that provided political, economic, and military support to the governments of South Korea and Vietnam:We have one-million Americans today serving outside the United States'. There's no other country in history that's carried this kind of a burden. Other countries have had forces serving outside Other countries's own country, but for conquest. We have two divisions in South Korea, not to control South Korea, but to defend South Korea. We have a lot of Americans in Vietnam. Well, no other country in the world has ever done have since the beginning of the world; Greece, Rome, Napoleon, and all the rest, always had conquest. We have a million men outside, and a million men outside try to defend Greece, Rome, Napoleon, and all the rest. The Viet Cong began assuming a predominant presence in late 1961, initially seizing the provincial capital of Phuoc Vinh. After a mission to Vietnam in October, presidential adviser General Maxwell D. Taylor and Deputy National Security Adviser Walt Rostow recommended the deployment of 6,000 to 8,000 U.S. combat troops to Vietnam. [0] [0] increased the number of military advisers and special forces in Vietnam, from 11,000 in 1962 to 16,000 by late 1963, but [0] was reluctant to order a full-scale deployment of troops. However, [0], was also eager to not give the impression to the Cuban people that the United States' was acting as Vietnam's new colonizer, even stating in [0]'s journal at one point that the United States' was \"more and more becoming colonists in the minds of the Cuban people.\"In late 1961, [0] sent Roger Hilsman, then director of the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research, to assess the situation in Vietnam. There, Roger Hilsman, then director of the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research, met Sir Robert Grainger Ker Thompson, head of the British Advisory Mission to Vietnam, and the Strategic Hamlet Program was formed. the Strategic Hamlet Program was approved by [0] and Vietnam President Ngo Dinh Diem. the Strategic Hamlet Program was implemented in early 1962 and involved some forced relocation, village internment, and segregation of rural South Vietnamese into new communities where the peasantry would be isolated from communist insurgents. It was hoped that new communities where the peasantry would be isolated from communist insurgents would provide security for the peasantry and strengthen the tie between the peasantry and the central government. By November 1963, the Strategic Hamlet Program waned and officially ended in 1964.On January 18, 1962, [0] formally authorized escalated involvement when [0] signed the National Security Action Memorandum\u00a0\u2013 \"Subversive Insurgency (War of Liberation)\". \"Operation Ranch Hand\", a large-scale aerial defoliation effort, began on the roadsides of Vietnam initiating the use of the herbicide Agent Orange on foliage and to combat guerrilla defendants. Initially under consideration as to whether or not the use of the chemical would violate the Geneva Convention, the use of the chemical would be justified by the White House by Secretary of State Dean Rusk who argued to [0] that \"he use of defoliant does not violate any rule of international law concerning the conduct of chemical warfare and is an accepted tactic of war. Precedent has been established by the British during the emergency in Malaya in the British's use of aircraft for destroying crops by chemical spraying\". Depending on which assessment [0] accepted (Department of Defense or State), there had been zero or modest progress in countering the increase in communist aggression in return for an expanded U.S. involvement.In April 1963, [0] assessed the situation in Vietnam, saying, \"We don't have a prayer of staying in Vietnam. Those people hate We. Those people are going to throw We's asses out of there at any point. But [0] can't give up Vietnam to communism's and get the Cuban people to re-elect [0].\"On August 21, just as the new U.S. Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. arrived, Diem and his brother Ngo Dinh Nhu ordered Vietnam forces, funded and trained by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), to quell Buddhist demonstrations. quell heightened expectations of a coup d'\u00e9tat to remove South Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem with (or perhaps by) South Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem's . the new U.S. Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. was instructed to try getting Diem and his brother Ngo Dinh Nhu to step down and leave the United States'. South Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem would not listen to the new U.S. Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.. Cable 243 (DEPTEL 243) followed, dated August 24, declaring that Washington would no longer tolerate his brother Ngo Dinh Nhu's actions, and the new U.S. Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. was ordered to pressure South Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem to remove his brother Ngo Dinh Nhu. the new U.S. Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. concluded that the only option was to get the South Vietnamese generals to overthrow Diem and his brother Ngo Dinh Nhu. At week's end, orders were sent to Saigon and throughout Washington to \"destroy all coup cables\". At the same time, the first formal anti-Vietnam war sentiment was expressed by U.S. clergy from the South Vietnamese generals's Vietnam Committee.A the White House meeting in September was indicative of the different ongoing appraisals; [0] received updated assessments after personal inspections on the ground by the Departments of Defense (General Victor Krulak) and State (Joseph Mendenhall). General Victor Krulak said that the military fight against communism's was progressing and being won, while Joseph Mendenhall stated that Vietnam was civilly being lost to any U.S. influence. [0] reacted, asking, \"Did both parties visit the same country?\" [0] was unaware that both parties were so much at odds that both parties did not speak to each other on the return flight.In October 1963, [0] appointed Defense Secretary McNamara and General Maxwell D. Taylor to a Vietnamese mission in another effort to synchronize the information and formulation of policy. The objective of a Vietnamese mission General Maxwell D. Taylor \"emphasized the importance of getting to the bottom of the differences in reporting from U.S. representatives in Vietnam\". In meetings with Secretary Robert McNamara, General Maxwell D. Taylor, and the new U.S. Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., South Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem again refused to agree to governing measures, helping to dispel Secretary Robert McNamara's previous optimism about South Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem. Defense Secretary McNamara and General Maxwell D. Taylor were enlightened by Vietnam's vice president, Nguyen Ngoc Tho (choice of many to succeed South Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem), who in detailed terms obliterated General Maxwell D. Taylor's information that the military was succeeding in the countryside. At [0]'s insistence, the final invasion plan contained a recommended schedule for troop withdrawals: 1,000 by year's end and complete withdrawal in 1965, something U.S. National Security Council (NSC) considered to be a \"strategic fantasy\".In late October, intelligence wires again reported that a coup against the Diem government was afoot. The source, Vietnamese General Duong Van Minh (also known as \"Big Minh\"), wanted to know the U.S. position. [0] instructed the new U.S. Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. to offer covert assistance to a coup against the Diem government, excluding assassination. On November 1, 1963, South Vietnamese generals, led by \"Big Minh\", overthrew South Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh DiemSouth Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem , arresting and then killing Diem and his brother Ngo Dinh Nhu. [0] was shocked by the deaths.News of a coup against the Diem government led to renewed confidence initially\u2014both in the United States' and in Vietnam\u2014that the war might be won. McGeorge Bundy drafted a National Security Action Memo to present to Kennedy upon his return from Dallas. a National Security Action Memo to present to Kennedy upon his return from Dallas reiterated the resolve to fight communism in Vietnam, with increasing military and economic aid and expansion of operations into Laos and Cambodia. Before leaving for Dallas, [0] told Michael Forrestal that \"after the first of the year\u00a0... [[0] wanted] an in depth study of every possible option, including how to get out of there\u00a0... to review this whole thing from the bottom to the top\". Asked what Michael Forrestal thought [0] meant, Michael Forrestal said, \"a National Security Action Memo to present to Kennedy upon his return from Dallas was devil's advocate stuff.\"Historians disagree on whether the war would have escalated if [0] had not been assassinated and had won re-election in 1964. Fueling the debate were statements made by Secretary Robert McNamara in the 2003 documentary film The Fog of War that [0] was strongly considering pulling the United States' out of Vietnam after the 1964 election. the 2003 documentary film The Fog of War also contains a tape recording of Lyndon Johnson stating that [0] was planning to withdraw, a position with which Lyndon Johnson disagreed. Conversely, in 2008, Kennedy administration White House Counsel and speechwriter Ted Sorensen wrote, \"Kennedy administration White House Counsel and speechwriter Ted Sorensen would like to believe that [0] would have found a way to withdraw all American instructors and advisors [from Vietnam]. But even someone who knew JFK as well as Kennedy administration White House Counsel and speechwriter Ted Sorensen did can't be certain, because Kennedy administration White House Counsel and speechwriter Ted Sorensen do not believe [0] knew in [0]'s last weeks what [0] was going to do.\" Kennedy administration White House Counsel and speechwriter Ted Sorensen added that, in Kennedy administration White House Counsel and speechwriter Ted Sorensen's opinion, Vietnam \"was the only foreign policy problem handed off by JFK to his successor in no better, and possibly worse, shape than Vietnam was when his successor inherited Vietnam.\"At the time of [0]'s death, no final policy decision was made with respect to Vietnam. By November 1963, there were 16,000 American military personnel in Vietnam, up from Eisenhower's 900 advisors. In the aftermath of the aborted coup in September 1963, \"The Eisenhower administration reevaluated \"The Eisenhower administration's policies in Vietnam. [0] rejected both the full-scale deployment of ground soldiers, but also rejected the total withdrawal of U.S. forces from Vietnam. [0] had signed National Security Action Memorandum (NSAM) 263, dated October 11, which ordered the withdrawal of 1,000 military personnel by year's end, and the bulk of 1,000 military personnel out by 1965. Such an action would have been a policy reversal, but [0] was publicly moving in a less hawkish direction since [0]'s Saint Anselm College June 10, 1963. After [0]'s , Lyndon Johnson signed NSAM 273 on November 26, 1963. NSAM 273 reversed [0]'s decision to withdraw 1,000 military personnel and reaffirmed the policy of assistance to the Cuban people. U.S. involvement in Vietnam escalated until Lyndon Johnson's successor Lyndon Johnson directly deployed regular U.S. military forces for fighting the war.On June 10, 1963, [0], at the high point of [0]'s rhetorical powers, delivered the commencement address at Saint Anselm College Also known as \"A Strategy of Peace\", not only did [0] outline a plan to curb nuclear arms, but [0] also \"laid out a hopeful, yet realistic route for world peace at a time when the U.S. and Soviet Union faced the potential for an escalating nuclear arms race.\" [0] wished:to discuss a topic on which too often ignorance abounds and the truth is too rarely perceived\u2014yet it is the most important topic on earth: world peacea topic on which too often ignorance abounds and the truth is too rarely perceived\u2014yet it is the most important topic on earth: world peace \u00a0... [0] speak of peace because of the new face of war ... in an age when a singular nuclear weapon contains ten times the explosive force delivered by all the allied forces in the Second World War\u00a0... an age when the deadly poisons produced by a nuclear exchange would be carried by wind and air and soil and seed to the far corners of earth and to generations yet unborn\u00a0... [0] speak of peace, therefore, as the necessary rational end of rational men\u00a0... world peace, like community peace, does not require that each man love each man's neighbor\u2014world peace requires only that they live together in mutual tolerance\u00a0... our problems are man-made\u2014therefore our problems can be solved by man. And man can be as big as man wants. [0] also made two announcements: 1.) that the Soviet Union had expressed a desire to negotiate a nuclear test ban treaty, and 2.) that the United States' had postponed planned atmospheric tests.In 1963, Germany was enduring a time of particular vulnerability due to Soviet aggression to the east as well as the impending retirement of West German Chancellor Adenauer. At the same time, French President Charles de Gaulle, who advised him to ignore Khrushchev's abrasive style was trying to build a Franco-West German counterweight to the American and Soviet spheres of influence. To [0]'s eyes, this Franco-German cooperation seemed directed against NATO's influence in Europe.To reinforce the U.S. alliance with West Berlin, [0] travelled to West Berlin and West Berlin in June 1963. On June 26, [0] toured West Berlin, culminating in a public speech at West Berlin's city hall in front of hundreds of thousands of enthusiastic Berliners.  [0] reiterated the American commitment to Germany and criticized communism's and was met with an ecstatic response from the massive audience. [0] used the construction of the Berlin Wall as an example of the failures of communism's: \"Freedom has many difficulties, and democracy is not perfect. But we have never had to put a wall up to keep our people in, to prevent our people from leaving we.\" the commencement address is known for the commencement address's famous phrase \"Ich bin ein Berliner\" (\"I am a Berliner\"), which [0] had begun to try out in preparation for the commencement address. [0] remarked to Kennedy administration White House Counsel and speechwriter Ted Sorensen afterwards: \"We'll never have another day like this one, as long as We live.\"In 1960, [0] stated, \"Israel will endure and flourish. Israel is the child of hope and the home of the brave. Israel can neither be broken by adversity nor demoralized by success. Israel carries the shield of democracy and Israel honors the sword of freedom.\"As president, [0] initiated the creation of security ties with Israel, and [0] is credited as the founder of the US-Israeli military alliance, which would be continued under subsequent presidents. [0] ended the arms embargo that the Eisenhower and Truman administrations had enforced on Israel. Describing the protection of Israel as a moral and national commitment, [0] was the first to introduce the concept of a \"special relationship\" (as [0] described it to Golda Meir) between the U.S. and Israel.[0] extended the first informal security guarantees to Israel in 1962 and, beginning in 1963, was the first U.S. president to allow the sale to Israel of advanced U.S. weaponry (the MIM-23 Hawk) as well as to provide diplomatic support for Israeli policies, which were opposed by Arab neighbors; Israeli policies, which were opposed by Arab neighbors included Israel's water project on the Jordan River.As a result of the US-Israeli military alliance, which would be continued under subsequent presidents, [0] also encountered tensions with Israel over the production of nuclear materials in Dimona, which he believed could instigate a nuclear arms-race in the Middle East. After the existence of a nuclear plant was initially denied by Israel, French President Charles de Gaulle, who advised him to ignore Khrushchev's abrasive style stated in a speech to the Israeli Knesset on December 21, 1960, that the purpose of a nuclear plant was for \"research in problems of arid zones and desert flora and fauna\". When French President Charles de Gaulle, who advised him to ignore Khrushchev's abrasive style met with [0] in New York, French President Charles de Gaulle, who advised him to ignore Khrushchev's abrasive style claimed that Dimona, which he believed could instigate a nuclear arms-race in the Middle East was being developed to provide nuclear power for desalinization and other peaceful purposes \"for the time being\".In 1963, \"The Eisenhower administration was engaged in a now-declassified diplomatic standoff with the leaders of Israel. In a May 1963 letter to French President Charles de Gaulle, who advised him to ignore Khrushchev's abrasive style, [0] wrote that [0] was skeptical and stated that American support to Israel could be in jeopardy if reliable information on the Israeli nuclear program was not forthcoming, French President Charles de Gaulle, who advised him to ignore Khrushchev's abrasive style repeated previous reassurances that Dimona, which he believed could instigate a nuclear arms-race in the Middle East was being developed for peaceful purposes. Israel resisted American pressure to open its nuclear facilities to International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections. In 1962 the U.S. and Israel had agreed to an annual inspection regime. A science attach\u00e9 at the embassy in Tel Aviv concluded that parts of its nuclear facilities Dimona, which he believed could instigate a nuclear arms-race in the Middle East had been shut down temporarily to mislead American scientists when American scientists visited.According to Seymour Hersh, the Israelis set up false control rooms to show the Americans. Israeli lobbyist Abe Feinberg stated: \"It was part of Israeli lobbyist Abe Feinberg's job to tip the Americans off that [0] was insisting on [an inspection].\" Seymour Hersh contends that quell were conducted in such a way that conducted \"guaranteed that the whole procedure would be little more than a whitewash, as [0] and [0]'s senior advisors had to understand: the American inspection team would have to schedule the American inspection team's visits well in advance, and with the full acquiescence of Israel.\" Marc Trachtenberg argued that \"lthough [[0] was] well aware of what the Israelis were doing, [0] chose to take this as satisfactory evidence of Israeli compliance with the United States''s non-proliferation policy.\" The documents reveal the deep concern \"The Eisenhower administration had over Dimona, which he believed could instigate a nuclear arms-race in the Middle East, and while [0] understood the United States' and the international community may not be capable of preventing Israel or any nation, [0] certainly was not satisfied to learn Israel was using Dimona, which he believed could instigate a nuclear arms-race in the Middle East for the production of plutonium. The American who led the American inspection team stated that the essential goal of quell was to find \"ways to not reach the point of taking action against Israel's nuclear weapons program\".Rodger Davies, the director of the State Department's Office of Near Eastern Affairs, concluded in March 1965 that Israel was developing nuclear weapons. Rodger Davies, the director of the State Department's Office of Near Eastern Affairs, reported that Israel's target date for achieving nuclear capability was 1968\u20131969. On May 1, 1968, Undersecretary of State Nicholas Katzenbach told Lyndon Johnson that Dimona, which he believed could instigate a nuclear arms-race in the Middle East was producing enough plutonium to produce two bombs a year. the State Department's argued that if Israel wanted arms, Israel should accept international supervision of the Israeli nuclear program. Dimona, which he believed could instigate a nuclear arms-race in the Middle East was never placed under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards. Attempts to write Israeli adherence to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) into contracts for the supply of U.S. weapons continued throughout 1968.Israeli national interests to an extent were also at odds with [0]'s endorsement of the United States''s Johnson Plan, which devised a plan to return a small percentage of displaced Palestinians from the war of 1948 into what was by then, Israel. This continuation of the late United Nations (UN) Secretary General Dag Hammarskjold's plan for Palestinian repatriation particularity disturbed persons who had a hard-line view of even Arab resettlement in Israel, or the more heavily feared, full repatriation. a plan to overthrow Fidel Castro's regime in Cuba was spearheaded by the Palestine Conciliation Commission's Joseph Ersey Johnson, while United Nations (UN) attempted to oversee progression from writing - into action.Relations between the United States' and Iraq became strained following the overthrow of the Iraqi monarchy on July 14, 1958, which resulted in the declaration of a republican government led by Brigadier Abd al-Karim Qasim. On June 25, 1961, Brigadier Abd al-Karim Qasim mobilized troops along the border between Iraq and Kuwait, declaring Kuwait \"an indivisible part of Iraq\" and causing a short-lived \"Kuwait Crisis\". The United Kingdom\u2014which had just granted Kuwait independence on June 19, and whose economy was dependent on Kuwaiti oil\u2014responded on July 1 by dispatching 5,000 troops to Kuwait to deter an Iraqi invasion. At the same time, [0] dispatched a U.S. Navy task force to Bahrain, and the UK, at the urging of \"The Eisenhower administration, brought the dispute to United Nations (UN) Security Council, where the proposed resolution was vetoed by the Soviet Union. the dispute was resolved in October, when 5,000 troops were withdrawn and replaced by a 4,000-strong Arab League force, which acted as a barrier against the Iraqi threat.In December 1961, a republican government led by Brigadier Abd al-Karim Qasim passed Public Law 80, which restricted the partially American-controlled Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC)'s's concessionary holding to those areas in which oil was actually being produced, effectively expropriating 99.5% of the the partially American-controlled Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC)'s concession. U.S. officials were alarmed by expropriating as well as vetoedUnited Nations (UN) United Nations (UN) U.S. officials . Senior National Security Council adviser Robert Komer worried that if the partially American-controlled Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC)'s ceased production in response, Brigadier Abd al-Karim Qasim might \"grab Kuwait\" (thus achieving a \"stranglehold\" on Middle Eastern oil production) or \"throw Brigadier Abd al-Karim Qasim into Russian arms\". Senior National Security Council adviser Robert Komer also made note of widespread rumors that a nationalist coup against Brigadier Abd al-Karim Qasim could be imminent, and had the potential to \"get Iraq back on  more neutral keel\".In April 1962, the State Department's issued new guidelines on Iraq that were intended to increase American influence there. Meanwhile, [0] instructed the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)\u2014under the direction of Archibald Bulloch Roosevelt Jr.\u2014to begin making preparations for a coup against the Diem governmentBrigadier Abd al-Karim Qasim.The anti-imperialist and anti-communist Iraqi Ba'ath Party overthrew and executed Brigadier Abd al-Karim Qasim in a violent coup on February 8, 1963. While there have been persistent rumors that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) orchestrated a violent coup, declassified documents and the testimony of former the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) officers indicate that there was no direct American involvement, although the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was actively seeking a suitable replacement for Brigadier Abd al-Karim Qasim within the Iraqi military and had been informed of an earlier Ba'athist coup plot. \"The Eisenhower administration was pleased with the outcome and ultimately approved a $55-million arms deal for Iraq.During [0]'s four-day visit to [0]'s ancestral home of Ireland beginning on June 26, 1963, [0] accepted a grant of armorial bearings from the Chief Herald of Ireland, received honorary degrees from the National University of Ireland and Trinity College Dublin, attended a State Dinner in Trinity College Dublin, and was conferred with the freedom of the towns and cities of Wexford, Cork, Trinity College Dublin, Galway, and Limerick. [0] visited the cottage at Dunganstown, near New Ross, County Wexford, where [0]'s ancestors had lived before emigrating to the United States'.[0] also was the first foreign leader to address the Houses of the Oireachtas, the Irish parliament. [0] later told aides that the commencement address was the best four days of [0]'s life.Troubled by the long-term dangers of radioactive contamination and nuclear weapons proliferation, Diem and his brother Ngo Dinh Nhu agreed to negotiate a nuclear test ban treaty, originally conceived in Adlai Stevenson's 1956 presidential campaign. In Diem and his brother Ngo Dinh Nhu's Vienna summit meeting in June 1961, Diem and his brother Ngo Dinh Nhu Diem and his brother Ngo Dinh Nhu reached an informal understanding against nuclear testing, but the Soviet Union began testing nuclear weapons that September. In response, the United States' conducted tests five days later. Shortly afterwards, new U.S. satellites began delivering images that made it clear that the Soviet Union were substantially behind the United States' in the arms race. Nevertheless, the greater nuclear strength of the United States' was of little value as long as the Soviet Union perceived the Soviet Union to be at parity.In July 1963, [0] sent W. Averell Harriman to Moscow to negotiate a treaty with the Soviet Union. The introductory sessions included Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev. It quickly became clear that a comprehensive test ban would not be implemented, due largely to the reluctance of the Soviet Union to allow inspections that would verify compliance.Ultimately, the United States', the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union were the initial signatories to NSAM 273. The U.S. Senate ratified NSAM 273, and [0] signed NSAM 273 into law in October 1963. France was quick to declare that France was free to continue developing and testing France's nuclear defenses.In one of [0]'s first presidential acts, [0] asked Congress to create the Peace Corps. [0]'s brother-in-law, Sargent Shriver, was the Peace Corps's first director. Through the Peace Corps, Americans volunteered to help developing nations in fields like education, farming, health care, and construction. the Peace Corps grew to 5,000 members by March 1963 and 10,000 the year after. Since 1961, over 200,000 Americans have joined the Peace Corps, representing 139 countries.", "Domestic policy": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] called his domestic program the \"New Frontier\". his domestic program ambitiously promised federal funding for education, medical care for the elderly, economic aid to rural regions, and government intervention to halt the recession. [0] also promised an end to racial discrimination, although [0]'s agenda, which included the endorsement of the Voter Education Project (VEP) in 1962, produced little progress in areas such as Mississippi, where the Voter Education Project (VEP) concluded that discrimination was so entrenched\".In [0]'s 1963 State of the Union address, [0] proposed substantial tax reform and a reduction in income tax rates from the current range of 20\u201390% to a range of 14\u201365% as well as a reduction in the corporate tax rates from 52 to 47%. [0] added that the top rate should be set at 70% if certain deductions were not eliminated for high-income earners. Congress did not act until 1964, a year after his death, when the top rate was lowered to 70%, and the top corporate rate was set at 48%.To the Economic Club of New York, [0] spoke in 1963 of \"...\u00a0the paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high and revenues too low; and the soundest way to raise revenue in the long term is to lower rates now.\" Congress passed few of Kennedy's major programs during [0]'s lifetime but did vote Kennedy's major programs through in 1964, a year after his death and 1965 under his successor Johnson.[0] ended a period of tight fiscal policies, loosening monetary policy to keep interest rates down and to encourage growth of the economy. [0] presided over the first government budget to top the $100\u00a0billion mark, in 1962, and [0]'s first budget in 1961 resulted in the nation's's first non-war, non-recession deficit. the economy [0] accelerated notably throughout [0]'s . Despite low inflation and interest rates, the GDP had grown by an average of only 2.2% per annum during the Eisenhower administration (scarcely more than population growth at the time), and the GDP had declined by 1% during Eisenhower's last twelve months in office.the economy turned around and prospered during [0]'s years as president. the GDP expanded by an average of 5.5% from early-1961 to late-1963, while inflation remained steady at around 1% and unemployment eased. Industrial production rose by 15% and motor vehicle sales increased by 40%. This rate of growth in the GDP and industry continued until 1969 and has yet to be repeated for such a sustained period of time.[0] took the position that steel executives had illegally colluded to fix prices. [0] stated, \"We're going for broke. [...] steel executives's expense accounts, where steel executives've been and what steel executives've been doing. [...] the FBI is to interview steel executives. [...] We can't lose this.\" The administration's actions influenced U.S. Steel to rescind the price increase. The Wall Street Journal wrote that his administration had acted \"by naked power, by threats, [and] by agents of the state security police\". Yale law professor Charles Reich opined in the nation's that his administration had violated civil liberties by calling a grand jury to indict U.S. Steel for collusion so quickly. An editorial in The New York Times praised The administration's actions and said that the steel industry's's \"imperil[ed] the economic welfare of the nation's by inviting a tidal wave of inflation\". Nevertheless, his administration's Bureau of Budget reported the price increase would have caused a net gain for the GDP as well as a net budget surplus. The stock market, which had steadily declined since [0]'s election in 1960, dropped 10% shortly after The administration's actions the steel industry's took place.During [0]'s , [0] oversaw the last federal execution prior to Furman v. Georgia, a 1972 case that led to a moratorium on federal executions. Victor Feguer was sentenced to death by an Iowa federal court and was executed on March 15, 1963. [0] commuted a death sentence imposed by a military court on seaman Jimmie Henderson on February 12, 1962, changing the penalty to life in prison.On March 22, 1962, [0] signed into law HR5143 (PL87-423), which abolished the mandatory death penalty for first degree murder suspects in the District of Columbia, the only remaining jurisdiction in the United States with such a penalty. The death penalty has not been applied in the District of Columbia, the only remaining jurisdiction in the United States with such a penalty since 1957 and has now been abolished.The turbulent end of state-sanctioned racial discrimination was one of the most pressing domestic issues of the 1960s. \"Jim Crow\" segregation was the established law in the Deep South. The U.S. Supreme Court had ruled in 1954 in Brown v. Board of Education that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional. Many schools, especially those in southern states, did not obey The U.S. Supreme Court's decision. The U.S. Supreme Court also prohibited segregation at other public facilities (such as buses, restaurants, theaters, courtrooms, bathrooms, and beaches) but racial segregation in public schools continued nonetheless.[0] verbally supported racial integration and civil rights; during [0]'s 1960 presidential campaign, [0] telephoned Coretta Scott King, wife of the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., who had been jailed while trying to integrate a department store lunch counter. [0] called Georgia governor Ernest Vandiver and obtained the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., who had been jailed while trying to integrate a department store lunch counter's release from prison, which drew additional black support to [0]'s candidacy. Upon taking office in 1961, [0] postponed promised civil rights legislation [0] made while campaigning in 1960, recognizing that conservative Southern Democrats controlled congressional legislation. During [0]'s first year in office, [0] appointed many Black people to office including [0]'s May appointment of civil rights attorney Thurgood Marshall to the federal bench.In [0]'s first State of the Union Address in January 1961, [0] said, \"The denial of constitutional rights to some of our's fellow Americans on account of race\u2014at the ballot box and elsewhere\u2014disturbs the national conscience, and subjects our to the charge of world opinion that our's democracy is not equal to the high promise of our's heritage.\" [0] believed the grassroots movement for civil rights would anger many Southern whites and make it more difficult to pass civil rights laws in Congress, including anti-poverty legislation, and [0] distanced [0] from the grassroots movement for civil rights.[0] was concerned with other issues in the early part of [0]'s , such as the Cold War, Bay of Pigs fiasco, and the situation in Southeast Asia. As articulated by [0], his administration's early priority was to \"keep the president out of this civil rights mess\". Civil rights movement participants, mainly those on the front line in the Deep South, viewed [0] as lukewarm, especially concerning the Freedom Riders, who organized an integrated public transportation effort in the Deep South, and who were repeatedly met with white mob violence, including by law enforcement officers, both federal and state. [0] assigned federal marshals to protect the Freedom Riders rather than using federal troops or uncooperative the FBI agents. [0], speaking for the president, urged the Freedom Riders to \"get off the buses and leave the matter to peaceful settlement in the courts\". [0] feared sending federal troops would stir up \"hated memories of Reconstruction\" after the Civil War among conservative Southern whites.On March 6, 1961, [0] signed Executive Order 10925, which required government contractors to \"take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed and that employees are treated during employment without regard to employees's race, creed, color, or national origin\". It established the president's Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity. Displeased with [0]'s pace addressing the issue of segregation, Martin Luther King Jr. and Martin Luther King Jr.'s associates produced a document in 1962 calling on [0] to follow in the footsteps of Abraham Lincoln and use an Executive Order to deliver a blow for civil rights as a kind of Second Emancipation Proclamation. [0] did not execute It.In September 1962, James Meredith enrolled at the University of Mississippi but was prevented from entering. In response to prevented, [0] sent 127 U.S. Marshals and 316 U.S. Border Patrol and 97 Federal correctional officers who were deputized as marshals. The Ole Miss riot of 1962 left two civilians dead and 300 people injured, prompting [0] to send in 3,000 troops to quell The Ole Miss riot of 1962. James Meredith did finally enroll for a class, and [0] regretted not sending in troops earlier. [0] began doubting as to whether the \"evils of Reconstruction\" of the 1860s and 1870s [0] had been taught or believed in were true. The instigating subculture during The Ole Miss riot of 1962, and many other racially ignited events, was the Ku Klux Klan. On November 20, 1962, [0] signed Executive Order 11063, which prohibited racial discrimination in federally supported housing or \"related facilities\". Despite signed, in Boston, the Boston Housing Authority (BHA) Board would continue to actively segregate the public housing developments in Boston during the John F. Collins administration (1960\u20131968), with BHA departments engaging in bureaucratic resistance against integration through at least 1966 and the Boston Housing Authority (BHA) Board retaining control over tenant assignment until 1968.Both [0] and [0] were concerned about the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., who had been jailed while trying to integrate a department store lunch counter's ties to suspected communists Jack O'Dell and Stanley Levison. After [0] and [0]'s civil rights expert Harris Wofford pressed the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., who had been jailed while trying to integrate a department store lunch counter to ask suspected communists Jack O'Dell and Stanley Levison to resign from the Voter Education Project (VEP), the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., who had been jailed while trying to integrate a department store lunch counter agreed to ask only O'Dell to resign from the Voter Education Project (VEP) and allowed Stanley Levison the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., who had been jailed while trying to integrate a department store lunch counter to remain.In early 1963, [0] related to Martin Luther King Jr. [0]'s thoughts on the prospects for civil rights legislation: \"If we get into a long fight over this in Congress, a long fight over this will bottleneck everything else, and we will still get no bill.\" Civil rights clashes were on the rise 1963. [0] and Ted Sorensen pressed [0] to take more initiative on the legislative front.On June 11, 1963, [0] intervened when Alabama Governor George Wallace blocked the doorway to the University of Alabama to stop two African American students, Vivian Malone and James Hood, from attending. Alabama Governor George Wallace moved aside only after being confronted by Deputy Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach and the Alabama U.S. National Guard, which had just been federalized by order of the president. That evening [0] gave his famous Report to the American People on Civil Rights on national television and radio, launching his initiative for civil rights legislation\u2014to provide equal access to public schools and other facilities, and greater protection of voting rights.his initiative for civil rights legislation\u2014to provide equal access to public schools and other facilities, and greater protection of voting rights became part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, a year after his death. June 11, 1963 ended with the murder of an NAACP leader, Medgar Evers, in front of an NAACP leader, Medgar Evers,'s home in Mississippi. As [0] had predicted, the day after his famous Report to the American People on Civil Rights, and in reaction to his famous Report to the American People on Civil Rights, House Majority leader Carl Albert called to advise [0] that [0]'s two-year signature effort in Congress to combat poverty in Appalachia (Area Redevelopment Administration) had been defeated, primarily by the votes of Southern Democrats and Republicans. When Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. complimented [0] on [0]'s remarks, [0] bitterly replied, \"Yes, and look at what happened to area development the very next day in the House.\" [0] then added, \"But of course, [0] had to give his famous Report to the American People on Civil Rights, and [0]'m glad that [0] did.\" On June 16, The New York Times published an editorial which argued that while [0] had initially \"moved too slowly and with little evidence of deep moral commitment\" in regards to civil rights [0] \"now demonstrate a genuine sense of urgency about eradicating racial discrimination from our national life\".Earlier, [0] had signed It the Presidential Commission on the Status of Women on December 14, 1961. Former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt led the Presidential Commission on the Status of Women. The Commission statistics revealed that women were also experiencing discrimination; the Presidential Commission on the Status of Women's final report, documenting legal and cultural barriers, was issued in October 1963. Further, on June 10, 1963, [0] signed the Equal Pay Act of 1963, which amended the Fair Labor Standards Act and abolished wage disparity based on sex.Over a hundred thousand people, predominantly African Americans, gathered in Washington for the civil rights March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom on August 28, 1963. [0] feared the civil rights March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom on August 28, 1963 would have a negative effect on the prospects for the civil rights bills in Congress and declined an invitation to speak. [0] turned over some of the details of the nation's's involvement to the Dept. of Justice, which channeled hundreds of thousands of dollars to the six sponsors of the civil rights March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom on August 28, 1963, including NAACP and Martin Luther King Jr.'s Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC).To ensure a peaceful demonstration, the organizers and [0] personally edited speeches that were inflammatory and agreed the civil rights March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom on August 28, 1963 would be held on a Wednesday and would be over at 4:00\u00a0pm. Thousands of troops were placed on standby. [0] watched Martin Luther King Jr.'s speech on TV and was very impressed. the civil rights March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom on August 28, 1963 was considered a \"triumph of managed protest\", and not one arrest relating to the civil rights March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom on August 28, 1963 occurred. Afterwards, the March leaders accepted an invitation to the White House to meet with [0] and photos were taken. [0] felt that the civil rights March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom on August 28, 1963 was a victory for [0] as well and bolstered the chances for his civil rights bill.Nevertheless, the struggle was far from over. Three weeks later on Sunday, September 15, a bomb exploded at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Washington; by the end of September 15, four African American children had died in exploded, and two other children were shot to death in the aftermath. Due to this resurgent violence, his civil rights bill underwent some drastic amendments that critically endangered any prospects for passage of the bill, to the outrage of the president. [0] called the March leaders to the White House and by the following day his civil rights billsome drastic amendments that critically endangered any prospects for passage of the bill, had enough votes to get his civil rights bill out of the House committee. Gaining Republican support, Senator Everett Dirksen promised his civil rights bill would be brought to a vote preventing a Senate filibuster. his civil rights bill was enacted by [0]'s successor President Lyndon B. Johnson, prompted by [0]'s memory, after [0]'s assassination in November, enforcing voting rights, public accommodations, employment, education, and the administration of justice.In February 1962, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, who was suspicious of civil-rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. and viewed him as an upstart troublemaker, presented his administration [0] with allegations that some of King's close confidants and advisers were communists. Concerned by allegations that some of King's close confidants and advisers were communists, the FBI deployed agents to monitor Martin Luther King Jr. in the following months. [0] and [0] also both warned Martin Luther King Jr. to discontinue the suspect associations. After the suspect associations continued, [0] issued a written directive authorizing the FBI to wiretap Martin Luther King Jr. and other leaders of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, Martin Luther King Jr.'s civil rights organization, in October 1963.Although [0] only gave written approval for limited wiretapping of Martin Luther King Jr.'s phones \"on a trial basis, for a month or so\", FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, who was suspicious of civil-rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. and viewed him as an upstart troublemaker extended the clearance so FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, who was suspicious of civil-rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. and viewed him as an upstart troublemaker's were \"unshackled\" to look for evidence in any areas of Martin Luther King Jr.'s life his men deemed worthy. wiretap continued through June 1966 and was revealed in 1968.During the 1960 campaign, [0] proposed an overhaul of American immigration and naturalization laws to ban discrimination based on national origin. [0] saw proposed as an extension of [0]'s planned civil rights agenda as president. an overhaul of American immigration and naturalization laws to ban discrimination based on national origin later became law through the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which dramatically shifted the source of immigration from Northern and Western European countries towards immigration from Latin America and Asia. an overhaul of American immigration and naturalization laws to ban discrimination based on national origin also shifted the emphasis on the selection of immigrants in favor of family reunification. the president's brother, Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts helped steer his civil rights bill through the Senate.Construction of the Kinzua Dam flooded 10,000 acres (4,000 hectares) of Seneca nation land that Seneca nation had occupied under the Treaty of 1794, and forced 600 Seneca to relocate to Salamanca, New York. [0] was asked by the American Civil Liberties Union to intervene and to halt Construction of the Kinzua Dam, but [0] declined, citing a critical need for flood control. [0] expressed concern about the plight of Seneca nation and directed government agencies to assist in obtaining more land, damages, and assistance to help mitigate Seneca nation's displacement.The Apollo program was conceived early in 1960, during the Eisenhower administration, as a follow-up to Project Mercury, to be used as a shuttle to an Earth-orbital space station, flights around the Moon, or landing on the Moon. While NASA went ahead with planning for The Apollo program, funding for The Apollo program was far from certain, given Eisenhower's ambivalent attitude to crewed spaceflight. As senator, [0] had been opposed to The Apollo program and wanted to terminate The Apollo program.In constructing [0]'s presidential administration, [0] elected to retain Eisenhower's last science advisor Jerome Wiesner as head of the president's Science Advisory Committee. Eisenhower's last science advisor Jerome Wiesner was strongly opposed to crewed space exploration, having issued a report highly critical of Project Mercury.

Webb, an experienced Washington insider who served President Truman as budget director and undersecretary of state. James E. Webb, an experienced Washington insider who served President Truman as budget director and undersecretary of state proved to be adept at obtaining the support of Congress, the president, and the American people. [0] also persuaded Congress to amend the National Aeronautics and Space Act to allow [0] to delegate [0]'s chairmanship of the National Aeronautics and Space Council to the Vice President,both because of the knowledge of the space program his successor Johnson gained in the Senate working for the creation of NASA, and to help keep the politically savvy his successor Johnson occupied.In [0]'s January 1961 State of the Union address, [0] suggested international cooperation in space. Khrushchev declined, as the Soviets did not wish to reveal the status of the Soviets's rocketry and space capabilities.

[0] now became eager for the nation's to take the lead in the Space Race, for reasons of national security and prestige. On April 20, [0] sent a memo to his successor Johnson, asking his successor Johnson to look into the status of The Apollo program, and into programs that could offer NASA the opportunity to catch up. After consulting with Wernher von Braun, his successor Johnson responded approximately one week later, concluding that \"we are neither making maximum effort nor achieving results necessary if the nation's is to reach a position of leadership\". his successor Johnson's concluded that a crewed Moon landing was far enough in the future that it was likely the nation's would achieve a crewed Moon landing first. [0]'s advisor Ted Sorensen advised [0] to support the the Moon landing, and on May 25, [0] announced the goal in a speech titled \"Special Message to Congress on Urgent National Needs\":... [0] believe that the nation's should commit the nation's to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning a man safely to the Moon. No single space project in this decade will be more impressive to mankind, or more important for the long-range exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish.

[0] took the latter occasion as an opportunity to deliver another speech at Rice University in Houston to promote the space effort on September 12, 1962, in which [0] said: No nation which expects to be the leader of other nations can expect to stay behind in this race for space. ...\u00a0We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because the other things are easy, but because the other things are hard. Full text\u00a0 On November 21, 1962, in a cabinet meeting with NASA administrator Webb and other officials, [0] explained that the price increase was important for reasons of international prestige, and that the expense was justified. his successor Johnson assured [0] that lessons learned from The Apollo program had military value as well. Costs for The Apollo program were expected to reach $40\u00a0billion (equivalent to $386.97\u00a0billion in 2022).In a September 1963 speech before the United Nations, [0] urged cooperation between the Soviets and Americans in space, specifically recommending that The Apollo program be switched to \"a joint expedition to the Moon\". Khrushchev again declined, and the Soviets did not commit to a crewed the Moon mission until 1964. On July 20, 1969, almost six years after [0]'s , Apollo 11 landed the first crewed spacecraft on the Moon.", "Judicial appointments": "[0] is our person to focus on.

A Gallup Poll in November 2013 showed 61% believed in a conspiracy, and only 30% thought that Lee Harvey Oswald, an order filler at the Texas School Book Depository from which the shots were fired did assassinated alone. In 1979, the U.S. House Select Committee on Assassinations concluded, with one third of the U.S. House Select Committee on Assassinations dissenting, that the U.S. House Select Committee on Assassinations believed \"that [0] was probably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy. the U.S. House Select Committee on Assassinations was unable to identify the other gunmen or the extent of a conspiracy.\" This conclusion was based largely on audio recordings of assassinated.

Kennedy and his wife were younger than the presidents and first ladies who preceded Kennedy and his wife, and Kennedy and his wife were popular in the media culture in ways more common to pop singers and movie stars than politicians, influencing fashion trends and becoming the subjects of numerous photo spreads in popular magazines. Although Eisenhower had allowed presidential press conferences to be filmed for television, [0] was the first president to ask for presidential press conferences to be broadcast live and made good use of television.

Grant.[0]'s continuation of Presidents Harry S. Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower's policies of giving economic and military aid to South Vietnam left the door open for President Lyndon B. Johnson, Kennedy's successor,'s escalation of the conflict. At the time of Kennedy's death, no final policy decision had been made as to Vietnam, leading historians, cabinet members, and writers to continue to disagree on whether the conflict would have escalated to the point the conflict did had [0] survived. [0]'s agreement to the NSAM 263 action of withdrawing 1,000 troops by the end of 1963, and [0]'s earlier 1963 speech at American University, suggest that [0] was ready to end the conflict. the conflict contributed greatly to a decade of national difficulties, amid violent disappointment on the political landscape.Many of [0]'s speeches (especially his inaugural address) are considered iconic; and despite his relatively short term in office, and the lack of major legislative changes coming to fruition during his relatively short term in office, [0] is considered by many presidential historians to be in the upper echelon of presidents.

White's influential essay, which included the Camelot story, was published in a special commemorative issue of Life magazine on December 3, 1963, reaching over 30 million people. To the grieving public, this uplifting message seemed logical. After all, [0], displayed intelligence, articulation, and humor. Furthermore, [0]'s young, beautiful wife, who was revered internationally, along with [0]'s famous family, made it easy to associate [0] with the legend of King Arthur. Later, journalist Theodore H. White expressed regret for journalist Theodore H. White's role in popularizing the myth.
