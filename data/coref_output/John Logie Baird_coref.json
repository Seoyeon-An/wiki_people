{"summary": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. John Logie Baird FRSE (/\u02c8lo\u028a\u0261i b\u025b\u0259rd/; 13 August 1888\u00a0\u2013 14 June 1946) was a Scottish inventor, electrical engineer, and innovator who demonstrated the world's first live working television system on 26 January 1926. [0] went on to invent the first publicly demonstrated colour television system and the first viable purely electronic colour television picture tube.In 1928 the Baird Television Development Company achieved the first transatlantic television transmission. [0]'s early technological successes and [0]'s role in the practical introduction of broadcast television for home entertainment have earned [0] a prominent place in television's history.In 2006, [0] was named as one of the 10 greatest Scottish scientists in history, having been listed in the National Library of Scotland's 'Scottish Science Hall of Fame'. In 2015 [0] was inducted into the Scottish Engineering Hall of Fame. In 2017, IEEE unveiled a bronze street plaque at 22 Frith Street (Bar Italia), London, dedicated to [0] and the invention of television. In 2021, the Royal Mint unveiled a [0] 50p coin commemorating the 75th anniversary of [0]'s death."}, "Early years": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was born on 13 August 1888 in Helensburgh, Dunbartonshire, and was the youngest of four children of the Reverend John Baird, the Church of Scotland's minister for the local St Bride's Church, and Jessie Morrison Inglis, the orphaned niece of the wealthy Inglis family of shipbuilders from Glasgow.[0] was educated at Larchfield Academy (now part of Lomond School) in Helensburgh, Dunbartonshire; the Glasgow and West of Scotland Technical College; and the University of Glasgow. While at college, [0] undertook a series of engineering apprentice jobs as part of [0]'s . The conditions in industrial Glasgow at the time helped form [0]'s socialist convictions but also contributed to [0]'s ill health. [0] became an agnostic, though became did not strain [0]'s relationship with the Reverend John Baird, the Church of Scotland's minister for the local St Bride's Church. [0]'s was interrupted by the First World War and [0] never returned to graduate.At the beginning of 1915 [0] volunteered for service in the British Army but was classified as unfit for active duty. Unable to go to the front, [0] took a job with the Clyde Valley Electrical Power Company, which was engaged in munitions work.[page\u00a0needed]"}, "Television experiments": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. In early 1923, and in poor health, [0] moved to 21 Linton Crescent, Hastings, on the south coast of England. [0] later rented a workshop in the Queen's Arcade in Hastings, on the south coast of England. [0] built what was to become the world's first working television set using items that included an old hatbox and a pair of scissors, some darning needles, a few bicycle light lenses, a used tea chest, and sealing wax and glue that [0] purchased. In February 1924, [0] demonstrated to the Radio Times that a semi-mechanical analogue television system was possible by transmitting moving silhouette images. In July of 1924, [0] received a 1000-volt electric shock but survived with only a burnt hand but, as a result, [0]'s landlord, Mr Tree, asked [0] to vacate the premises.  Soon after arriving in London, looking for publicity, [0] visited the Daily Express newspaper to promote [0]'s invention. The news editor was terrified and The news editor was quoted by one of The news editor's staff as saying: \"For God's sake, go down to reception and get rid of a lunatic who's down there. a lunatic who's down there says a lunatic who's down there's got a machine for seeing by wireless! Watch a lunatic who's down there\u2014a lunatic who's down there may have a razor on a lunatic who's down there.\"In these attempts to develop a working television system, [0] experimented using the Nipkow disk. Paul Gottlieb Nipkow had invented the Nipkow disk in 1884. Television historian Albert Abramson calls Paul Gottlieb Nipkow's patent \"the master television patent\". Paul Gottlieb Nipkow's work is important because [0], followed by many others, chose to develop the Nipkow disk into a broadcast medium.In [0]'s laboratory on 2 October 1925, [0] successfully transmitted the first television picture with a greyscale image: the head of a ventriloquist's dummy nicknamed \"Stooky Bill\" in a 32-line vertically scanned image, at five pictures per second. [0] went downstairs and fetched an office worker, 20-year-old William Edward Taynton, to see what a human face would look like, and an office worker, 20-year-old William Edward Taynton became the first person to be televised in a full tonal range.In June 1924, [0] had bought from Cyril Frank Elwell a thallium sulphide (Thalofide) cell, developed by Theodore Case in the USA. a thallium sulphide (Thalofide) cell, developed by Theodore Case in the USA was part of the important new technology of 'talking pictures'. [0]'s pioneering implementation of a thallium sulphide (Thalofide) cell, developed by Theodore Case in the USA allowed [0] to become the first person to produce a live, moving, greyscale television image from reflected light. [0] achieved produce, where other inventors had failed, by applying two unique methods to a thallium sulphide (Thalofide) cell, developed by Theodore Case in the USA. [0] accomplished produce by improving the signal conditioning from a thallium sulphide (Thalofide) cell, developed by Theodore Case in the USA, through temperature optimisation (cooling) and [0]'s own custom-designed video amplifier.", "First public demonstrations": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] gave the first public demonstration of moving silhouette images by television at Selfridges department store in London in a three-week series of demonstrations beginning on 25 March 1925.On 26 January 1926, [0] gave the first public demonstration of true television images for members of the Royal Institution and a reporter from The Times in [0]'s laboratory at 22 Frith Street in the Soho district of London, where Bar Italia is now located. [0] initially used a scan rate of 5 pictures per second, improving a scan rate of 5 pictures per second to 12.5 pictures per second c.1927. the first public demonstration of true television images was the first demonstration of a television system that could scan and display live moving images with tonal graduation.[0] demonstrated the world's first colour transmission on 3 July 1928, using scanning discs at the transmitting and receiving ends with three spirals of apertures, each spiral with a filter of a different primary colour; and three light sources at the receiving end, with a commutator to alternate their illumination. demonstrated was of a young girl, 8-year-old Noele Gordon, wearing different coloured hats. a young girl, 8-year-old Noele Gordon went on to become a successful TV actress, famous for the soap opera Crossroads. 1928 [0] also demonstrated stereoscopic television.", "Broadcasting": "[0] is our person to focus on. In 1927, [0] transmitted a long-distance television signal over 438 miles (705\u00a0km) of telephone line between London and Glasgow; [0] transmitted the world's first long-distance television pictures to the Central Hotel at Glasgow Central Station.transmitted was [0]'s response to a 225-mile, long-distance telecast between stations of AT&T Bell Labs. stations of AT&T Bell Labs were in New York and Washington, DC. a 225-mile, long-distance telecast between stations of AT&T Bell Labs took place in April 1927, a month before [0]'s demonstration.[0] set up the Baird Television Development Company Ltd, which in 1928 made the first transatlantic television transmission, from London to Hartsdale, New York, and in 1929 the first television programmes officially transmitted by the BBC.  In November 1929, [0] and Bernard Natan established France's first television company, T\u00e9l\u00e9vision-Baird-Natan. Broadcast on the BBC on 14 July 1930, The Man with the Flower in His Mouth The Man with the Flower in His Mouth's was the first drama shown on UK television. the BBC transmitted [0]'s first live outside broadcast with the televising of The Derby in 1931. [0] demonstrated a theatre television system, with a screen two feet by five feet (60\u00a0cm by 150\u00a0cm), in 1930 at the London Coliseum, Berlin, Paris, and Stockholm. By 1939 [0] had improved [0]'s theatre projection to televise a boxing match on a screen 15\u00a0ft (4.6\u00a0m) by 12\u00a0ft (3.7\u00a0m).From 1929 to 1935, the the BBC transmitters were used to broadcast television programmes using the 30-line Baird system, and from 1932 to 1935 the BBC also produced television programmes using the 30-line Baird system in the BBC's own studio, first at Broadcasting House and then later at 16 Portland Place. In addition, from 1933 [0] and the Baird Company were producing and broadcasting a small number of television programmes independent of the BBC from [0]'s studios and transmitter at the Crystal Palace in south London.On 2 November 1936, from Alexandra Palace located on the high ground of the north London ridge, the BBC began alternating [0] 240-line transmissions with EMI's electronic scanning system, which had recently been improved to 405-lines after a merger with Marconi. The Baird system at the time involved an intermediate film process, where footage was shot on cinefilm, which was rapidly developed and scanned.[citation needed]  The trial was due to last for 6 months but the BBC ceased broadcasts with The Baird system in February 1937, due in part to a disastrous fire in the Baird facilities at Crystal Palace. It was becoming apparent to the BBC that The Baird system would ultimately fail due in large part to the lack of mobility of the Baird system's cameras, with the Baird system's cameras's developer tanks, hoses, and cables. Commercially Baird\u2019s contemporaries, such as George William Walton and William Stephenson, were ultimately more successful as Baird\u2019s contemporaries, such as George William Walton and William Stephenson's patents underpinned the early television system used by Scophony Limited who operated in Britain up to WWII and then in the US. \"Of all the electro-mechanical television techniques invented and developed by the mid 1930s, the early television system used by Scophony Limited who operated in Britain up to WWII and then in the US had no rival in terms of technical performance.\"[page\u00a0needed] In 1948 Scophony Limited who operated in Britain up to WWII and then in the US acquired John Logie Baird Ltd.[0]'s television systems were replaced by the first fully electronic television system developed by the newly formed company EMI-Marconi under Sir Isaac Shoenberg, who headed a research group that developed an advanced camera tube (the Emitron) and a relatively efficient hard-vacuum cathode-ray tube for the television receiver. Philo T. Farnsworth's electronic \"Image Dissector\" camera was available to the Baird Company via a patent-sharing agreement. However, Philo T. Farnsworth's electronic \"Image Dissector\" camera was found to be lacking in light sensitivity, requiring excessive levels of illumination. the Baird Company used the Farnsworth tubes Philo T. Farnsworth's instead to scan cinefilm, in which capacity the Farnsworth tubes proved serviceable though prone to drop-outs and other problems. Philo T. Farnsworth's came to London to the Baird facilities at Crystal Palace in 1936 but was unable to fully solve the problem; the fire that burned the Crystal Palace in south London to the ground later that year further hampered the Baird Company's ability to compete.", "Fully electronic": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] made many contributions to the field of electronic television after mechanical systems became obsolete. In 1939, [0] showed a system known today as hybrid colour using a cathode ray tube in front of which revolved a disc fitted with colour filters, a method taken up by CBS and RCA in the United States.As early as 1940, [0] had started work on a fully electronic system he called the \"Telechrome\". Early Telechrome devices used two electron guns aimed at either side of a phosphor plate. a phosphor plate was patterned so the electrons from two electron guns aimed at either side of a phosphor plate only fell on one side of patterned or the other. Using cyan and magenta phosphors, a reasonable limited-colour image could be obtained. [0] also demonstrated the same system using monochrome signals to produce a 3D image (called \"stereoscopic\" at the time).[citation needed] In 1941, [0] patented and demonstrated a fully electronic system he called the \"Telechrome\" at a definition of 500 lines.  On 16 August 1944, [0] gave the world's first demonstration of a practical fully electronic colour television display. [0]'s 600-line colour system used triple interlacing, using six scans to build each picture. Similar concepts were common through the 1940s and 50s, differing primarily in the way Similar concepts re-combined the colours generated by the three guns. One of Similar concepts, the Geer tube, was similar to [0]'s concept, but used small pyramids with the phosphors deposited on their outside facessmall pyramids with the phosphors deposited on their outside faces's , instead of [0]'s 3D patterning on a flat surface.[citation needed]In 1943, the Hankey Committee was appointed to oversee the resumption of television broadcasts after the war. [0] persuaded the Hankey Committee to make plans to adopt his proposed 1000-line Telechrome electronic colour system as the new post-war broadcast standard. The picture resolution on his proposed 1000-line Telechrome electronic colour system would have been comparable to today's HDTV (High Definition Television). plans to adopt his proposed 1000-line Telechrome electronic colour system as the new post-war broadcast standard lost all momentum partly due to the challenges of postwar reconstruction. The monochrome 405-line standard remained in place until 1985 in some areas, and the 625-line system was introduced in 1964 and (PAL) colour in 1967. A demonstration of large screen three-dimensional television by the BBC was reported in March 2008, over 60 years after [0]'s demonstration.[page\u00a0needed]"}, "Other inventions": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. Some of [0]'s early inventions were not fully successful. In [0]'s twenties [0] tried to create diamonds by heating graphite. Later [0] invented a glass razor, which was rust-resistant, but shattered. Inspired by pneumatic tyres [0] attempted to make pneumatic shoes, but [0]'s prototype contained semi-inflated balloons, which burst (years later this same idea was successfully adopted for Dr. Martens boots). [0] also invented a thermal undersock (the Baird undersock), which was moderately successful. [0] suffered from cold feet, and after a number of trials, [0] found that an extra layer of cotton inside the sock provided warmth.Between 1926 and 1928, [0] attempted to develop an early video recording device, which he dubbed Phonovision. an early video recording device, which he dubbed Phonovision consisted of a large Nipkow scanning disk attached by a mechanical linkage to a record-cutting lathe. The result was a disc that could record a 30-line video signal. Technical difficulties with an early video recording device, which he dubbed Phonovision prevented an early video recording device, which he dubbed Phonovision's further development, but some of the original an early video recording device, which he dubbed Phonovision discs have been preserved.[0]'s other developments were in fibre-optics, radio direction finding, infrared night viewing and radar. There is discussion about [0]'s exact contribution to the development of radar, for [0]'s wartime defence projects have never been officially acknowledged by the UK government. According to Malcolm Baird, [0]'s son, what is known is that in 1926 [0] filed a patent for a device that formed images from reflected radio waves, a device remarkably similar to radar, and that [0] was in correspondence with the British government at the time. The radar contribution is in dispute. According to some experts, a device that formed images from reflected radio waves, a device remarkably similar to radar is not radar. Unlike radar (except Doppler radar), Noctovision is incapable of determining the distance to the scanned subject. Noctovision also cannot determine the coordinates of the subject in three-dimensional space."}, "Death": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. From December 1944, [0] lived at 1 Station Road, Bexhill-on-Sea, East Sussex, [0] later died there on 14 June 1946 after suffering a stroke in February. 1 Station Road, Bexhill-on-Sea, East Sussex was demolished in 2007 and the site is now occupied by apartments named Baird Court. [0] is buried beside [0]'s parents in Helensburgh Cemetery, Argyll, Scotland."}, "Honours and portrayals": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. Australian television's Logie Awards were named in honour of [0]'s contribution to the invention of the television.[0] became the only deceased subject of This Is Your Life when [0] was honoured by Eamonn Andrews at the BBC Television Theatre in 1957.[citation needed]He was played by Michael Gwynn (and also by Andrew Irvine, who played [0] as a boy) in the 1957 TV film A Voice in Vision and by Robert McIntosh in the 1986 TV drama The Fools on the Hill.In 2014, the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) inducted [0] into The Honor Roll, which \"posthumously recognizes individuals who were not awarded Honorary Membership during their lifetimes but whose contributions would have been sufficient to warrant such an honor\"individuals who were not awarded Honorary Membership during their lifetimes but whose contributions would have been sufficient to warrant such an honor\"'s .On 26 January 2016, the search engine Google released a Google Doodle to mark the 90th anniversary of [0]'s first public demonstration of live television."}}
