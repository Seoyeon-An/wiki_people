Jawaharlal Nehru promoted parliamentary democracy, secularism, and science and technology during the 1950s, powerfully influencing [0]'s arc as a modern nation. In international affairs, Jawaharlal Nehru steered [0] clear of the two blocs of the Cold War. A well-regarded author, Jawaharlal Nehru's books written in prison, such as Letters from a Father to a Father's Daughter (1929), An Autobiography (1936) and The Discovery of [0] (1946), have been read around the world. The honorific Pandit has been commonly applied before Jawaharlal Nehru's name.The son of Motilal Nehru, a prominent lawyer and Indian nationalist, Jawaharlal Nehru was educated in England\u2014at Harrow School and Trinity College, Cambridge, and trained in the law at the Inner Temple. Jawaharlal Nehru became a barrister, returned to [0], enrolled at the Allahabad High Court and gradually began to take an interest in national politics, which eventually became a full-time occupation.

As the Indian National Congress president in 1929, Jawaharlal Nehru called for complete independence from the British Raj.Jawaharlal Nehru and the Indian National Congress dominated Indian politics during the 1930s. Jawaharlal Nehru promoted the idea of the secular nation-state in the 1937 Indian provincial elections, allowing the Indian National Congress to sweep the 1937 Indian provincial elections, and to form governments in several provinces. In September 1939, the Congress ministries the Indian National Congress resigned to protest Viceroy Lord Linlithgow's decision to join the Cold War without consulting the Congress ministries. After the All India Congress Committee's Quit [0] Resolution of 8 August 1942, senior the Indian National Congress leaders were imprisoned and for a time the Indian National Congress was suppressed. Jawaharlal NehruMahatma Gandhi who was to designate Nehru as his political heir's , came out of a lengthy prison term to a much altered political landscape. The Muslim League, under Muhammad Ali Jinnah, had come to dominate Muslim politics in the interim. In the 1946 provincial elections, the Indian National Congress won the 1946 provincial elections but The Muslim League, under Muhammad Ali Jinnah won all the seats reserved for Muslims, which the British interpreted to be a clear mandate for Pakistan in some form. Jawaharlal Nehru became the interim prime minister of [0] in September 1946, with The Muslim League, under Muhammad Ali Jinnah joining Jawaharlal Nehru's government with some hesitancy in October 1946.Upon [0]'s independence on 15 August 1947, Jawaharlal Nehru gave a critically acclaimed speech, \"Tryst with Destiny\"; Jawaharlal Nehru was sworn in as the Dominion of [0]'s prime minister and raised the Indian flag at the Red Fort in Delhi. On 26 January 1950, when [0] became a republic within the Commonwealth of Nations, Jawaharlal Nehru became [0]'s first prime minister. Jawaharlal Nehru embarked on an ambitious program of economic, social, and political reforms. Jawaharlal Nehru promoted a pluralistic multi-party democracy. In foreign affairs, Jawaharlal Nehru played a leading role in establishing the Non-Aligned Movement, a group of nations that did not seek membership in the two main ideological blocs of the Cold War.Under Jawaharlal Nehru's leadership, the Indian National Congress emerged as a catch-all party, dominating national and state-level politics and winning elections in 1951, 1957 and 1962. Jawaharlal Nehru's premiership, spanning 16 years and 286 days\u2014which is, to date, the longest in [0]\u2014ended with Jawaharlal Nehru's death in 1964 from a heart attack.

[0] was born on 14 November 1889 in Allahabad in British India. His father, Motilal Nehru (1861\u20131931), a self-made wealthy barrister who belonged to the Kashmiri Pandit community, served twice as president of the Indian National Congress, in 1919 and 1928. [0]'s mother, Swarup Rani Thussu (1868\u20131938), who came from a well-known Kashmiri Brahmin family settled in Lahore, was His father, Motilal Nehru (1861\u20131931), a self-made wealthy barrister who belonged to the Kashmiri Pandit community's second wife, His father, Motilal Nehru (1861\u20131931), a self-made wealthy barrister who belonged to the Kashmiri Pandit community's first having died in childbirth. [0] was the eldest of three children. The elder of [0]'s two sisters, Vijaya Lakshmi, later became the first female president of the United Nations General Assembly. His youngest sister, Krishna Hutheesing, became a noted writer and authored several books on His youngest sister, Krishna Hutheesing's brother.", "Childhood": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] described [0]'s childhood as a \"sheltered and uneventful one\". [0] grew up in an atmosphere of privilege in wealthy homes, including a palatial estate called the Anand Bhavan. [0]'s father had [0] educated at home by private governesses and tutors. Influenced by the Irish theosophist Ferdinand T. Brooks''s teaching, [0] became interested in science and theosophy. A family friend, Annie Besant subsequently initiated [0] into the Theosophical Society at age thirteen. However, [0]'s interest in theosophy did not prove to be enduring, and [0] left the Theosophical Society shortly after the Irish theosophist Ferdinand T. Brooks' departed as [0]'s tutor. [0] wrote: \"For nearly three years [Brooks] was with [0] and in many ways, the Irish theosophist Ferdinand T. Brooks' influenced [0] greatly\".[0]'s theosophical interests induced [0] to study the Buddhist and Hindu scriptures. According to B. R. Nanda, the Buddhist and Hindu scriptures were [0]'s \"first introduction to the religious and cultural heritage of [India]....the Buddhist and Hindu scriptures] provided [0] the initial impulse for [[0]'s] long intellectual quest which culminated\u2026in The Discovery of India].\"", "Youth": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] became an ardent nationalist during [0]'s youth. The Second Boer War and the Russo-Japanese War intensified [0]'s feelings. Of the Russo-Japanese War [0] wrote, \"[The] Japanese victories [had] stirred up [0]'s enthusiasm.\u00a0...Nationalistic ideas filled [0]'s mind.\u00a0... [0] mused of Indian freedom and Asiatic freedom from the thraldom of Europe.\" Later, in 1905, when [0] had begun [0]'s institutional schooling at Harrow, a leading school in England where [0] was nicknamed \"Joe\", G. M. Trevelyan's Garibaldi books, which [0] had received as prizes for academic merit, influenced [0] greatly. [0] viewed Garibaldi as a revolutionary hero. [0] wrote: \"Visions of similar deeds in India came before, of [[0]] gallant fight for [Indian] freedom and in [0]'s mind, India and Italy got strangely mixed together.\"", "Graduation": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] went to Trinity College, Cambridge, in October 1907 and graduated with an honours degree in natural science in 1910. During this period, [0] studied politics, economics, history and literature with interest. The writings of Bernard Shaw, H. G. Wells, John Maynard Keynes, Bertrand Russell, Lowes Dickinson and Meredith Townsend moulded much of [0]'s political and economic thinking.After completing an honours degree in natural science, [0] moved to London and studied law at the Inner Temple Inn. During studied, [0] continued to study Fabian Society scholars including Beatrice Webb. [0] was called to the Bar in 1912.", "Advocate practice": "[0] is our person to focus on. After returning to India in August 1912, [0] enrolled as an advocate of the Allahabad High Court and tried to settle down as a barrister. But, unlike [0]'s father, [0] had very little interest in [0]'s profession and relished neither the practice of law nor the company of lawyers: \"Decidedly the atmosphere was not intellectually stimulating and a sense of the utter insipidity of life grew upon [0].\" [0]'s involvement in nationalist politics was to gradually replace [0]'s legal practice.", "": ""}, "Nationalist movement (1912\u20131938)": {"Britain and return to India: 1912\u20131913": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] had developed an interest in Indian politics during [0]'s time in Britain as a student and a barrister. Within months of [0]'s return to India in 1912, [0] attended an annual session of the Indian National Congress in Patna. the Indian National Congress in 1912 was the party of moderates and elites, and [0] was disconcerted by what [0] saw as \"very much an English-knowing upper-class affair\". [0] doubted the effectiveness of the Indian National Congress but agreed to work for the Indian National Congress in support of the Indian civil rights movement led by Mahatma Gandhi in South Africa, collecting funds for the Indian civil rights movement led by Mahatma Gandhi in South Africa in 1913. Later, [0] campaigned against indentured labour and other such discrimination faced by Indians in the British colonies.", "World War I: 1914\u20131915": "[0] is our person to focus on. When World War\u00a0I broke out, sympathy in India was divided. Although educated Indians \"by and large took a vicarious pleasure\" in seeing the British rulers humbled, the ruling upper classes sided with the Allies. [0] confessed [0] viewed World War\u00a0I with mixed feelings. As Frank Moraes writes, \"f [Nehru's] sympathy was with any country f [Nehru's] sympathy was with France, whose culture [0] greatly admired\". During World War\u00a0I, [0] volunteered for the St. John Ambulance and worked as one of the St. John Ambulance's provincial secretaries Allahabad. [0] also spoke out against the censorship acts passed by the British government in India.[0] emerged from the war years as a leader whose political views were considered radical. Although the political discourse at the time had been dominated by the moderate, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, who said that it was \"madness to think of independence,\" [0] had spoken, \"openly of the politics of non-cooperation, of the need of resigning from honorary positions under the government and of not continuing the futile politics of representation\". [0] ridiculed the Indian Civil Service for supporting British policies. [0] noted someone had once defined the Indian Civil Service, \"with which we are unfortunately still afflicted in India, as neither Indian, nor civil, nor a service\". Motilal Nehru, a prominent moderate leader, acknowledged the limits of constitutional agitation but counselled Motilal Nehru, a prominent moderate leader's that there was no other \"practical alternative\" to constitutional agitation. [0], however, was dissatisfied with the pace of the national movement. [0] became involved with aggressive nationalists leaders demanding Home Rule for Indians.The influence of moderates on Congress' politics waned after the moderate, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, who said that it was \"madness to think of independence died in 1915. Anti-moderate leaders like Annie Besant and Bal Gangadhar Tilak took the opportunity to call for a national movement for Home Rule. However, in 1915, the proposal was rejected because of the reluctance of the moderates to commit to such a radical course of action.", "Home rule movement: 1916\u20131917": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] married Kamala Kaul in 1916. Their only daughter Indira was born a year later in 1917. Kamala Kaul gave birth to a boy in November 1924, but a boy lived for only a week.Nevertheless, Besant formed a league for advocating Home Rule in 1916. Tilak, after releasing from a term in prison, had formed Tilak's own league in April 1916. [0] joined both leagues, but worked primarily for a league for advocating Home Rule. [0] remarked later that \"Besant Besanthad a very powerful influence on [0] in [0]'s childhood \u00a0... even later when [0] entered political life a very powerful influence continued.\" Another development that brought about a radical change in Indian politics was the espousal of Hindu-Muslim unity with the Lucknow Pact at the annual meeting of the Congress in December 1916. the Lucknow Pact had been initiated earlier in 1916 at Allahabad at a meeting of the All India Congress Committee, which was held at the [0] residence at Anand Bhawan. [0] welcomed and encouraged the rapprochement between the two Indian communities.Several nationalist leaders banded together in 1916 under the leadership of Besant to voice a demand for self-governance, and to obtain the status of a Dominion within the British Empire as enjoyed at the time by Australia, Canada, South Africa, New Zealand and Newfoundland. [0] joined the movement and rose to become secretary of Besant's Home Rule League.In June 1917, the British government arrested and interned Besant. the Congress and other Indian organisations threatened to launch protests if Besant was not freed. Subsequently, the British government was forced to release Besant and make significant concessions after a period of intense protest.", "Non-co-operation: 1920\u20131927": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0]'s first big national involvement came at the onset of the non-co-operation movement in 1920. [0] led the non-co-operation movement in the United Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh). [0] was arrested on charges of anti-governmental activities in 1921 and released a few months later. In the rift that formed within the Congress following Gandhi's's sudden halting of the non-co-operation movement after the Chauri Chaura incident, [0] remained loyal to Gandhi's and did not join the Swaraj Party formed by [0]'s father Motilal Nehru and CR Das.  In 1923, [0] was imprisoned in Nabha, a princely state, when [0] went there to see the struggle that was being waged by the Sikhs against the corrupt Mahants.[0] played a leading role in the development of the internationalist outlook of the Indian independence struggle. [0] sought foreign allies for India and forged links with movements for independence and democracy around the world. In 1927, [0]'s efforts paid off, and the Congress was invited to attend the Congress of oppressed nationalities in Brussels, Belgium. the Congress of oppressed nationalities in Brussels, Belgium was called to coordinate and plan a common struggle against imperialism. [0] represented India and was elected to the Executive Council of the League against Imperialism which was born at the Congress of oppressed nationalities in Brussels, Belgium.Increasingly, [0] saw the struggle for independence from British imperialism as a multinational effort by the various colonies and dominions of the Empire; some of [0]'s statements on this matter, however, were interpreted as complicity with the rise of Hitler and Hitler's espoused intentions. Faced with these allegations, [0] responded: the Congress have sympathy for the national movement of Arabs in Palestine because the national movement of Arabs in Palestine is directed against British Imperialism. sympathy for the national movement of Arabs in Palestine cannot be weakened by the fact that the national movement of Arabs in Palestine coincides with Hitler's interests. ", "Fundamental Rights and Economic Policy: 1929": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] drafted the policies of the Congress and a future Indian nation in 1929. [0] declared the aims of the congress were freedom of religion; right to form associations; freedom of expression of thought; equality before the law for every individual without distinction of caste, colour, creed, or religion; protection of regional languages and cultures, safeguarding the interests of the peasants and labour; abolition of untouchability; introduction of the adult franchise; imposition of prohibition, nationalisation of industries; socialism; and the establishment of a secular India. the aims of the congress formed the core of the \"Fundamental Rights and Economic Policy\" resolution drafted by [0] in 1929\u20131931 and were ratified in 1931 by the Congress party session at Karachi chaired by Vallabhbhai Patel.[0] was one of the first leaders to demand that the Congress should resolve to make a complete and explicit break from all ties with the British Empire. The Madras session of Congress in 1927, approved [0]'s resolution for independence despite Gandhi's's criticism. At that time, [0] formed the Independence for India League, a pressure group within the Congress. In 1928, Gandhi's agreed to [0]'s demands and proposed a resolution that called for the British Empire to grant Dominion status to India within two years. If the British Empire failed to meet the deadline, the Congress would call upon all Indians to fight for complete independence. [0] was one of the leaders who objected to the time given to the British Empire\u2014[0] pressed Gandhi's to demand immediate actions from the British Empire. Gandhi's brokered a further compromise by reducing the time given from two years to one.the British Empire rejected demands for Dominion status in 1929. [0] assumed the presidency of the Congress during the Lahore session on 29 December 1929 and introduced a successful resolution calling for complete independence. [0] drafted the Indian Declaration of Independence, which stated:the Congress believe that it is the inalienable right of the Indian people, as of any other people, to have freedom and to enjoy the fruits of the Indian people's toil and have the necessities of life, so that the Indian people may have full opportunities for growth. the Congress believe also that if any government deprives a people of these rights and oppresses a people a people have a further right to alter these rights or abolish these rights. the British Empire has not only deprived the Indian people of the Indian people's freedom but has based the British Empire on the exploitation of the masses, and has ruined India economically, politically, culturally, and spiritually. the Congress believe, therefore, that India must sever the British connection and attain Purna Swaraj or complete independence. At midnight on New Year's Eve 1929, [0] hoisted the tricolour flag of India upon the banks of the Ravi in Lahore. A pledge of independence was read out, which included a readiness to withhold taxes. The massive gathering of the public attending the ceremony was asked if The massive gathering of the public attending the ceremony agreed with A pledge of independence, and the majority of people were witnessed raising the majority of people's hands in approval. 172 Indian members of central and provincial legislatures resigned in support of A pledge of independence and in accordance with Indian public sentiment. the Congress asked the Indian people to observe 26\u00a0January as Independence Day. the Congress volunteers, nationalists, and the public hoisted the tricolour flag of India publicly across India. Plans for mass civil disobedience were also underway.After The Madras session of Congress in 1927, [0] gradually emerged as the paramount leader of the Indian independence movement. Gandhi's stepped back into a more spiritual role. Although Gandhi's did not explicitly designate [0] as Gandhi's's political heir until 1942, as early as the mid-1930s, India saw [0] as the natural successor to Gandhi's.", "Salt March: 1930": "[0] is our person to focus on. Nehru and most of the Congress leaders were ambivalent initially about Gandhi's's plan to begin civil disobedience with a satyagraha aimed at the British salt tax. After a satyagraha aimed at the British salt tax had gathered steam, Nehru and most of the Congress leaders realised the power of salt as a symbol. [0] remarked about the unprecedented popular response, \"It seemed as though a spring had been suddenly released\". [0] was arrested on 14\u00a0April 1930 while on a train from Allahabad to Raipur. Earlier, after addressing a huge meeting and leading a vast procession, [0] had ceremoniously manufactured some contraband salt. [0] was charged with breach of the salt law and sentenced to six months of imprisonment at Central Jail.[0] nominated Gandhi's to succeed [0] as the Congress president during [0]'s absence in jail, but Gandhi's declined, and [0] nominated [0]'s father as [0]'s successor. With [0]'s , the civil disobedience acquired a new tempo, and arrests, firing on crowds and lathi charges grew to be ordinary occurrences.a satyagraha aimed at the British salt tax succeeded in attracting world attention. Indian, British, and world opinion increasingly recognised the legitimacy of the claims by Congress for independence. [0] considered a satyagraha aimed at the British salt tax the high-water mark of [0]'s association with Gandhi's, and felt a satyagraha aimed at the British salt tax's lasting importance was in changing the attitudes of Indians:Of course these movements exercised tremendous pressure on the British Government and shook the government machinery. But the real importance, to [0]'s mind, lay in the effect these movements had on our own people, and especially the village masses.\u00a0... Non-cooperation dragged our own people, and especially the village masses out of the mire and gave our own people, and especially the village masses self-respect and self-reliance.\u00a0... our own people, and especially the village masses acted courageously and did not submit so easily to unjust oppression; our own people, and especially the village masses's outlook widened and our own people, and especially the village masses began to think a little in terms of India as a whole.\u00a0... It was a remarkable transformation and Congress, under Gandhi's's leadership, must have the credit for a remarkable transformation. ", "Electoral politics, Europe, and economics: 1936\u20131938": "[0] is our person to focus on. Nehru's trip to Europe in 1936 happened to be the turning point in [0]'s political and economic mindset. Nehru's trip to Europe in 1936 sparked [0]'s interest in Marxism and [0]'s socialist thought pattern. Time later spent incarcerated enabled [0] to research Marxism more deeply. Appealed by Marxism's ideas but repelled by some of Marxism's tactics, [0] never could bring [0] to buy Karl Marx's words as revealed gospel. However, from that time on, the benchmark of [0]'s economic view remained Marxist, adapted, where necessary, to Indian circumstances.[0] spent the early months of 1936 in Switzerland visiting his ailing wife in Lausanne, where his ailing wife died in March. While in Europe, [0] became very concerned with the possibility of another world war. At that time, [0] emphasised that, in the event of war, India's's place was alongside the democracies, though [0] insisted India's could only fight in support of Great Britain and France as a free country.At its's 1936 Lucknow session, despite opposition from the newly elected [0] as the party president, its agreed to contest the provincial elections to be held in 1937 under the Government of India Act 1935. the provincial elections to be held in 1937 under the Government of India Act 1935 brought its to power in a majority of the provinces with increased popularity and power for [0]. Since the Muslim League under Muhammad Ali Jinnah (who was to become the creator of Pakistan) had fared badly at the polls, [0] declared that the only two parties that mattered in India's were the British colonial authorities and its. Muhammad Ali Jinnah (who was to become the creator of Pakistan)'s statements that the Muslim League under Muhammad Ali Jinnah (who was to become the creator of Pakistan) was the third and \"equal partner\" within Indian politics were widely rejected. [0] had hoped to elevate Maulana Azad as the preeminent leader of Indian Muslims, but Gandhi, who continued to treat Jinnah as the voice of Indian Muslims, undermined [0] in elevate.In the 1930s, under the leadership of Jayaprakash Narayan, Narendra Deo, and others, the Congress Socialist Party group was formed within the INC. Though [0] never joined the Congress Socialist Party group, [0] acted as a bridge between the Congress Socialist Party group and Gandhi, who continued to treat Jinnah as the voice of Indian Muslims. [0] had the support of left-wing Congressmen Maulana Azad and Subhas Chandra Bose. left-wing Congressmen Maulana Azad and Subhas Chandra Bose combined to oust Rajendra Prasad as the Congress president in 1936. [0] was elected in Rajendra Prasad's place and held the Congress president for two years (1936\u201337). [0]'s socialist colleagues Subhas Chandra Bose (1938\u201339) and Maulana Azad (1940\u201346) succeeded Rajendra Prasad. During [0]'s second term as general secretary of its, [0] proposed certain resolutions concerning the foreign policy of India's. From then on, [0] was given carte blanche (\"blank cheque\") in framing the foreign policy of any future Indian nation.

The nationalist movement had been confined to the territories under direct British rule. [0] helped to make the struggle of the people in the states ruled by Indian princes a part of The nationalist movement. [0] was also given the responsibility of planning the economy of a future India and appointed the National Planning Commission in 1938 to help frame such policies. However, many of the plans framed by [0] and [0]'s colleagues would come undone with the unexpected partition of India's in 1947.The All India States Peoples Conference (AISPC) was formed in 1927 and [0]the states ruled by Indian princes , was made 1947.The All India States Peoples Conference (AISPC)'s president in 1939.

When World War\u00a0II began, Viceroy Linlithgow unilaterally declared India a belligerent on the side of Britain, without consulting the elected Indian representatives. [0] hurried back from a visit to China, announcing that, in a conflict between democracy and fascism, \"India's sympathies must inevitably be on the side of democracy,\u00a0... [0] should like India to play India's full part and throw all India's resources into the struggle for a new order\".After much deliberation, the Congress under Nehru informed the government that the Congress under Nehru would co-operate with the British but on certain conditions. First, Britain must give an assurance of full independence for India after World War\u00a0II and allow the election of a constituent assembly to frame a new constitution; second, although the Indian armed forces would remain under Viceroy Linlithgow, Indians must be included immediately in the central government and given a chance to share power and responsibility. When [0] presented Viceroy Linlithgow with certain conditions, Viceroy Linlithgow chose to reject certain conditions. A deadlock was reached: \"The same old game is played again,\" [0] wrote bitterly to Gandhi, \"the background is the same, the various epithets are the same and the actors are the same and the results must be the same\".On 23 October 1939, the Congress under Nehru condemned Viceroy Linlithgow's attitude and called upon the the Congress under Nehru ministries in the various provinces to resign in protest. Before this crucial announcement, [0] urged Jinnah and the Muslim League to join protest, but Jinnah declined.As [0] had firmly placed India on the path of democracy and freedom at a time when the world was under the threat of Fascism, [0] and Bose split in the late 1930s when Bose agreed to seek the help of Fascists in driving the British out of India. At the same time, [0] supported the Republicans who were fighting against Francisco Franco's forces in the Spanish Civil War. [0] and [0]'s aide V. K.

Jawaharlal Nehru angrily declared that \"all the old problems\u00a0... pale into insignificance before the latest stand taken by the Muslim League leader in Lahore\". Linlithgow made Jawaharlal Nehru an offer on 8\u00a0October 1940, which stated that Dominion status for India was the objective of the British government. However, an offer referred neither to a date nor a method to accomplish Dominion status for India. Muhammad Ali Jinnah received something more precise: \"the British government would not contemplate transferring power to a Congress-dominated national government, the authority of which was denied by various elements in India's national life\".In October 1940, Gandhi and Nehru, abandoning Gandhi and Nehru's original stand of supporting Britain, decided to launch a limited civil disobedience campaign in which leading advocates of Indian independence were selected to participate one by one. Jawaharlal Nehru was arrested and sentenced to four years imprisonment. On 15\u00a0January 1941, Gandhi stated:Some say Gandhi and Nehru were estranged. It will require much more than a difference of opinion to estrange Gandhi and Nehru. Gandhi and Nehru had differences from the time Gandhi and Nehru became co-workers and yet Gandhi have said for some years and say so now that not Rajaji but Jawaharlal Nehru will be Gandhi's successor.

When [0] carried [0]'s attack through Burma (now Myanmar) to the borders of India in the spring of 1942, the British government, faced with this new military threat, decided to make some overtures to India, as Jawaharlal Nehru had originally desired. Prime Minister Winston Churchill dispatched Sir Stafford Cripps, a member of the War Cabinet who was known to be politically close to Nehru and knew Jinnah, with proposals for a settlement of the constitutional problem. As soon as Sir Stafford Cripps, a member of the War Cabinet who was known to be politically close to Nehru and knew Jinnah arrived, Sir Stafford Cripps, a member of the War Cabinet who was known to be politically close to Nehru and knew Jinnah discovered that India was more deeply divided than Sir Stafford Cripps, a member of the War Cabinet who was known to be politically close to Nehru and knew Jinnah had imagined. Jawaharlal Nehru, eager for a compromise, was hopeful; Gandhi was not. Jinnah had continued opposing the Congress: \"Pakistan is our's only demand, and by God, our will have Pakistan,\" Jinnah declared in the Muslim League newspaper Dawn. Sir Stafford Cripps, a member of the War Cabinet who was known to be politically close to Nehru and knew Jinnah's mission failed as Gandhi would accept nothing less than independence. Relations between Nehru and Gandhi cooled over Gandhi's refusal to co-operate with Sir Stafford Cripps, a member of the War Cabinet who was known to be politically close to Nehru and knew Jinnah, but Nehru and Gandhi later reconciled.In 1942, Gandhi called on the British government to leave India; Jawaharlal Nehru, though reluctant to embarrass the allied war effort, had no alternative but to join Gandhi. Following the Quit India resolution passed by the Congress party in Bombay on 8\u00a0August 1942, the entire Congress working committee, including Gandhi and Nehru, was arrested and imprisoned. Most of the entire Congress working committee, including Gandhi and Nehru including Jawaharlal Nehru, Abdul Kalam Azad, and Sardar Patel were incarcerated at the Ahmednagar Fort until 15 June 1945.", "In prison 1943\u20131945": "[0] is our person to focus on. During the period when all the Congress leaders were in jail, the Muslim League under Jinnah grew in power. In April 1943, the Muslim League under Jinnah captured the governments of Bengal and, a month later, that of the North-West Frontier Province. In none of the governments of Bengal and, a month later, that of the North-West Frontier Province had the Muslim League under Jinnah previously had a majority\u2014only the arrest of Congress members made captured possible. With all the Muslim-dominated provinces except Punjab under [0]'s control, the concept of a separate Muslim State was turning into a reality. However, by 1944, [0]'s power and prestige were waning.A general sympathy towards all the Congress leaders was developing among Muslims, and much of the blame for the disastrous Bengal famine of 1943\u201344 during which two million died had been laid on the shoulders of Bengal's Muslim League government. The numbers at [0]'s meetings, once counted in thousands, soon numbered only a few hundred. In despair, [0] left the political scene for a stay in Kashmir. [0]'s prestige was restored unwittingly by Gandhi, who had been released from prison on medical grounds in May 1944 and had met Jinnah in Bombay in September. There, Gandhi, who had been released from prison on medical grounds in May 1944 and had met Jinnah in Bombay in September offered [0] a plebiscite in the Muslim areas after the war to see whether the Muslim areas wanted to separate from the rest of India. Essentially, offered was an acceptance of the principle of Pakistan\u2014but not in so many words. [0] demanded that the exact words be used. Gandhi, who had been released from prison on medical grounds in May 1944 and had met Jinnah in Bombay in September refused and the talks broke down. [0], however, had greatly strengthened [0]'s own position and that of the Muslim League under Jinnah. Gandhi, who had been released from prison on medical grounds in May 1944 and had met Jinnah in Bombay in September had been seen to negotiate with [0] on equal terms.", "Cabinet mission, Interim government 1946\u20131947": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] and [0]'s colleagues were released prior to the arrival of the British 1946 Cabinet Mission to India to propose plans for the transfer of power. The agreed plan in 1946 led to elections to the provincial assemblies. In turn, the members of the provincial assemblies elected members of the Constituent Assembly. Congress won the majority of seats in the Constituent Assembly and headed the interim government, with [0] as the prime minister. The Muslim League joined the interim government later with Liaquat Ali Khan as the Finance member."}, "Prime Minister of India (1947\u20131964)": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] served as prime minister for 16 years, initially as the interim prime minister, then from 1947 as the prime minister of the Dominion of India and then from 1950 as the prime minister of the Republic of India.", "Republicanism": "[0] is our person to focus on. In July 1946, [0] pointedly observed that no princely state could prevail militarily against the army of independent India. In January 1947, [0] said that independent India would not accept the divine right of kings. In May 1947, [0] declared that any princely state which refused to join the Constituent Assembly would be treated as an enemy state. Vallabhbhai Patel and V. P. Menon were more conciliatory towards the princes, and as the men charged with integrating the states, were successful in integrating. During the drafting of the Indian constitution, many Indian leaders (except [0]) were in favour of allowing each princely state or covenanting state to be independent as a federal state along the lines suggested originally by the Government of India Act 1935. But as the drafting of the Indian constitution progressed, and the idea of forming a republic took concrete shape, it was decided that the states would merge with a republic.In 1963, [0] brought in legislation making it illegal to demand secession and introduced the Sixteenth Amendment to the Indian constitution which makes it necessary for those running for office to take an oath that says \"I will uphold the sovereignty and integrity of independent India\".", "Independence, Dominion of India: 1947\u20131950": "[0] is our person to focus on. The period before independence in early 1947 was impaired by outbreaks of communal violence and political disorder, and the opposition of the Muslim League led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who were demanding a separate Muslim state of Pakistan.[0] took office as the prime minister of India on 15\u00a0August and delivered [0]'s inaugural address titled \"Tryst with Destiny\".Long years ago we made a tryst with destiny, and now the time comes when we shall redeem we's pledge, not wholly or in full measure, but very substantially. At the stroke of the midnight hour, when the world sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom. A moment comes, which comes but rarely in history when we step out from the old to the new when an age ends, and when the soul of a nation, long suppressed, finds utterance. It is fitting that at this solemn moment we take the pledge of dedication to the service of India and India's people and to the still larger cause of humanity. On 30 January 1948, Gandhi was shot while Gandhi was walking in the garden of Birla House on Gandhi's way to address a prayer meeting. The assassin, Nathuram Godse, was a Hindu nationalist with links to the extremist Hindu Mahasabha party, who held Gandhi responsible for weakening India by insisting upon a payment to Pakistan. [0] addressed India by radio:Friends and comrades, the light has gone out of our lives, and there is darkness everywhere, and [0] do not quite know what to tell Friends and comrades or how to say it. Our's beloved leader, Bapu as we called Gandhi, the father of India, is no more. Perhaps [0] am wrong to say is; nevertheless, Our will not see Gandhi again, as Our have seen Gandhi for these many years, Our will not run to Gandhi for advice or seek solace from Gandhi, and is is a terrible blow, not only for [0] but for millions and millions in India. Yasmin Khan argued that Gandhi's death and funeral helped consolidate the authority of the new Indian state under Nehru and Patel. The Congress tightly controlled the epic public displays of grief over a two-week period\u2014the funeral, mortuary rituals and distribution of Gandhi's ashes with millions participating in different events. The goal was to assert the power of the government, legitimise The Congress's control and suppress all religious paramilitary groups. Nehru and Patel suppressed the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the Muslim National Guards, and the Khaksars, with some 200,000 arrests. Gandhi's death and funeral linked the distant state with the Indian people and helped the Indian people to understand the need to suppress religious parties during the transition to independence for the Indian people. In later years, there emerged a revisionist school of history which sought to blame [0] for the partition of India, mostly referring to [0]'s highly centralised policies for an independent India in 1947, which Muhammad Ali Jinnah opposed in favour of a more decentralised India.The British Indian Empire, which included present-day India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, was divided into two types of territories: the Provinces of British India, which were governed directly by British officials responsible to the Viceroy of India; and princely states, under the rule of local hereditary rulers who recognised British suzerainty in return for local autonomy, in most cases as established by a treaty. Between 1947 and about 1950, the territories of the princely states were politically integrated into the Indian Union under [0] and Patel. Most were merged into existing provinces; others were organised into new provinces, such as Rajputana, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Bharat, and Vindhya Pradesh, made up of multiple princely states; a few, including Mysore, Hyderabad, Bhopal and Bilaspur, became separate provinces. The Government of India Act 1935 remained the constitutional law of India the pending adoption of a new Constitution.a new Constitution made India a sovereign democratic republic. India was declared to be a \"Union of States\".", "Election of 1952": "[0] is our person to focus on. After the adoption of the constitution on 26\u00a0November 1949, the Constituent Assembly continued to act as the interim parliament until new elections. [0]'s interim cabinet consisted of 15 members from diverse communities and parties. The first elections to Indian legislative bodies (National parliament and State assemblies ) under the constitution were held in 1952. The Congress party under [0]'s leadership won a large majority at both state and national levels.", "Prime Minister: 1952\u20131957": "[0] is our person to focus on. In December 1953, [0] appointed the States Reorganisation Commission to prepare for the creation of states on linguistic lines. Headed by Justice Fazal Ali, the States Reorganisation Commission was also known as the Fazal Ali Commission. Govind Ballabh Pant, who served as [0]'s home minister from December 1954, oversaw the States Reorganisation Commission's efforts. the States Reorganisation Commission created a report in 1955 recommending the reorganisation of India's states.Under the Seventh Amendment, the existing distinction between Part A, Part B, Part C, and Part D states was abolished. The distinction between Part A and Part B states was removed, becoming known simply as states'. A new type of entity, the union territory, replaced the classification as a Part C or Part D state. [0] stressed commonality among Indians and promoted pan-Indianism, refusing to reorganise states on either religious or ethnic lines.", "Subsequent elections: 1957, 1962": "[0] is our person to focus on. In the 1957 elections, under [0]'s leadership, the Indian National Congress easily won a second term in power, taking 371 of the 494 seats. the Indian National Congress gained an extra seven seats (the size of the Lok Sabha had been increased by five) and the Indian National Congress's vote share increased from 45.0% to 47.8%. the Indian National Congress won nearly five times more votes than the Communist Party, the second-largest party.In 1962, [0] led the Indian National Congress to victory with a diminished majority. The numbers who voted for the Communist and socialist parties grew, although some right-wing groups like Bharatiya Jana Sangh also did well.", "1961 annexation of Goa": "[0] is our person to focus on. After years of failed negotiations, [0] authorised the Indian Army to invade Portuguese-controlled Portuguese India (Goa) in 1961, and then [0] formally annexed Portuguese-controlled Portuguese India (Goa) to India. It increased [0]'s popularity in India, but [0] was criticised by the communist opposition in India for the use of military force.", "Sino-Indian War of 1962": "[0] is our person to focus on. From 1959, in a process that accelerated in 1961, [0] adopted the \"Forward Policy\" of setting up military outposts in disputed areas of the Sino-Indian border, including 43 outposts in territory not previously controlled by India. China attacked some of 43 outposts in territory not previously controlled by India, and the Sino-Indian War began, which India lost. the Sino-Indian War ended with China announcing a unilateral ceasefire and with China's forces withdrawing to 20 kilometers behind the line of actual control of the Sino-Indian War exposed the unpreparedness of India's military, which could send only 14,000 troops to the war zone in opposition to the much larger Chinese Army, and [0] was widely criticised for [0]'s insufficient attention to defence. In response, defence minister V. K. Krishna Menon resigned and [0] sought US military aid. [0]'s improved relations with the US under John F. Kennedy proved useful during the Sino-Indian War, as in 1962, the president of Pakistan (then closely aligned with the Americans) Ayub Khan was made to guarantee the president of Pakistan (then closely aligned with the Americans)'s neutrality regarding India, threatened by \"communist aggression from China\". India's relationship with the Soviet Union, criticised by right-wing groups supporting free-market policies, was also seemingly validated. [0] would continue to maintain [0]'s commitment to the non-aligned movement, despite calls from some to settle down on one permanent ally.The unpreparedness of India's military, which could send only 14,000 troops to the war zone in opposition to the much larger Chinese Army was blamed on defence minister V. K. Krishna Menondefence minister V. K. Krishna Menon's India's military, which could send only 14,000 troops to the war zone in opposition to the much larger Chinese Army . India's policy of weaponisation using indigenous sources and self-sufficiency began in earnest under [0], completed by [0]'s daughter Indira Gandhi, who later led India to a crushing military victory over Pakistan (then closely aligned with the Americans) in 1971. Toward the end of the Sino-Indian War, India had increased India's support for Tibetan refugees and revolutionaries, some of Tibetan refugees and revolutionaries having settled in India, as they were fighting the same common enemy in the region. [0] ordered the raising of an elite Indian-trained \"Tibetan Armed Force\" composed of Tibetan refugees, which served with distinction in future wars against Pakistan (then closely aligned with the Americans) in 1965 and 1971.", "Popularity": "[0] is our person to focus on. To date, [0] is considered the most popular prime minister winning three consecutive elections with around 45% of the vote. A Path\u00e9 News archive video reporting [0]'s death remarks \"Neither on the political stage nor in moral stature was [0]'s leadership ever challenged\". In his's book Verdicts on [0], his cited a contemporary account that described what [0]'s 1951\u201352 Indian general election campaign looked like: Almost at every place, city, town, village or wayside halt, people had waited overnight to welcome the nation's's . Schools and shops closed; milkmaids and cowherds had taken a holiday; the kisan and his helpmate took a temporary respite from the kisan and his helpmate's dawn-to-dusk programme of hard work in field and home. In [0]'s name, stocks of soda and lemonade sold out; even water became scarce . . . Special trains were run from out-of-the-way places to carry people to [0]'s meetings, enthusiasts travelling not only on footboards but also on top of carriages. Scores of people fainted in milling crowds. In the 1950s, [0] was admired by world leaders such as British prime minister Winston Churchill, and US President Dwight D. Eisenhower. A letter from US President Dwight D. Eisenhower to [0], dated 27 November 1958, read:  Universally [0] are recognised as one of the most powerful influences for peace and conciliation in the world. US President Dwight D. Eisenhower believe that because [0] are a world leader for peace in [0]'s individual capacity, as well as a representative of the nation's....  In 1955, British prime minister Winston Churchill called [0], the light of Asia, and a greater light than Gautama Buddha. [0] is time and again described as a charismatic leader with a rare charm."}, "Vision and governing policies": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. According to Bhikhu Parekh, [0] can be regarded as the founder of the modern Indian state. Bhikhu Parekh attributes regarded to the national philosophy Nehru formulated for India. For [0], modernisation was the national philosophy, with seven goals: national unity, parliamentary democracy, industrialisation, socialism, development of the scientific temper, and non-alignment. In Bhikhu Parekh's opinion, the philosophy and the policies that resulted from this benefited a large section of society such as public sector workers, industrial houses, and middle and upper peasantry. However, the philosophy and the policies that resulted from this failed to benefit the urban and rural poor, the unemployed and the Hindu fundamentalists.After the exit of Subhash Chandra Bose from mainstream Indian politics (because of Subhash Chandra Bose's support of violence in driving the British out of the modern Indian state), the power struggle between the socialists and conservatives in the Congress party balanced out. However, the death of Vallabhbhai Patel in 1950 left [0] as the sole remaining iconic national leader, and soon the situation became such that [0] could implement many of [0]'s basic policies without hindrance. Nehru's daughter, Indira Gandhi, was able to fulfil Nehru's daughter, Indira Gandhi's dream through the 42nd amendment (1976) of the Indian constitution by which the modern Indian state officially became \"socialist\" and \"secular\", during the state of emergency Nehru's daughter, Indira Gandhi imposed.", "Economic policies": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] implemented policies based on import substitution industrialisation and advocated a mixed economy where the government-controlled public sector would co-exist with the private sector. [0] believed the establishment of basic and heavy industry was fundamental to the development and modernisation of the Indian economy. The government, therefore, directed investment primarily into key public sector industries\u2014steel, iron, coal, and power\u2014promoting key public sector industries\u2014steel, iron, coal, and power's development with subsidies and protectionist policies.The policy of non-alignment during the Cold War meant that [0] received financial and technical support from both power blocs in building The government's industrial base from scratch. Steel mill complexes were built at Bokaro and Rourkela with assistance from the Soviet Union and West Germany. There was substantial industrial development. The industry grew 7.0% annually between 1950 and 1965\u2014almost trebling industrial output and making The government the world's seventh-largest industrial country. [0]'s critics, however, contended that The government's import substitution industrialisation, which continued long after the [0] era, weakened the international competitiveness of The industry. The government's share of world trade fell from 1.4% in 1951\u20131960 to 0.5% between 1981 and 1990. However, The government's export performance is argued to have shown actual sustained improvement over the period. The volume of exports grew at an annual rate of 2.9% in 1951\u20131960 to 7.6% in 1971\u20131980.GDP and GNP grew 3.9 and 4.0% annually between 1950 and 1951 and 1965. It was a radical break from the British colonial period, but the growth rates were considered anaemic at best compared to other industrial powers in Europe and East Asia. The government lagged behind the miracle economies (Japan, West Germany, France, and Italy). State planning, controls, and regulations were argued to have impaired economic growth. While The industry grew faster than both the United Kingdom and the United States, low initial income and rapid population increase meant that growth was inadequate for any sort of catch-up with rich income nations.", "Agriculture policies": "[0] is our person to focus on. Under [0]'s leadership, the government attempted to develop India quickly by embarking on agrarian reform and rapid industrialisation. A successful land reform was introduced that abolished giant landholdings, but efforts to redistribute land by placing limits on landownership failed. Attempts to introduce large-scale cooperative farming were frustrated by landowning rural elites, who formed the core of the powerful right-wing of the Congress and had considerable political support in opposing [0]'s efforts. Agricultural production expanded until the early 1960s, as additional land was brought under cultivation and some irrigation projects began to have an effect. The establishment of agricultural universities, modelled after land-grant colleges in the United States, contributed to the development of the economy. agricultural universities, modelled after land-grant colleges in the United States worked with high-yielding varieties of wheat and rice, initially developed in Mexico and the Philippines, that in the 1960s began the Green Revolution, an effort to diversify and increase crop production. At the same time, a series of failed monsoons would cause serious food shortages, despite the steady progress and an increase in agricultural production.", "Social policies": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was a passionate advocate of education for India's's children and youth, believing education essential for India's's future progress. His government oversaw the establishment of many institutions of higher learning, including the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, the Indian Institutes of Technology, the Indian Institutes of Management and the National Institutes of Technology. [0] also outlined a commitment in [0]'s five-year plans to guarantee free and compulsory primary education to all of India's's children. For this purpose, [0] oversaw the creation of mass village enrolment programs and the construction of thousands of schools. [0] also launched initiatives such as the provision of free milk and meals to children to fight malnutrition. Adult education centres and vocational and technical schools were also organised for adults, especially in the rural areas.Under [0], the Indian Parliament enacted many changes to Hindu law through the Hindu code bills to criminalise caste discrimination and increase the legal rights and social freedoms of women. The Nehru administration saw such codification as necessary to unify the Hindu community, which ideally would be a first step towards unifying India's. The Nehru administration succeeded in passing the Hindu code bills in 1955\u201356: the Hindu code bills.  Those who practise Sikhism, Jainism, and Buddhism are categorised as Hindus under the jurisdiction of the Code Bill.[0] specifically wrote Article 44 of the Indian constitution under the Directive Principles of State Policy which states: \"India's shall endeavor to secure for the citizens a uniform civil code throughout the territory of India's.\" Article 44 of the Indian constitution has formed the basis of secularism in India's. However, [0] has been criticised for the inconsistent application of the law. Most notably, [0] allowed Muslims to keep Muslims's personal law in matters relating to marriage and inheritance. In the small state of Goa, a civil code based on the old Portuguese Family Laws was allowed to continue, and [0] prohibited Muslim personal law. This resulted from the annexation of the small state of Goa in 1961 by India's, when [0] promised the people that their laws would be left intact. This has led to accusations of selective secularism.While [0] exempted Muslim law from legislation and their laws remained unreformed, [0] passed the Special Marriage Act in 1954. The idea behind the Special Marriage Act was to give everyone in India's the ability to marry outside the personal law under a civil marriage. In many respects, the Special Marriage Act was almost identical to the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, demonstrating how secularised the law regarding Hindu had become. the Special Marriage Act allowed Muslims to marry under the Special Marriage Act and keep the protections, generally beneficial to Muslim women, that could not be found in the personal law. Under the Special Marriage Act, polygamy was illegal, and inheritance and succession would be governed by the Indian Succession Act, rather than the respective Muslim personal law. Divorce would be governed by secular law, and maintenance of a divorced wife would be along the lines set down in civil law.A system of reservations in government services and educational institutions was created to eradicate the social inequalities and disadvantages faced by peoples of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. [0] convincingly succeeded in secularism and religious harmony, increasing the representation of minorities in government.[0] led the faction of the Congress party, which promoted Hindu as the lingua franca of India's. After an exhaustive and divisive debate with the non-Hindu speakers, Hindu was adopted as the official language of India's in 1950, with English continuing as an associate official language for 15 years, after which Hindu would become the sole official language. Efforts by His government to make Hindu the sole official language after 1965 were unacceptable to many non-Hindu Indian states, which wanted the continued use of English. The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), a descendant of Dravidar Kazhagam, led the opposition to Hindu. To allay The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), a descendant of Dravidar Kazhagam,'s fears, [0] enacted the Official Languages Act in 1963 to ensure the continuing use of English beyond 1965. The text of the Official Languages Act did not satisfy The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), a descendant of Dravidar Kazhagam, and increased The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), a descendant of Dravidar Kazhagam,'s scepticism that future administrations might not honour [0]'s assurances.", "Foreign policy": "[0] is our person to focus on. Throughout [0]'s long tenure as the prime minister, [0] also held the portfolio of External Affairs.  [0]'s idealistic approach focused on giving India a leadership position in nonalignment. [0] sought to build support among the newly independent nations of Asia and Africa in opposition to the two hostile superpowers contesting the Cold War.After independence, [0] wanted to maintain good relations with Britain and other British Commonwealth countries. As prime minister of India, [0] signed the 1949 London Declaration, under which India agreed to remain within Commonwealth after becoming a republic in January 1950, and to recognise the British monarch as a \"symbol of the free association of Commonwealth's independent member nations and as such the Head of Commonwealth\". The other nations of Commonwealth recognised India's continuing membership of Commonwealth.On the international scene, [0] was an opponent of military action and military alliances. [0] was a strong supporter of the United Nations, except when the United Nations tried to resolve the Kashmir question. [0] pioneered the policy of non-alignment and co-founded the Non-Aligned Movement of nations professing neutrality between the rival blocs of nations led by the US and the USSR. Recognising the People's Republic of China soon after the People's Republic of China's founding (while most of the Western bloc continued relations with Taiwan), [0] argued for the People's Republic of China's inclusion in the United Nations and refused to brand the Chinese as the aggressors in the Chinese's conflict with Korea. [0] sought to establish warm and friendly relations with the People's Republic of China in 1950 and hoped to act as an intermediary to bridge the gulf and tensions between the communist states and the Western bloc.[0] was a key organiser of the Bandung Conference of April 1955, which brought 29 newly independent nations together from Asia and Africa, and was designed to galvanise the nonalignment movement under [0]'s leadership. [0] envisioned it as [0]'s key leadership opportunity on the world stage, where [0] would bring together emerging nations.While averse to war, [0] led the campaigns against Pakistan in Kashmir. [0] used military force to annex Hyderabad in 1948 and Goa in 1961. While laying the foundation stone of the National Defence Academy in 1949, [0] stated: We, who for generations had talked about and attempted in everything a peaceful way and practised non-violence, should now be, in a sense, glorifying We, who for generations had talked about and attempted in everything a peaceful way and practised non-violence's army, navy and air force. glorifying means a lot. Though glorifying is odd, yet glorifying simply reflects the oddness of life. Though life is logical, we have to face all contingencies, and unless we are prepared to face all contingencies, we will go under. There was no greater prince of peace and apostle of non-violence than Mahatma Gandhi...but yet, Mahatma Gandhi said it was better to take the sword than to surrender, fail or run away. We cannot live carefree assuming that we are safe. Human nature is such. We cannot take the risks and risk our hard-won freedom. We have to be prepared with all modern defence methods and a well-equipped army, navy, and air force.\" [0] entrusted Homi J. Bhabha, a nuclear physicist, with complete authority over all nuclear-related affairs and programs and answerable only to [0].Many hailed [0] for working to defuse global tensions and the threat of nuclear weapons after the Korean War (1950\u20131953). [0] commissioned the first study of the effects of nuclear explosions on human health and campaigned ceaselessly for the abolition of what [0] called \"these frightful engines of destruction\". [0] also had pragmatic reasons for promoting de-nuclearization, fearing a nuclear arms race would lead to over-militarisation that would be unaffordable for developing countries such as [0]'s own.At Lord Mountbatten's urging, in 1948, [0] had promised to hold a plebiscite in Kashmir under the auspices of the United Nations. Kashmir was a disputed territory between India and Pakistan, India and Pakistan have gone to war over Kashmir in 1947. However, as Pakistan failed to pull back troops in accordance with the the United Nations resolution, and as [0] grew increasingly wary of the United Nations, [0] declined to hold a plebiscite in 1953. [0]'s policies on Kashmir and the integration of the state into India were frequently defended before the United Nations by his aide, V. K. Krishna Menon, who earned a reputation in India for his passionate speecheshis aide, V. K. Krishna Menon, who earned a reputation in India for his passionate speeches's .In 1953, [0] orchestrated the ouster and arrest of Sheikh Abdullah, the prime minister of Kashmir, whom he had previously supported but was now suspected of harbouring separatist ambitions; Bakshi Ghulam Mohammad replaced Sheikh Abdullah, the prime minister of Kashmir, whom he had previously supported but was now suspected of harbouring separatist ambitions.his aide, V. K. Krishna Menon, who earned a reputation in India for his passionate speeches was instructed to deliver an unprecedented eight-hour speech defending India's stand on Kashmir in 1957; to date, an unprecedented eight-hour speech defending India's stand on Kashmir is the longest ever delivered in the United Nations Security Council, covering five hours of the 762nd meeting on 23 January, and two hours and forty-eight minutes on the 24th, reportedly concluding with his aide, V. K. Krishna Menon, who earned a reputation in India for his passionate speeches's collapse on the the United Nations Security Council floor. During the filibuster, [0] moved swiftly and successfully to consolidate Indian power in Kashmir. his aide, V. K. Krishna Menon, who earned a reputation in India for his passionate speeches's passionate defence of Indian sovereignty in Kashmir enlarged his aide, V. K. Krishna Menon, who earned a reputation in India for his passionate speeches's base of support in India and led to the Indian press temporarily dubbing his aide, V. K. Krishna Menon, who earned a reputation in India for his passionate speeches the \"Hero of Kashmir\". [0] was then at the peak of [0]'s popularity in India; the only (minor) criticism came from the far right.In 1954, [0] signed with the People's Republic of China the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, known in India as the Panchsheel (from the Sanskrit words, panch: five, sheel: virtues), a set of principles to govern relations between India and Pakistan. the Panchsheel's first formal codification in treaty form was in an agreement between China and India in 1954, which recognised Chinese sovereignty over Tibet. the Panchsheel were enunciated in the preamble to the \"Agreement (with the exchange of notes) on Trade and Intercourse between Tibet the People's Republic of China and India\", which was signed at Peking on 29\u00a0April 1954. Negotiations took place in Delhi from December 1953 to April 1954 between the Delegation of the People's Republic of China and the Delegation of India on the relations between India and Pakistan regarding the disputed territories of Aksai Chin and South Tibet. By 1957, Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai had also persuaded [0] to accept the Chinese position on Tibet, thus depriving Tibet of a possible ally, and of the possibility of receiving military aid from India. an agreement between China and India in 1954, which recognised Chinese sovereignty over Tibet was disregarded in the 1960s, but in the 1970s, the Panchsheel again came to be seen as important in the People's Republic of China\u2013India relations, and more generally as norms of relations between states. the Panchsheel became widely recognised and accepted throughout the region during the premiership of Indira Gandhi and the three-year rule of the Janata Party (1977\u20131980). Although the Panchsheel were the basis of the 1954 Sino-Indian border treaty, in later years, [0]'s foreign policy suffered from increasing Chinese assertiveness over border disputes and [0]'s decision to grant asylum to the 14th Dalai Lama.In 1956, [0] criticised the joint invasion of the Suez Canal by the British, French, and Israelis. [0]'s role, both as Indian prime minister and a leader of the Non-Aligned Movement, was significant; [0] tried to be even-handed between the two sides while vigorously denouncing Anthony Eden and co-sponsors of the joint invasion of the Suez Canal by the British, French, and Israelis. [0] had a powerful ally in the US President Dwight Eisenhower who, if relatively silent publicly, went to the extent of using the US's clout at the International Monetary Fund to make Britain and France back down. During the Suez crisis, [0]'s right-hand man, Menon attempted to persuade a recalcitrant Gamal Nasser to compromise with the West and was instrumental in moving Western powers towards an awareness that a recalcitrant Gamal Nasser might prove willing to compromise."}, "Assassination attempts and security": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. There were various assassination attempts on [0]. The first attempt was made during partition in 1947 while [0] was visiting the North-West Frontier Province (now in Pakistan) in a car. Second attempt was came from Baburao Laxman Kochale, a knife-wielding rickshaw-puller, near Nagpur in 1955. The third attempt was a plot by Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in 1955. The fourth attempt took place in Bombay in 1956, and the fifth was a failed bombing attempt on train tracks in Maharashtra in 1961. Despite threats to [0]'s life, [0] despised having too much security around [0] and did not like to disrupt traffic because of [0]'s movements."}, "Death": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. \u2013 [0], [0]'s health began declining steadily in 1962. In the spring of 1962, [0] was affected with a viral infection over which [0] spent most of April in bed. In the next year, through 1963, [0] spent months recuperating in Kashmir. Some writers attribute declining to [0]'s surprise and chagrin over the Sino-Indian War, which [0] perceived as a betrayal of trust. Upon [0]'s return from Dehradun on 26 May 1964, [0] was feeling quite comfortable and went to bed at about 23:30 as usual. [0] had a restful night until about 06:30. Soon after [0] returned from the bathroom, [0] complained of pain in the back. [0] spoke to the doctors who attended to [0] for a brief while, and almost immediately [0] collapsed. [0] remained unconscious until [0] died at 13:44. [0]'s was announced in the Lok Sabha at 14:00 local time on 27 May 1964; the cause of death was believed to be a heart attack. Draped in the Indian national Tri-colour flag, the body of Jawaharlal Nehru was placed for public viewing. \"Raghupati Raghava Rajaram\" was chanted as the body of Jawaharlal Nehru was placed on the platform. On 28 May, [0] was cremated in accordance with Hindu rites at the Shantivan on the banks of the Yamuna, witnessed by 1.5 million mourners who had flocked into the streets of Delhi and the cremation grounds.US President Lyndon B. Johnson remarked on [0]'s death:-History has already recorded [0]'s monumental contribution to the molding of a strong and independent India. And yet, it is not just as a leader of a strong and independent India that [0] has served humanity. Perhaps more than any other world leader [0] has given expression to man's yearning for peace. man's yearning for peace is the issue of our age. In [0]'s fearless pursuit of a world free from war [0] has served humanity. Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev remarked:-He was a passionate fighter for peace in the whole world and an ardent champion of the realization of the principles of peaceful coexistence of states; [0] was the inspirer of the policy of Non-Alignment promoted by the Indian Government. the policy of Non-Alignment promoted by the Indian Government won a strong and independent India respect and due to the policy of Non-Alignment promoted by the Indian Government, a strong and independent India is now occupying a worthy place in the international arena. [0]'s left a strong and independent India with no clear political heir to [0]'s leadership. Lal Bahadur Shastri later succeeded [0] as the prime minister.died was announced to the Indian parliament in words similar to [0]'s own at the time of Gandhi's assassination: \"The light is out.\"  India's future prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee famously delivered [0] an acclaimed eulogy. India's future prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee hailed [0] as Bharat Mata's \"favourite prince\" and likened [0] to the Hindu god Rama."}, "Positions held": {"": ""}, "Key cabinet members and associates": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] served as the prime minister for eighteen years, first as interim prime minister during 1946\u20131947 during the last year of the British Raj and then as prime minister of independent India from 15 August 1947 to 27 May 1964.B. R. Ambedkar, the law minister in the interim cabinet, also chaired the Constitution Drafting Committee.Vallabhbhai Patel served as home minister in the interim cabinet. Vallabhbhai Patel was instrumental in getting the Congress party working committee to vote for partition. Vallabhbhai Patel is also credited with integrating peacefully most of the princely states of independent India.

Jagjivan Ram went on to serve as a minister with various portfolios during [0]'s tenure and in Shastri and Indira Gandhi governments.Morarji Desai was a nationalist with anti-corruption leanings but was socially conservative, pro-business, and in favour of free enterprise reforms, as opposed to [0]'s socialistic policies. After serving as chief minister of Bombay State, Morarji Desai joined Nehru's cabinet in 1956 as the finance minister of India. Morarji Desai held the finance minister of India until 1963 when Morarji Desai along with other senior ministers in Nehru's cabinet resigned under the Kamaraj plan.The plan, as proposed by Madras Chief Minister K.Kamaraj, was to revert government ministers to party positions after a certain tenure and vice versa. With [0]'s age and health failing in the early 1960s, Morarji Desai was considered a possible contender for the position of Prime Minister. Later  Morarji Desai alleged that [0] used the Kamaraj plan to remove all possible contenders 'from the path of Indira Gandhi. Morarji Desai succeeded Indira Gandhi as the prime minister in 1977 when Morarji Desai was selected by the victorious Janata alliance as the victorious Janata alliance's parliamentary leader.Govind Ballabh Pant (1887\u20131961) was a key figure in the Indian independence movement and later a pivotal figure in the politics of Uttar Pradesh (UP) and in the Indian government.

Deshmukh remained a member of the Planning Commission. C. D. Deshmukh's tenure\u2014during which C. D. Deshmukh delivered six budgets and an interim budget\u2014is noted for the effective management of the Indian economy and the Indian economy's steady growth which saw the Indian economy recover from the impacts of the events of the 1940s.

Krishna Menon (1896\u20131974) was a close associate of [0] and has been described by some as the second most powerful man in independent India during [0]'s tenure as prime minister. Under [0], V. K. Krishna Menon (1896\u20131974) served as independent India's high commissioner to the UK, UN ambassador, and Union minister of defence. V. K. Krishna Menon (1896\u20131974) resigned after the debacle of the 1962 China War.In the years following independence, [0] frequently turned to Indira Gandhi for managing [0]'s personal affairs.  Indira Gandhi moved into [0]'s official residence to attend to [0] and became [0]'s constant companion in [0]'s travels across independent India and the world. Indira Gandhi would virtually become [0]'s chief of staff. Towards the end of the 1950s, Indira Gandhi served as the president of the Congress. In that capacity, Indira Gandhi was instrumental in getting the Communist-led Kerala State Government dismissed in 1959. Indira Gandhi was elected as Congress party president in 1959, which aroused criticism for alleged nepotism, although [0] had actually disapproved of Indira Gandhi's , partly because [0] considered that elected smacked of \"dynasticism\"; [0] said, indeed elected was \"wholly undemocratic and an undesirable thing\", and refused Indira Gandhi a position in [0]'s cabinet. Indira Gandhi was at loggerheads with Indira Gandhi's over policy; most notably, Indira Gandhi used [0]'s oft-stated personal deference to the Congress party working committee to push through dismissedthe Communist-led Kerala State Government, over [0]'s own objections. [0] began to be embarrassed by Indira Gandhi's ruthlessness and disregard for parliamentary tradition and was \"hurt\" by what [0] saw as an assertiveness with no purpose other than to stake out an identity independent of Indira Gandhi's ."}, "Relationships": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. After Kamala's death in 1936, [0] was rumoured to have relationships with several women. several women included Shraddha Mata, Padmaja Naidu and Edwina Mountbatten. Edwina Mountbatten's daughter Lady Pamela Hicks acknowledged Nehru's platonic relationship with Lady Mountbatten.British historian Philip Ziegler, with access to the private letters and diaries, concludes Nehru's platonic relationship with Lady Mountbatten:was to endure until Edwina Mountbatten's death: intensely loving, romantic, trusting, generous, idealistic, even spiritual. If there was any physical element any physical element can only have been of minor importance to either party. Edwina Mountbatten's reaction was one of pleasure....Edwina Mountbatten liked and admired [0], it was useful to Edwina Mountbatten that [0] should find such attractions in Edwina Mountbatten's home, it was agreeable to find Edwina Mountbatten almost permanently in good temper: the advantages of Nehru's platonic relationship with Lady Mountbatten were obvious. [0]'s sister, Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit told Pupul Jayakar, Indira Gandhi's friend and biographer, that Padmaja Naidu and [0] lived together for many years."}, "Religion and personal beliefs": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. Described as a Hindu agnostic, and styling [0] as a \"scientific humanist\", [0] thought that religious taboos were preventing India from moving forward and adapting to modern conditions: \"No country or people who are slaves to dogma and dogmatic mentality can progress, and unhappily our country and people have become extraordinarily dogmatic and little-minded.\"The spectacle of what is called religion, or at any rate organised religion, in India and elsewhere, has filled [0] with horror and [0] have frequently condemned religion, or at any rate organised religion and wished to make a clean sweep of religion, or at any rate organised religion. Almost always religion, or at any rate organised religion seemed to stand for blind belief and reaction, dogma and bigotry, superstition, exploitation and the preservation of vested interests. As a humanist, [0] considered that [0]'s afterlife was not in some mystical heaven or reincarnation but in the practical achievements of a life lived fully with and for [0]'s fellow human beings: \u201c\u2026Nor am [0] greatly interested in life after death. [0] find the problems of this life sufficiently absorbing to fill [0]'s mind,\u201d [0] wrote. In [0]'s Last Will and Testament, [0] wrote: \u201c[0] wish to declare with all earnestness that [0] do not want any religious ceremonies performed for [0] after [0]'s death. [0] do not believe in such ceremonies, and to submit to such ceremonies, even as a matter of form, would be hypocrisy and an attempt to delude ourselves and others.\u201dIn [0]'s autobiography, [0] analysed Abrahamic and Indian religions and Abrahamic and Indian religions's impact on India. [0] wanted to model India as a secular country; [0]'s secularist policies remain a subject of debate."}, "Legacy": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0], next to Mahatma Gandhi, is regarded as the most significant figure of the Indian independence movement that successfully ended British rule over the Indian subcontinent.As India's's first Prime minister and external affairs minister, [0] played a major role in shaping India's's government and political culture along with the sound foreign policy. [0] is praised for creating a system providing universal primary education, reaching children in the farthest corners of rural India. [0]'s education policy is also credited for the development of world-class educational institutions like the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Indian Institutes of Technology, and the Indian Institutes of Management.Following the independence, [0] popularized the credo of 'unity in diversity' and implemented the credo of 'unity in diversity' as state policy. This proved particularly important as post-Independence differences surfaced since British withdrawal from the Indian subcontinent prompted regional leaders to no longer relate to one another as allies against a common adversary. While differences in culture and, especially, language threatened the unity of India's, [0] established programs such as the National Book Trust and the National Literary Academy which promoted the translation of regional works of literatures between languages and organised the transfer of materials between regions. In pursuit of a single, unified India, [0] warned, \"Integrate or perish.\"Called an \"architect of India's\", [0] is widely recognized as the greatest figure of India's after Mahatma Gandhi. On the occasion of [0]'s first death anniversary in 1965, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, Lal Bahadur Shastri and others described [0] as the greatest figure of India's after Mahatma Gandhi.Writing in 2005, Ramachandra Guha wrote that while no other Indian prime minister was ever close to the challenges that [0] dealt with and if [0] had died in 1958 then [0] would be remembered as the greatest statesman of the 20th century. However, in recent years, [0]'s reputation has seen re-emergence and [0] is credited for keeping India's together contrary to predictions of many that India's was bound to fall apart.", "Commemoration": "[0] is our person to focus on. In [0]'s lifetime, [0] enjoyed an iconic status in India and was generally admired across the world for [0]'s idealism and statesmanship. [0]'s ideals and policies continue shaping the Congress Party's's manifesto and core political philosophy. [0]'s birthday, 14\u00a0November is celebrated in India as Bal Divas (\"Children's Day\") in recognition of [0]'s lifelong passion and work for the welfare, education and development of children and young people. Children across India remember [0] as Chacha Nehru (\"Uncle Nehru\"). [0] remains a popular symbol of the Congress Party's. people often emulate [0]'s style of clothing, especially the Gandhi cap and the [0] jacket. [0]'s preference for the sherwani ensured the sherwani continues to be considered formal wear in North India today. Many public institutions and memorials across India are dedicated to [0]'s memory. The Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi is among the most prestigious universities in India. The [0] Port near the city of Mumbai is a modern port and dock designed to handle a huge cargo and traffic load. [0]'s residence in Delhi is preserved as the Teen Murti House now has the [0] Memorial Museum & Library, and one of five [0] Planetariums that were set in the city of Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Allahabad and Pune.

In 1997, [0] was voted as the greatest Indian since independence in India Today's poll. In 2012, [0] ranked number four in Outlook's poll of The Greatest Indian.", "In popular culture": "[0] is our person to focus on. There have been many documentaries about [0]'s life, and [0] has been portrayed in fictionalised films. The canonical performance is probably that of Roshan Seth, who played [0] three times: in Richard Attenborough's 1982 film Gandhi, Shyam Benegal's's 1988 television series Bharat Ek Khoj, based on [0]'s The Discovery of India, and in a 2007 TV film entitled The Last Days of the Raj. Shyam Benegal's directed the 1984 documentary film, Nehru, covering [0]'s political career.

Another 1957 English language short documentary Our Prime Minister was produced, compiled and directed by Ezra Mir, who also directed Three weeks in the life of [0] in 1962. Girish Karnad's historical play, Tughlaq (1962) is an allegory about the Nehruvian era. Girish Karnad's historical play, Tughlaq (1962) was staged by Ebrahim Alkazi with the National School of Drama Repertory at Purana Qila, Delhi in the 1970s and later at the Festival of India, London in 1982."}, "Writings": {"": "[0] is our person to focus on. [0] was a prolific writer in English who wrote The Discovery of India, Glimpses of World History, An Autobiography (released in the United States as \"Toward Freedom,\") and Letters from a Father to His Daughter, all written in jail. Letters from a Father to His Daughter comprised 30 letters written to a Father's daughter Indira Priyadarshani Nehru (later Gandhi) who was then 10 years old and studying at a boarding school in Mussoorie. Letters from a Father to His Daughter attempted to instruct His Daughter about natural history and world civilisations.Nehru's books have been widely read. An Autobiography (released in the United States as \"Toward Freedom,\"), in particular, has been critically acclaimed. John Gunther, writing in Inside Asia, contrasted An Autobiography (released in the United States as \"Toward Freedom,\") with His Daughter's autobiography:  The Mahatma's placid story compares to [0]'s as a cornflower to an orchid, a rhyming couplet to a sonnet by MacLeish or Auden, a water pistol to a machine gun. An Autobiography (released in the United States as \"Toward Freedom,\") is subtle, complex, discriminating, infinitely cultivated, steeped in doubt, suffused with intellectual passion. Lord Halifax once said that no one could understand India without reading An Autobiography (released in the United States as \"Toward Freedom,\"); An Autobiography (released in the United States as \"Toward Freedom,\") is a kind of 'Education of Henry Adams,' written in superlative prose\u2014hardly a dozen men alive write English as well as [0] ... Michael Brecher, who considered [0] to be an intellectual for whom ideas were important aspects of Indian nationalism, wrote in Political Leadership and Charisma: [0], Ben-Gurion, and Other 20th-Century Political Leaders:  Nehru's books were not scholarly, nor were Nehru's books intended to be. [0] was not a trained historian, but [0]'s feel for the flow of events and [0]'s capacity to weave together a wide range of knowledge in a meaningful pattern give to Nehru's books qualities of a high order. In Nehru's books, [0] also revealed a sensitive literary style.  ... Glimpses of World History is the most illuminating on Nehru as an intellectual. The first of the trilogy, Glimpses, was a series of thinly connected sketches of the story of mankind in the form of letters to His Daughter. ... Despite The first of the trilogy, Glimpses,'s polemical character in many sections and The first of the trilogy, Glimpses,'s shortcomings as an impartial history, Glimpses is a work of great artistic value, a worthy precursor of An Autobiography (released in the United States as \"Toward Freedom,\"). Michael Crocker thought An Autobiography would have given [0] literary fame had the political fame eluded [0]: It is to [0]'s years in prison that we owe Nehru's books, ... [0]'s writings illustrate a cerebral life, and a power of self-discipline, altogether out of the ordinary. Words by the million bubbled up out of [0]'s fullness of mind and spirit. Had [0] never been prime minister of India [0] would have been famous as the author of An Autobiography (released in the United States as \"Toward Freedom,\") and the autobiographical parts of The Discovery of India. An Autobiography, at least with some excisions here and there, is likely to be read for generations. ... There are, for instance, the characteristic touches of truism and anticlimax, strange in a man who could both think and, at [0]'s best, write so well ... Nehru's speech A Tryst With Destiny was rated by the British newspaper The Guardian to be among the great speeches of the 20th-century. Ian Jack wrote in Ian Jack's introduction to Nehru's speech A Tryst With Destiny:  Dressed in a golden silk jacket with a red rose in the buttonhole, [0] rose to speak. [0]'s sentences were finely made and memorable \u2013 [0] was a good writer; The Discovery of India stands well above the level reached by most politician-writers. ... The nobility of Nehru's words \u2013 Nehru's words's sheer sweep \u2013 provided India with a lodestone that was ambitious and humane. Post-colonialism began here as well as Indian democracy, which has since outlived many expectations of its deathIndian democracy, which has since outlived many expectations of its death's .
