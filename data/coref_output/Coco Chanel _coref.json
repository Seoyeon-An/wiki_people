The family resided in run-down lodgings. In 1884, Albert Chanel married Eug\u00e9nie Jeanne Devolle Chanel, known as Jeanne, a laundrywoman,, persuaded to legitimate his children by Eug\u00e9nie Jeanne Devolle Chanel, known as Jeanne, a laundrywoman,'s family who had \"united, effectively, to pay Albert Chanel\".:\u200a16\u200aAt birth, [0]'s name was entered into the official registry as \"Chasnel\". Eug\u00e9nie Jeanne Devolle Chanel, known as Jeanne, a laundrywoman, was too unwell to attend the official registry, and Albert Chanel was registered as \"traveling\".:\u200a16\u200a With both parents absent, [0]'s last name was misspelled, probably due to a clerical error.[citation needed]She went to [0]'s grave as [0] because to correct, legally, the misspelled name on [0]'s birth certificate would reveal that [0] was born in a poor house hospice. The family had six children\u2014the first, Julia,, [0], Alphonse (the first boy, born 1885), Antoinette (born 1887), Lucien, and Augustin (who died at six months)\u2014and lived crowded into a one-room lodging in the town of Brive-la-Gaillarde.When [0] was 11, Eug\u00e9nie Jeanne Devolle Chanel, known as Jeanne, a laundrywoman, died at the age of 32.:\u200a18\u200a his children did not attend school. Albert Chanel sent Albert Chanel's two sons to work as farm laborers and sent Albert Chanel's three daughters to the convent of Aubazine, which ran an orphanage. the convent of Aubazine, which ran an orphanage's religious order, the Congregation of the Sacred Heart of Mary, was \"founded to care for the poor and rejected, including running homes for abandoned and orphaned girls\".:\u200a27\u200a It was a stark, frugal life, demanding strict discipline. Placement in the convent of Aubazine, which ran an orphanage may have contributed to [0]'s future career, as the convent of Aubazine, which ran an orphanage was where [0] learned to sew.

[0] was a poseuse, a performer who entertained the crowd between star turns. The money earned was what the crowd managed to accumulate when the plate was passed. It was at this time that [0] acquired the name \"Coco\" when [0] spent [0]'s nights singing in a cabaret frequented by cavalry officers, often the song, \"Who Has Seen Coco?\" [0] often liked to say the name \"Coco\" was given to [0] by [0]'s father. Others believe the name \"Coco\" came from Ko Ko Ri Ko, and Qui qu'a vu Coco, or the name \"Coco\" was an allusion to the French word for kept woman, cocotte. As an entertainer, [0] radiated a juvenile allure that tantalized the military habitu\u00e9s of a cabaret frequented by cavalry officers.In 1906, [0] worked in the spa resort town of Vichy. the spa resort town of Vichy boasted a profusion of concert halls, theatres, and caf\u00e9s where [0] hoped to achieve success as a performer.

A roadside memorial at the site of one of Balsan's friends, Captain Arthur Edward 'Boy' Capel's is said to have been commissioned by [0]. Twenty-five years after a car accident, Chanel, then residing in Switzerland, confided to [0]'s friend, Paul Morand, \"one of Balsan's friends, Captain Arthur Edward 'Boy' Capel's was a terrible blow to [0].

As 21 rue Cambon, Paris already housed an established clothing business, [0] sold only [0]'s millinery creations at 21 rue Cambon, Paris.

The fashions were constructed from humble fabrics such as jersey and tricot, at the time primarily used for men's underwear. The location was a prime one, in the center of Deauville on a fashionable street. Here [0] sold hats, jackets, sweaters, and the marini\u00e8re, the sailor blouse.
